# Survival of the Subnormal mind

_By Rick Lyon, South Bend, IN_ 

This article was first published in the UAI Journal, in April, 2012. 

_Make not the mistake of estimating the soul’s worth by the imperfections of the mind or by the appetites of the body. Judge not the soul nor evaluate its destiny by the standard of a single unfortunate human episode. Your spiritual destiny is conditioned only by your spiritual longings and purposes._ [156:5.9] (P. 1739:4) 

This article has taken me a few years to write. During that time a lot has changed. My thinking about this topic has evolved and the reason for writing it took on greater significance. I finished this article several times but I was never convinced of the very thing I was trying to prove or disprove—until now. 

Does a person who does not have a normal mind survive mortal death? As the father of a mentally handicapped son I struggled with this question for many years. I suspect that all parents of a mentally handicapped child do too. 

My son, Bradford E. Lyon, was born November 6, 1978, and passed away September 19, 2010. 1978 was the same year that I discovered _The Urantia Book_. Even though life with Brad presented its challenges, we loved him with all our heart. We kept him at home as long as we could and took him everywhere and did all the typical family things trying to make his life as “normal” as we could. 

When Brad became physically bigger and stronger than his mother, we were forced to do something we did not want to do. 

Brad had problems even before he was born, and when the happy day came it was soon apparent that his problems were just beginning. His first month of life was filled with episodes of projectile vomiting and no dirty diapers. The doctors said that it was just the formula so try something different. We did—several times. Breastfeeding was totally out of vogue at that time so it wasn’t even considered. The young inexperienced mother finally threw a screaming temper tantrum in the doctor’s office. The result was the discovery of an intestinal blockage called pyloric stenosis. This required surgery to correct. Brad had not taken in any nourishment and little liquid during the first 30 days of his life. 

All seemed well after that. Of course, he was late on his childhood milestones because he had a rough start—at least that is what everyone told us. We heard all the comforting excuses and made up some of our own. At age 2, he was diagnosed as autistic and moderately to severely mentally retarded. With the diagnosis came some relief to finally know what was wrong with our son, but the guilt and anger came next. His mom continues to blame herself even today. We kept Brad at home until he got so big that his mom was a wreck from the “aggressive behavior” he exhibited every day, even when we gave him whatever we thought he wanted he still had his “behaviors”. 

At age 14 when he was physically bigger than his mom, her attempts to control his behaviors and take care of him were rewarded with bruises and scratches and the fear of something worse. Brad went through a period of self-injury that included biting himself. During a really bad seizure his mom took him to the emergency room. After seeing the bite marks on Brad the police were called and she was questioned and accused of abusing her son. She nearly went to jail because of the ignorance of the emergency room staff about autism at that time. 

The purpose of this article is to share with you our own personal growth in understanding these questions. Perhaps we will see how applying The Urantia Book teachings to our daily life situations can help us to understand them and react to them in a more positive manner. We can put the teachings into action and grow and benefit from them. I hope this article will bring the peace we have found in _The Urantia Book_ concerning our son to you who have similar circumstances. Let me thank my wife Shelia for her help in researching the eulogy for Brad. Shelia supposedly doesn’t read the book but somehow she sure knows a lot about what it says. Because of her, what I said at Brad’s funeral was greatly improved and what I believed changed too—something good that resulted from something bad. Just the process of searching the teachings for the right words to say helped me to come to terms with things that I have struggled with for years concerning my son. Of course there are not enough words to describe the love, loyalty, and courage of Brad’s mom, Deborah. 

Three questions that concerned us as Brad’s parents were: 

Why is Brad the way he is? 

What will happen to Brad if we die? 

What will happen to Brad when he dies? 

The first question, “Why is Brad the way he is?” is one that all parents of a handicapped child will ask and the next one is usually “Why did God let his happen?” A few years after Brad was born I once told a friend of mine who had a severely handicapped newborn child that first you blame yourself; then you blame your spouse; then you blame God; and then you finally realize that nobody is to blame, but you are left with the confusion and frustration of “Why?” The conclusion that I came to was that this is a material life with material bodies and like any material thing on an imperfect world, they sometimes break or go bad, or eventually wear out. 

Jesus said, _“In the matter of sickness and health, you should know that these bodily states are the result of material causes; health is not the smile of heaven, neither is affliction the frown of God .”_ [166:4.10] (P. 1831:1) 

The difficulties of Brad’s life were not in any way a sign of God’s disfavor with him or us. Brad was simply an innocent victim of one of the material accidents of time. Such occurrences are not pre-arranged or otherwise produced by the spiritual forces of the realm. Our Father does not cause or send pain and suffering upon us. _“The Father causes his rain to fall on the just and the unjust; the sun likewise shines on the righteous and the unrighteous...”_ [166:4.4] (P. 1830:4) I think this means that bad things happen to good people just as good things happen to bad people. The situations in life are different for each person but our lives are made up of both good and bad events regardless of who we are or what kind of person we are. If I have learned anything from my 58 years on this planet it is that good things often come from bad experiences. Often there is a benefit to suffering or the difficulties and disappointments of life. 

So, why do bad things, or what we perceive as bad things, happen? From The Urantia Book we are told: “The uncertainties of life and the vicissitudes of existence do not in any manner contradict the concept of the universal sovereignty of God. All evolutionary creature life is beset by certain inevitabilities .” [3:5.5] (P. 51) 

Consider the following: 

> “Is courage—strength of character—desirable? Then must man be reared in an environment which necessitates grappling with hardships and reacting to disappointments. [3:5.6] (P. 51:5) 
> 
> Is altruism—service of one’s fellows—desirable? Then must life experience provide for encountering situations of social inequality. [3:5.7] (P. 51:6)] 
> 
> Is hope—the grandeur of trust—desirable? Then human existence must constantly be confronted with insecurities and recurrent uncertainties. [3:5.8] (P. 51:7) 
> 
> Is faith—the supreme assertion of human thought— desirable? Then must the mind of man find itself in that troublesome predicament where it ever knows less than it can believe. [3:5.9] (P. 51:8) 
> 
> Is pleasure—the satisfaction of happiness—desirable? Then must man live in a world where the alternative of pain and the likelihood of suffering are ever-present experiential possibilities. ” [3:5.14] (P.51:8) 

We are also told that the greatest affliction is to have never been afflicted. It is often the bad things in life that make us appreciate the good. It is the ugliness in this world that makes us appreciate the beauty of God’s creation. It is the potential of evil that gives us the opportunity to choose the good. In the mind of God there is a plan, but as mortals on this tiny isolated material world it is nearly impossible for us to comprehend that plan. While at times we may question God’s ways and wonder why things happen the way they do, all we can do is believe and put our faith in God and in the wisdom of his plan, for we know that our Father loves us unconditionally and he would never do anything to hurt us. The ways of God are true, beautiful, and good. It is the truth, beauty, and goodness instilled in us by the indwelling spirit that leads us to love our children, our grandchildren, and each other. 

Why was Brad the way he was? The simple answer is because something went wrong during the material development of his physical body. Brad’s hardships and disappointments gave us courage to fight for his happiness and well-being. The unfairness of Brad’s situation inspired many to serve as caregivers and their service no doubt brought them spiritual satisfaction. The uncertainty of his survival and the reasons for his problems caused us to have faith because we believed more than we knew about Brad’s life and his future. Brad’s pain and suffering caused us to appreciate our own health and happiness and that of his sibling and our grandchildren. Caring for Brad made us unselfish as we chose to put his needs above our own. 

The second question, “What will happen to Brad if we die?” is a question concerning the care of Brad while here on Urantia. Since Brad has gone before us this is no longer of concern. However, let me share this quote with you that I think does relate to Brad’s life here. _“The teaching about guardian angels is not a myth; certain groups of human beings do actually have personal angels. It was in recognition of this that Jesus, in speaking of the children of the heavenly kingdom_, said: ‘’ _Take heed that you despise not one of these little ones, for I say to you, their angels do always behold the presence of the spirit of my Father .’’_ [113:1.1] (P, 1241:3) 

The conclusion that I came to was that this is a material life with material bodies and like any material thing on an imperfect world, they sometimes break or go bad, or eventually wear out. 

> Originally, the seraphim were definitely assigned to the separate Urantia races. But since the bestowal of Michael, they are assigned in accordance with human intelligence, spirituality, and destiny. Intellectually, mankind is divided into three classes: [113:1.2] P, 1241:4) 
> 
> ... The subnormal minded—those who do not exercise normal will power; those who do not make average decisions. This class embraces those who cannot comprehend God; they lack capacity for the intelligent worship of Deity. The subnormal beings of Urantia have a corps of seraphim, one company, with one battalion of cherubim, assigned to minister to them and to witness that justice and mercy are extended to them in the life struggles of the sphere._ [113:1.3] (P. 1241:5) 

Had Brad outlived his parents, the Guardian Angels would have continued to watch over him. 

As for the third question—which is the focus of this article, “What will happen to Brad when he dies?” If we study things like the planetary nursery and the subnormal minded, perhaps we can find an answer to this. This question always seems to come up in study group at some point because of my son Brad. The more we discuss it, the more an answer seems to elude me. I came to believe that I finally knew the answer to this question, but now I believe that I was wrong about it. 

Because Brad did not have a normal mind, does that mean that he was merely an animal and not human? Since he could not make a moral choice (or at least a moral choice that we could perceive) was he unable to receive an adjuster? Since he could not receive an adjuster was he less than human? 

> “The survival of mortal creatures is wholly predicated on the evolvement of an immortal soul within the mortal mind .” [36:6.5] (P. 404:3) 

Since I believed that Brad had not received an Adjuster’. I felt that Brad would not survive. However, how could I know that Brad never made a moral decision? Brad was kind to others, loved babies, loved us, and would share with others. Maybe Brad’s “problem” was more of a problem with my thinking than with Brad himself. 

> “Mortal mind, prior to death, is self-consciously independent of the Adjuster presence; adjutant mind needs only the associated material-energy pattern to enable it to operate .” [112:6.7] (P.1236:5) 

So, Brad was mortal even without the Adjuster presence, and the Adjutant Mind Spirits functioned in him. 

> “...The subnormal man should be kept under society’s control: no more should be produced than are required to administer the lower levels of industry, those tasks require intelligence above the animal level .” [68:6.11] (P. 770:8) 

A subnormal man functions at an intelligence level above that of an animal. So, now I believe that Brad was not merely an animal in a human body. I always treated Brad as a person, as my son, and never as anything less than a human. It is strange sometimes, the struggles that we inflict upon ourselves through the lack of understanding. I was confused about when does our time run out to make our “final choice”? If a person is incapable of making an average decision, can they make such an important decision as choosing to do God’s will rather than their own? Must it be made before mortal death? Does a person who is not of normal mind have survival potential? My opinion was that they did not because they did not receive a Thought Adjuster. I based this belief on this quote: 

> “If the finite mind of man is unable to comprehend how so great and so majestic a God as the Universal Father can descend from his eternal abode in infinite perfection to fraternize with the individual human creature, then must such a finite intellect rest assurance of divine fellowship upon the truth of the fact that an actual fragment of the living God resides within the intellect of every normal-minded and morally conscious Urantia mortal .” [5:0.1] (P.62:1) 

And: 

> “Thereafter all normal-minded will creatures of that world will receive Adjusters as soon as they attain the age of moral responsibility, of spiritual choice. ” [52:5.6] (P.596.4)] 

Because I read things like this I came to believe that Brad did not have survival potential because he was unable to make a choice of anything beyond his immediate material needs. My confusion grew as Brad passed his sixteenth birthday because: “ _Any time after sixteen, if final choice has been made, they translate to the first mansion world and begin their Paradise ascent. Some make a choice before this age and go on to the ascension spheres, but very few children under sixteen years of age, as reckoned by Urantia standards, will be found on the mansion worlds._ ” [47:2.5] (P. 532:3) 

At the time of Brad’s passing, he was 31 years old with the mental age of 2-3 years old. He was an adult body with a child mind. Does the above quote refer to material age or mental age? Part of me thought it referred to material age because it says ‘’as reckoned by Urantia standards’’. Part of me thought it did not because why would the age of the material body have any value to a spiritual decision? Since Brad was 31 years old, it seemed that the issue was no longer valid as he was past the age of 16 and had not been able to make his choice—but how many normal minded people over the age of 16 have not made that choice either? 

Was Brad a child that qualified for the nursery or was he an adult who missed his chance? Is not making a choice the same as rejection of God? Maybe this question could help us to understand the situation that faces our loved ones who also don’t make their choice during this mortal life. Do they get the chance to make their choice after mortal death? When does the time to make our choice run out? I always treated Brad as a person, as my son, and never as anything less than a human. 

Children who have not yet received an adjuster do survive. An infant who is not yet capable of making an average decision does survive. Apparently making the final decision about God is not required prior to mortal death. It must be made at some point, before we can leave the mansion worlds but we are given every opportunity to make that choice until the final choice—either way—is made. 

> “ Eternal survival of personality is wholly dependent on the choosing of the mortal mind, whose decisions determine the survival potential of the immortal soul. When the mind believes God and the soul knows God, and when, with the fostering Adjuster, they all desire God, then is survival assured. Limitations of intellect, curtailment of education, deprivation of culture, impoverishment of social status, even inferiority of the human standards of morality resulting from the unfortunate lack of educational, cultural, and social advantages, cannot invalidate the presence of the divine spirit in such unfortunate and humanly handicapped but believing individuals. The indwelling of the Mystery Monitor constitutes the inception and insures the possibility of the potential of growth and survival of the immortal soul. ” [5:5.13] (P. 69-70) 

This paragraph confused me because on the one hand survival is dependent upon making a decision, but on the other hand the limitations of intellect do not “invalidate” the presence of the indwelling adjuster.   

> “Though the cosmic circles of personality growth must eventually be attained, if, through no fault of your own, the accidents of time and the handicaps of material existence prevent your mastering these levels on your native planet, if your intentions and desires are of survival value, there are issued the decrees of probation extension. You will be afforded additional time in which to prove yourself. [112:5.6] (P.1233:2) 

> “If ever there is doubt as to the advisability of advancing a human identity to the mansion worlds, the universe governments invariably rule in the personal interests of that individual; they unhesitatingly advance such a soul to the status of a transitional being, while they continue their observations of the emerging morontia intent and spiritual purpose. Thus divine justice is certain of achievement, and divine mercy is accorded further opportunity for extending its ministry. [112:5.7] (P.1233:3) 

> “The governments of Orvonton and Nebadon do not claim absolute perfection for the detail working of the universal plan of mortal repersonalization, but they do claim to, and actually do, manifest patience, tolerance, understanding, and merciful sympathy. We had rather assume the risk of a system rebellion than to court the hazard of depriving one struggling mortal from any evolutionary world of the eternal joy of pursuing the ascending career._ [112:5.8] (P. 1233:4) 
> 
> “This does not mean that human beings are to enjoy a second opportunity in the face of the rejection of a first, not at all. But it does signify that all will creatures are to experience one true opportunity to make one undoubted, self-conscious, and final choice. The sovereign Judges of the universes will not deprive any being of personality status who has not finally and fully made the eternal choice; the soul of man must and will be given full and ample opportunity to reveal its true intent and real purpose .”_ [112:5.9] (P.1233:5) 

I now believe that because of the patience, tolerance, understanding, and merciful sympathy of the governing bodies of Orvonton and Nebadon that Brad will be afforded additional time and accorded further opportunity in which to make his choice and shall not be deprived of the eternal joy of pursuing the ascending career. The failure to make a final choice concerning God before mortal death will not prevent Brad’s survival and advancement to the mansion worlds. I now believe that the mental handicaps that my son had will not prevent him from being given full and ample opportunity to make one undoubted, self- conscious, and final choice. 

So, how about the inability to acquire a Thought Adjuster prior to mortal death? We read in Paper 47 about the probationary nursery on mansion world number one: _“This probation nursery of Satania is maintained by certain morontia personalities on the finaliters’ world, one half of the planet being devoted to this work of child rearing. Here are received and reassembled certain children of surviving mortals, such as those offspring who perished on the evolutionary worlds before acquiring spiritual status as individuals. The ascension of either of its natural parents insures that such a mortal child of the realms will be accorded repersonalization on the system finaliter planet and there be permitted to demonstrate by subsequent freewill choice whether or not it elects to follow the parental path of mortal ascension..._ [45:6.7] (P. 516.5) 

> “The infant-receiving schools of Satania are situated on the finaliter world, the first of the Jerusem transitionculture spheres. These infant-receiving schools are enterprises devoted to the nurture and training of the children of time, including those who have died on the evolutionary worlds of space before the acquirement of individual status on the universe records. In the event of the survival of either or both of such a child’s parents, the guardian of destiny deputizes her associated cherubim as the custodian of the child’s potential identity, charging the cherubim with the responsibility of delivering this undeveloped soul into the hands of the Mansion World Teachers in the probationary nurseries of the morontia worlds .” [47:2.1] ( P. 531:5) 

I now believe that because of the patience, tolerance, understanding, and merciful sympathy of the governing bodies of Orvonton and Nebadon that Brad will be afforded additional time and accorded further opportunity in which to make his choice and shall not be deprived of the eternal joy of pursuing the ascending career. 

It seems that a lot of effort goes into the education and training of undeveloped souls in order to promote their spiritual survival. 

> “It is these same deserted cherubim who, as Mansion World Teachers, under the supervision of the Melchizedeks, maintain such extensive educational facilities for the training of the probationary wards of the finaliters. These wards of the finaliters, these infants of ascending mortals, are always personalized as of their exact physical status at the time of death except for reproductive potential. This awakening occurs at the exact time of the parental arrival on the first mansion world. And then are these children given every opportunity, as they are, to choose the heavenly way just as they would have made such a choice on the worlds where death so untimely terminated their careers .” [47:2.2] (P. 531:6)
> 
> “On the nursery world, probationary creatures are grouped according to whether or not they have Adjusters, for the Adjusters come to indwell these material children just as on the worlds of time. Children of pre-Adjuster ages are cared for in families of five, ranging in ages from one year and under up to approximately five years, or that age when the Adjuster arrives. [47:2.3] (P. 532:1) 
> 
> “ All children on the evolving worlds who have Thought Adjusters, but who before death had not made a choice concerning the Paradise career, are also repersonalized on the finaliter world of the system, where they likewise grow up in the families of the Material Sons and their associates as do those little ones who arrived without Adjusters, but who will subsequently receive the Mystery Monitors after attaining the requisite age of moral choice .” [47:2.4] (P. 532:2) 
> 
> “The guardian seraphim attend these youths in the probationary nursery on the finaliter world just as they spiritually minister to mortals on the evolutionary planets, while the faithful spornagia minister to their physical necessities. And so do these children grow up on the transition world until such time as they make their final choice. [47:2.6] (P. 532:4) 
> 
> “When material life has run its course, if no choice has been made for the ascendant life, or if these children of time definitely decide against the Havona adventure, death automatically terminates their probationary careers. There is no adjudication of such cases; there is no resurrection from such a second death. They simply become as though they had not been. [47:2.7] (P, 532:5) 
> 
> “But if they choose the Paradise path of perfection, they are immediately made ready for translation to the first mansion world, where many of them arrive in time to join their parents in the Havona ascent. After passing through Havona and attaining the Deities, these salvaged souls of mortal origin constitute the permanent ascendant citizenship of Paradise. These children who have been deprived of the valuable and essential evolutionary experience on the worlds of mortal nativity are not mustered into the Corps of the Finality. ” [47:2.8] (P. 532:6) 

Does a person of subnormal mind survive mortal death? Let me point out: subnormal minded people are not animals but are mortals with less intelligent minds who function on levels higher than animals. 

The first mansion world has a nursery dedicated to the pre-choice children of surviving mortals. Infants who have not yet received a Thought Adjuster have survival potential and are kept safe in the planetary nursery until a parent arrives to make decisions concerning their future. 

Thought Adjusters come to indwell the children of the planetary nursery just as they would on this material world. 

A corps of seraphim, one company, with one battalion of cherubim, minister to the subnormal children of Urantia to assure that justice and mercy are extended to the subnormal minded in this material life. 

Mansion World Teachers, under the supervision of the Melchizedeks, maintain extensive educational facilities for the training of the probationary wards of the finaliters. Finaliters, Melchizedeks, Seraphim, cherubim, and surviving parents all are involved in the mortal and post- mortal life of these undeveloped souls. Education and training in infant-receiving schools are provided to prepare these children of time for the ultimate adventure. A corps of Seraphim and a battalion of cherubim watch over the mortal life of the subnormal minded. It seems that a lot of effort is put forth to care for these imperfect children of this imperfect material world. So apparently they must have potential survival value. We see in _The Urantia Book_ that potential is very important for it is not what we _are_ but what we are **becoming** that is important. In this spiritual universe, I suspect that only real or potential spiritual value is worthy of the efforts of angels and spiritual beings. I now believe that we are assured that the material difficulties and physical imperfections of Brad’s mortal life do not follow him or hinder his potential for an eternal spiritual life or in any way prevent his survival and attainment of the presence of God. 

I am now convinced that Brad is now sleeping, awaiting for his mom or I to arrive and awaken him on the mansion world, where perhaps for the first time he will make a clear and conscious choice about his future. 

I believe that one of the greatest lessons from The Urantia Book is that “ in the mind of God there is a plan ” and that the universe is friendly and everything works for the good. It seems that a lot of effort goes into the education and training of undeveloped souls in order to promote their spiritual survival. 

While Brad’s passing was painful for us, some good has come from it. I did the eulogy for my son because it was the last thing I could do for him. Those who know me personally know what a difficult thing it is for me to speak in front of people. That eulogy allowed me to share teachings from The Urantia Book with family and friends that I have not been able to reach otherwise. I boldly quoted the book and mentioned it by name in the eulogy. The funeral home director told me that, “in 15 years of doing these, that was the best eulogy I’ve ever heard.”—all of it straight from the book. A couple of weeks later, my two sisters showed up at my study group. They came because of what I had said at Brad’s funeral. Brad’s mom (Deborah) has suffered years of guilt over Brad but the words of The Urantia Book washed away this guilt and fear in a way that I was not able to help her with before. My wife Shelia helped me research the words of the eulogy and revealed that she knows a lot more about the book than I realized. The guys at work sent flowers for Brad. So I thanked them for their sympathy, I sent an email to about 750 people at work that said, “While we are sad at the loss of Brad and miss him dearly, we are excited for him because we know that “ death is only the beginning of an endless career of adventure, an everlasting life of anticipation, an eternal voyage of discovery .” [14:5.10] (P. 159) I got about a half dozen nice emails back commenting on this statement. 

The headstone for Brad includes a quote from The Urantia Book to further communicate our beliefs and faith to our family and friends who visit Brad’s gravesite. 

This is where my effort to write this article stalled. Even though the article was complete in my mind it did not feel complete in my heart. There seemed to be something missing—either in my article or in my mind. I would revisit this article from time to time— editing and tweaking, trying to find the conclusion that so far escaped me. I could not figure out why I was reluctant to share it even though it seemed complete. 

Then one day Shelia showed me a YouTube video about a girl named Carly. Carly was almost exactly like Brad in her appearance, mannerisms, and behavior. Carly’s parents were saying words that could have been direct quotes from me and Brad’s mom when speaking about Brad. Let me back up for a moment to add some more similarity between our situation and that of Carly. 

Several years ago I had the idea of programming a computer so that if Brad touched a key on the keyboard it would say a word. I thought this would be something Brad could learn to use to communicate. But I couldn’t figure out how to do it. Sounds simple enough for someone to do though—if you know how to do computer programming. You would think there would be an app for that. I then tried to convince the company that provided for Brad’s 24/7 care to purchase a talking computer. However, they were $30-40,000, which I found hard to believe. Of course I could not afford that. The provider couldn’t either and the state would not approve it because the behavior specialist could not confirm that Brad would be able to use it let alone benefit from it. I suspect now that our evaluation of Brad’s capabilities were much too low. I wish now that I had been one of those parents who fights and demands everything they can get for their child until they get it. But Brad was happy and safe and that is all I ever wanted for him. Perhaps I was terribly mistaken. What if I had pushed the issue of buying a computer or tried harder to do it myself..... 

I have never doubted anything I have found in _The Urantia Book_. Sometimes they make me scratch my head and wonder, but then something happens to convince me of the truth of whatever it was. While I believed all _The Urantia Book_ said about this subject and that I included for this article, I was just never really convinced of what was behind those happy eyes of Brad—was there really a personality with survival potential inside there? I resigned myself to discovering the answer on Mansion World One. 

The YouTube video that convinced me of the truth contained in _The Urantia Book_ about this situation can be found by searching YouTube for: “Carly Autism Story”. You will see that Carly, like Brad, was obviously severely handicapped. 

But one day something wonderful happened. Once again a bad situation caused something good to occur. I will let you discover this for yourself if interested. After watching this video I became totally convinced that my son is now sleeping in the arms of the angels, safe and happy and waiting for me or his mom to come wake him from his slumber. The survival and continuing journey of Brad depends on our survival and we shall not fail him or our Father. I am now convinced that Brad’s physical difficulties do not prevent his eternal survival. I wonder if he is dreaming of that day. I know I am. 

This is the story of my progressive journey concerning my son and his eternal future. I struggled for years wavering between believing that my son would not survive but hoping that I was wrong, to being convinced that he has survived and to be looking forward to monitoring his future growth and progress in service to our Father. I came from believing that Brad had no potential survival value to being convinced of that fact and looking forward to the day when I see him again. I came from feeling somehow responsible for his handicaps and disappointment that he would miss the opportunity to experience the ultimate adventure to knowing that sometime soon he will be able to communicate with a clear functioning mind, a new and improved morontia body, and once again enjoy the loving embrace of a father for his son.

# The Soul-Synthesis Hypothesis 

Paranormal Reflections on Soul-Making and Cosmic Spirituality 

_By Byron Belitsos, San Rafael, CA_ 

One hot and humid summer day in 1962 in suburban Cincinnati, I was engaged in aimless play at our neighborhood pool like any other nine-year-old boy. At one point, I jumped into the kids’ end of the pool—or so I thought. Instead of gently hitting the bottom, I was suddenly lost in ten feet of water. I was so startled by the depth that I began to panic, for I had not yet learned to swim. I struggled and churned, frantic to get my bearings. In a flash, time slowed down as I entered a place of sheer terror. And then I crossed over into a timeless paranormal state. But before I could inhale a gulp of water, I was pulled free by a vigilant lifeguard. 

In those few moments before the rescue, I had a near- death experience (NDE), including what we now call a “life review.” In my mind’s eye, I saw my short life pass before me in a complete review: scenes of my parents, siblings, school chums, teachers, our cat, my bedroom, me riding my bike—an explosion of distinct images of encounters with each important person or thing in my young world. And each scene that paraded through me had an aura of truth and light around it. The feeling associated with this instantaneous experience was rapturous, even though my body was paralyzed with fear. Looking back, I now believe I was given a rare childhood glimpse of the actual contents of my soul. 

I later discovered that the phenomenon of “NDE life reviews” is well-known in scientific and popular literature; indeed, my own mini-life-review is just one small example among hundreds of spectacular NDE life-review accounts documented in numerous popular books, websites, and even academic studies. Reading these accounts today, plus my own experience as a child, leads me to surmise that these events offer paranormal proof of the existence of the human soul. 

My initiatory childhood experience helped lead me, just a decade after it happened, to discover The Urantia Book (or UB)—which of course offers systematic revelatory teachings about the human soul. Four decades later I have been moved to author a book, Your Evolving Soul, that offers my reflections on the nature of the human self and soul. In this work, I explicate the Urantia Revelation through the prism of the teachings about self and soul found in the world’s wisdom traditions, with special emphasis on Buddhism and Christian mysticism. I also show its relationship to Ken Wilber’s contemporary theories of integral psychology and spirituality as well as other theories held by transpersonal psychologists and philosophers. 

I’ve refined the insights that I have carried with me ever since that day in 1962. I now believe, following The Urantia Book, that we all hold within us our life-story-as- a-whole and further, that our soul contains our essential personal experiences that are cumulatively stored up within us. These “soul memories” are not mere denizens of the brain; they will survive the brain and the body. On a daily basis our transcendent soul-story evolves and expands through a process I like to call soul-making,—a phrase that also appears in The Urantia Book and appears to have been borrowed from the poet John Keats—clearly a human source. 

Each person’s growing corpus of soul-creating experiences can suddenly disclose itself when we face mortality or are on the verge of a “supreme decision,” for example. I believe the wondrous and numinous quality of these memories, when they are revealed, is evidence of an immortal pedigree. And that very same notion is also the conclusion of almost every NDE-life-review experiencer whose testimonies we have. 

My further research, inspired by the Urantia Revelation, builds on this foundation. According to what I call the soul-synthesis hypothesis, the human soul consists of the sum total of the energetic record of all of our worthwhile life experiences. In addition, these poignant moments of spiritual significance are our most precious asset by far, as well as being a unique and invaluable contribution to cosmic evolution. We know also that our future identity is built around the surviving soul in the afterlife. 

As I see it, the human soul is a living, growing, shimmering entity of light. But its luminosity differs from the extremely rarified light of the Indwelling Spirit that—according to _The Urantia Book_ as well as poets and Gnostics and mystics—also lives within us. We should never conflate these two very different entities, the soul and the Thought Adjuster; but contemporary New Age thought and transpersonal psychology do just that far too often. 

Instead, we can teach our contemporaries that the evolving soul should be seen as a psychic product of an alchemical blend of widely divergent elements that, in certain moments of daily experience, get “blended” behind the scenes in our deepest interior. This process of soul-synthesis occurs when worthy impulses, intentions, or mental states—especially when these are linked with reflective moral decisions—rise above the instinctive or reactive level of mind to what (according to the midwayers, we are told) should be called the mid-mind. In this psychic domain they engage with the downreach of the indwelling God-self. During this momentary encounter, the Higher- Self-within functions in such a way as to memorialize our most poignant moral decisions. Its intrinsic nature is to always seek out an energetic resonance with our more meaningful thoughts and feelings. And then these two factors—a resonant mental content and its recognition by our inner divinity—meet, merge, and dissolve, so to speak, into one another. And the result is a mixed substance of the subtle realm—our evolving human soul—whose luster is unique. 

In addition, we are told that our God-self has another key function in the inner life: it works to catalyze these more worthy mental events in the first place, thereby guiding our soul to evolve even further—that is, if we are game for the adventure. 

In essence, then, our Thought Adjuster works to inspire, and then select and highlight those mind-moments it deems worthy of immortality. It then deposits these in and as our soul, as potentially eternal memories that survive the death of the body. Finally, I believe the TA performs these same services even if the immediate experience involved is painful or disturbing or even seemingly ordinary. Our afflictions and predicaments and our sincere efforts to adjust to and overcome such difficulties—as well as our aspirations and our efforts to attain worthy goals through steadfast decisions—are especially soul-making. 

Even a child—after having received their Mystery Monitor at around age 6—accumulates a psychic repository of such soul-making memories that are constitutive of its young soul, as I discovered experientially. But to gain any direct awareness of the soul’s subtle content is no small matter. The evolving soul seems to divulge its secrets only when we are in deep and sustained reflection and meditation—or else suddenly in dreams, epiphanies, or calamitous events. But it is especially revealed in NDE life reviews, as I explain in _Your Evolving Soul_. 

The most potent soul-synthesizing situations, we are taught, are those in which we wrestle with challenging dilemmas with an attitude of faith and hopefulness. We especially grow and stretch the soul when we are tested by demanding situations that summon creative choices among competing values, and especially when we follow through on such decisions. And if such choices and the resulting actions are infused with our highest consciousness of truth, beauty, and goodness, then our soul growth is all the more accelerated. As I see it, our true purpose in life is to make such soul-making choices, which prepare us for the eternal life ahead and contribute something unique to the evolution of the Supreme in the Grand universe.

# I, Brother – The Urantia Papers and Issues of Race

_By DJ Marshall, Ft. Wayne, IN_ 

## First impression 

Back in 1971 when I was just becoming enchanted with the Urantia Papers, I was deeply disturbed by sections of the book that discussed race using terms such as “inferior” that, for me, conjured images of the Ku Klux Klan and lynching. 

In spite of my discomfort with those sections of the book dealing with race, I continued reading it and eventually came away with a sense of wonder at the love, patience, and hope that permeated the book. There wasn’t any part of the book that gave greater caring or devoted love to any one race not given to all others. So now, some forty-five years later, I find myself wanting to reconcile the seemingly inconsistent issues of racial superiority/inferiority and the genuine love found in the Urantia Papers. 

I grew up a white Irish catholic in the west end of Pittsburgh which was then notorious for having ready slurs for any and all ethnic groups. Not surprisingly, other than my father I didn’t know an un-prejudiced adult until I was twenty-one. At about that time I found myself in a New Orleans cement masons union where I found myself the only “white boy” (or man) in the union of 200+ journeymen. To my great benefit, the experience was a visceral epiphany about these men that I worked with. These men, in their dreams, their sense of honor, and their willingness to work hard were just like my Dad, they could have been my Dad. 

Of course, there was a small group that really didn’t want to know me in any way that would challenge their prejudice towards all whites. As a result of this, a secondary epiphany highlighted to me how much prejudice hurts. Regardless of whether it’s occasional or persistent it always hurts, it’s always infuriating, and it’s almost always based on non-sense and unfortunately it is everywhere: 

Japanese towards Koreans, Chinese to Indians, 
Protestants to Catholics, Believers to non-believers, 
Jews to gentiles, Parisians to Americans, 
the Intelligent to those less so, 
the Beautiful to those not. 
Men to Women, the Powerful to the Powerless 

I could go on but I think you get the idea, prejudice and its social dysfunction is not difficult to find.   

## Contemporary non-Urantian views of Race 

Prejudice, of course, is often supported by ideas that racial superiority or inferiority is established by “facts” but when you look at the research and literature, you discover that the studies usually revolve around the age-old debate of whether nurture or nature is the basis for individual and/or racial/cultural character. Remarkably, both sides believe that the argument has been decided in their favor. Because advances in genomics have failed to provide definitive proofs, there is still little scientific fact concerning differences in the races, so people too often pre-decide what truth they prefer and select studies or apocrypha that supports that opinion.   

## Urantian view oF race 

The Urantia Book states that there were originally six races of color each with their own characteristics. Unfortunately, descriptors in The Urantia Book (inferior, secondary etc.) that nowadays are considered insults. For those who have read the entire Urantia Book, the sting of these words seems to be the opposite of the otherwise pervasive love, respect, and encouragement given to all races in the Book. So, what is to be done so that readers offended by these words do not begin to question The Urantia Book ’s value? Is there some way these AD 1934 words can be adapted to AD 2018 interpretation? Should we even try? 

In one section of the book readers are warned that some scientific statements found in the book will require revising in the future because the book’s authors were forbidden to present unearned knowledge. Once new scientific facts require such revision, readers were not to let such adaptations cloud the authenticity and credibility of the rest of the book. In a similar manner I am assuming the authors would expect us to adapt “sensitive characterizations” for the contemporary ear as long as the underlying meanings and value of the passages were kept true. The following is an attempt to do just that. 

## Superior vs. Inferior Races 

There is a conviction in the mind of many that if they belong to a “superior” race, then they are superior in every way to anyone of an “inferior” race. This is easily found to be untrue. Statistically, it may be possible to comment about an entire people, but such statistical assertions will have little to do with anyone as an individual, except to indicate the probability that anyone else will share some particular racial attribute. 

A trite example of this would be someone believing that because “white men can’t jump” that every black person could outjump me, a white man. Well, I don’t doubt that a vast majority of blacks can outjump me but I know from personal experience that not all of them can do so. The obvious conclusion is that there exists a range of gifts and capabilities within otherwise homogenous groups. Though today there are almost no truly homogenous or pure races. 

## A Different Perspective 

To illustrate a point, I’ve assumed six, relatively homogenous, hypothetical races and arranged them in a simple graph. The races each have different sized populations and those populations are differentially talented musically in relation to the other races. The vertical axis measures the upper and lower range of musical ability within each race. 

image here

I have placed a short-dash line in the middle of each race to indicate its average (mean) and used this measure to stipulate RACE 2 as the musically superior race because it had the highest musical average. Furthermore, a long- dash line has been placed to indicate my ability in relation to all of the races. It can be seen that, regardless of which race I personally belong to, the graph shows there will be people with musical talent both greater and lesser than my own. Other observations include:  
- RACE 3 and RACE 5 have persons’ superior to anyone in the superior RACE 2. 
- RACE 5 has the most superior and most inferior individuals of all the races. 
- The most inferior of RACE 2 is almost the average of the RACE 1. 
- Virtually half of RACE 3 is superior to the best of RACE 4. 
- About half of RACE 4 is superior to the lowest of RACE 3, a superior race. 
- Almost half of RACE 1 is inferior to the lowest of RACE 2. 
- RACE 5 and RACE 6 have essentially the same average, though RACE 5 is twice the size and monopolizes the extremes. 

To repeat, any attempt to draw parallels from such a graph must factor in the worldwide extent of race mixing. There are very few, if any, populations of even moderately pure races. 

In light of the above, invoking your race to establish your individual superiority, or another’s inferiority, seems essentially un-informative. Therefore, a guiding principle for individuals regarding the relationship between superior and inferior races could be stated: 

NO INDIVIDUAL can be considered SUPERIOR or INFERIOR based solely on Race  

## Is The Urantia Book Racist? 

The reaction of some is to pronounce The Urantia Book as racist because it uses terms such as superior and inferior when discussing race. But The Urantia Book is not racist, quite the contrary, though it purports a multiplicity of differentiated abilities to each race, it states quite clearly that all races have particular values that are intended to be biologically shared with all races once each individual race purged itself of its least worthy members. This was supposed to be accomplished 39,000 years ago but was not because of the earlier Dalmatia default. It left us in the difficult position of trying to remedy our racial situation today fairly, ethically, and morally without much guidance. 

> “Variety is indispensable to opportunity for the wide functioning of natural selection, differential survival of superior strains. Stronger and better races are to be had from the interbreeding of diverse peoples when these different races are carriers of superior inheritance factors.”_ [64:6.31] (P. 726) 

So, contrary to historical racist beliefs, T _he Urantia Book_ clearly states that there was always a plan to merge the races and not, as some still think, to keep them separate according to “god and the laws of nature”. 

## Why Are There Secondary Races? 

But there is still a question of why there were three primary and three secondary races were necessary. We were told that some planets had just three primary races? What was the point of the secondary races? Why were their races considered inferior while their attributes were considered of sufficient value to be later integrated with all races? 

In order to illustrate a point, I would like to arbitrarily assign different attributes to each of our previously mentioned six races. In this demonstration each individual races will be recognized as having the maximum expression of one particular attribute, even though all races will have some amount of every attribute. 

I imagine that the differences might in some ways be similar to Howard Gardner’s theory of multiple intelligences. However, the assignment of attributes below are not his nor strictly as found in the Urantia Papers, rather they are assigned by me in order to illustrate my argument. The attributes are allocated as follows: 

- Red race – intelligence, individualism 
- Blue race – tool making ability, adventurousness 
- Yellow race – strong communal & agricultural tendencies 
- Orange race – building & spatial ability 
- Green race – individual strength and size 
- Indigo race – advanced mind/body coordination 

Because races in the Urantia Papers are seemingly designated primary (superior) or secondary (inferior) based on their attributes, we need to consider what might make any particular attribute superior to another? Here are two questions that might help us begin a reevaluating process: 
- Primary: In establishing a civilization couldn’t Intelligence, Tool-Making, and a strong Communal Tendency be considered absolutely essential for success? Isn’t it likely these attributes would be considered more essential to civilization than might Individual Strength, Building Ability, and Mind/Body Coordination? 
- Secondary: And is it so hard to imagine that in the “flowering” of a rudimentary civilization, secondary attributes such as Athletics, Individual Strength, and Building Ability would be indispensable in advancing the quality of life and enhancing the potentials of any population? 

Even if you don’t agree with which three attributes are essential and which secondary, you have to agree that this is a respectful and valuing way to view the inter-dependent and indispensable relationship binding primary and secondary races. 

## Unfair To Secondary Races? 

So what about the seeming unfairness of being born into to a secondary race with its “inferior” status? Should these peoples be expected to happily bear the added burden of racial prejudice while trying to pursue a successful life? To the extent their situation is a consequence of Urantia’s general default, shouldn’t all individuals’ feel some obligation to assist those who are struggling due to no fault of their own? This is not suggesting “special rights” pity or charity, but rather an opportunity for each of us as individuals to manifest loving concern for our fellows. Fortunately, of some consolation, is the fact that people of secondary races can look with hope and pride to the Urantia Papers account of their eternal future. 

> In all this is shown the wisdom of the Creators. It would be just as easy for the Universal Father to make all mortals perfect beings, to impart perfection by his divine word. But that would deprive them of the wonderful experience of the adventure and training associated with the long and gradual inward climb, an experience to be had only by those who are so fortunate to begin at the very bottom of living existence. [32:3.11] (P. 361-2)

# A Tale of Two Men 

_By Linda Buselli, Carmel, IN_ 

_The following was presented as a plenary speech at the Summer Study Session 2015._ 

This is the story of two remarkable men who changed the world by sharing their experiences with faith. 

Have you ever heard of Brother Laurence? He was a quiet man who entered a monastery in France in 1666. He had no desire to become a priest or to advance in status in the monastery, so as a lay brother, he worked in the kitchens as a cook and dish washer. His entire being was concentrated on a _constant awareness_ of the presence of God, so much so that his writings about his experiences were treasured by all who knew him. After his death, at the urgings of a Cardinal of the Church, these letters and accounts of conversations with him were published under the title _The Practice of the Presence of God_ and have inspired untold millions of readers. This little book has been in constant print for almost 400 years, and is still considered a classic. 

What is so special about what Brother Laurence did? He seems to have reached a level of God-consciousness during virtually every moment of his day. In fact, he did what _The Urantia Book_ tells us Jesus did. He maintained a consciousness of God all day, every day, with a constant conversation with Him. He dedicated everything he did to God, and he went way beyond the prescribed prayers of his order. To quote Brother Laurence, 

> “Do you know the highest kind of life we can experience? There is not in the world a kind of life more sweet and delightful than that of a continual conversation with God. Those only can comprehend it who practice and experience it; let us do it from a principle of love, and because God would have us.” 

Brother Laurence’s writings are very simple compared to passages in The Urantia Book, but they have touched so many minds and hearts because his was a living experience of God’s presence in everything he did. Many of the things he said are not too different from some of the book’s statements. For instance from The Urantia Book : 

> Those who know God have experienced the fact of his presence, such knowing mortals hold in their personal experience the only positive proof of the existence of the living God which one human being can offer to another. The existence of God is utterly beyond all possibility of demonstration except for the contact between the God- consciousness of the human mind and the God-presence of the Thought Adjuster that indwells the mortal intellect and is bestowed upon man as the free gift of the Universal Fath er. [1:2.5]( P. 2 4) 

Note this difference of delivery from Brother Laurence: 

> “ Oh dear friend, the Lord is not outside of you, pouring down favors. The Lord is within you. Seek Him there, within...and nowhere else. ” 

Here is another comparison from The Urantia Book : 

> “ (Prayer) is a spontaneous outburst of God- consciousness .” [91:8.11] (P. 1002) 

And from Brother Laurence: “My prayers are nothing other than a sense of the presence of God”. 

Brother Laurence also said: “I am more united to God in my outward employments than when I leave them for devotion and retirement.” 

Compare that with this Urantia Book quote: “ The contact of the mortal mind with its indwelling Adjuster, while often favored by devoted meditation, is more frequently facilitated by wholehearted and loving service in unselfish ministry to one’s fellow creatures .” [91:7.1] (P. 1000) 

The Urantia Book tells us we will be known by our example of living the fruits of the spirit. Here is an observation of Brother Laurence written by someone who knew him: 

> “ As Brother Laurence found such an advantage in walking in the presence of God, it was natural for him to recommend it earnestly to others. But his example was a stronger inducement than any arguments he could ever have proposed. His very countenance was edifying, with such a sweet and calm devotion appearing to it as could not but affect his beholders. It was observed that in the greatest hurry of business in the kitchen, he still preserved his recollection and heavenly minded business. He did each thing with an even, uninterrupted composure and tranquility of spirit. “The time of business said he, does not differ with me from the time of prayer; and in the noise and clatter of my kitchen, while several persons are at the same time calling for different things, I possess God in as great a tranquility as if I were upon my knees at the blessed sacrament.”” 

For anyone interested in a more modern discussion of Brother Laurence’s spiritual journey, Frank Laubach, a Congregational Christian missionary in the mid-twentieth century, gives a detailed account of his attempts and successes in following in Brother Laurence’s footsteps. He served many years in the Philippines. It was during this time that he became known as “the Apostle of the Illiterate” because of his dedication to bringing literacy to the underprivileged. His efforts to accomplish this resulted in organizations around the world that exist today. He is the only American missionary to ever be honored on a U.S. postage stamp. 

He became inspired by Brother Laurence, and in his book _Practicing His Presence_, he gives an interesting account of his experiences in developing a constant consciousness of God. He has many suggestions for beginning the habit of holding a conversation with Him. Here is just a fraction of what he has to say: 

> “If you lean back to consider some problem, how can you remember the Lord? By forming a new habit. All thought employs silent words and is really conversation with your inner self. Instead of talking to yourself, form the habit of talking to Christ. Some of us who have done this find it so much better that we never want the other way again. ...He dwells in us, walks in our minds, reaches out through our hands, speaks with our voices, if we respond to His every whisper.” 

Many of his statements mirror some from The Urantia Book. For instance: 

> “If our destiny is to grow on and on and on, into some far more beautiful creatures than we are now,   that means that we need to have the shells broken quite frequently so that we can grow .” 

From The Urantia Book : 

Z No chick may be had without the shell, and no shell is of any worth after the chick is hatched. [48:6.32] (P. 554)   

Brother Laurence at one point indicates that a few of his associates thought he may be becoming too mystical with these exercises. Both men have been accused of being mystics, yet have functioned in their lives quite successfully and with great joy and faith. In fact, Brother Laurence laughed when accused of being a mystic. He said: “How can anyone who believes in Jesus not be a Mystic?” 

And Frank Laubach, who referred to himself as a “modern mystic” commented on it also. He said: “I am well aware of the probability of criticism because it is “mysticism”...or because many people think that the days of direct contact with God, or at least words from God, stopped with the closing of the New Testament.” 

Now, how can we follow the examples of these two men? In their books both men gained a mindedness of God’s presence, and both give details of the joy and peace that ensued. Frank Laubach has some suggestions a beginner might consider: 

“This is the best way to act: talk a great deal to the Lord. When reading, keep a running conversation with Him about the pages you are reading.” 

When you are strolling out of doors alone, you can recall the Lord at least once every minute with no effort. If you wander to a place where you can talk out loud without being overheard, you may speak to the invisible Companion inside you. 

I have found that we can establish ourselves in a sense of the presence of God by continually talking with Him.” 

At one point he had become discouraged with his efforts: 

“Oh, this thing of keeping in constant touch with God, of making Him the object of my thought I cannot do it even half of a day—not yet, but I believe I shall be doing it some day for the entire day. It is a matter of acquiring a new habit of thought. 

And later in his efforts: 

> “Usually, you will feel no deep emotion, but will always have a “peace that passeth all understanding.” Remember, this statement from _The Urantia Book_? “ _Genuine spiritual ecstasy is usually associated with great outward calmness and almost perfect emotional control._ ” [91”7.3] (P. 1000) 

After almost two years of constant effort, Frank Laubach made this entry in his diary: 

> “When one has struck some wonderful blessing that all mankind has a right to know about, no custom or false modesty should prevent him from telling it, even though it may mean the unbarring of his soul to the public gaze. 

This simple practice requires only a gentle pressure of the will, not more than a person can exert easily. It grows easier as the habit becomes fixed. 

Yet it transforms life into heaven. Everybody takes on a new richness, and all the world seems tinted with glory. I do not, of course, know what others think of me, but the joy which I have within cannot be described. If there were never other reward than that, it would more than justify the practice to me.” 

> Even to approach the knowing of a divine personality, all of man’s personality endowments must be wholly consecrated to the effort; half- hearted partial devotion will be unavailing. You can argue over opinions about God, but experience with him and in him exists above and beyond all human controversy and mere intellectual logic. [1:6.5] (P. 30) 

I have tried to come up with some suggestions based on personal experiences and those of friends. Here some definitions may be needed. For instance, meditation is generally understood to imply the silencing of thought so that the Adjuster can communicate with the individual. The process Brother Laurence and Frank Laubach suggest, rather than an emptying of the mind, is a conscious filling of the mind with the presence of God. Everyone defines meditation according to the way they personally express it, including conversation, so expectations vary among individuals. 

A friend of mine came up with a suggestion that was probably the best I’ve ever tried. For one day, I was asked to do the following with every person I met—to imagine the Father’s love moving through me to that individual. I was not to put in my own feelings or interpretations, merely to allow the Father’s love to use me as a conduit. In fact, I wasn’t supposed to think anything at all, just let the Father do everything. The results were amazing. If we can succeed in keeping this God-consciousness in us even most of the time, perhaps there would be no room for anything but love...no space for anger, unhealthy ego manifestations, the inability to forgive, or unhappiness. 

Each of us is so unique that we have to develop practices that work for us. For a more complete list of possibilities, I would suggest Frank Laubach’s book, Practicing His Presence. In it he has combined Brother Laurence’s complete book with a description of his own attempts and failures in his development of this sense of the divine presence. You will find many more suggestions for beginning a new and deeper experience of the presence of God. 

Finally, the following was written by Brother Laurence shortly before he died: 

> “In a little time I will go to God. What comforts me in this life is that I now see my Lord by faith. In seeing Him by faith I actually see so well I sometimes say, ‘I believe no more! I see!” 

I can feel that which faith teaches; I can sense what faith sees. This of course, works great assurance in me. In that assurance, and in that practice of faith, I will live and die with Him.”

# Akhenaten 

_By Derek Samaras, Denver, CO_ 

Akhenaten (Ikhnaton) 

> Never in all history did any king so methodically proceed to swing a whole nation from polytheism to monotheism as did this extraordinary Ikhnaton. [95:5.4] (P. 1047) 

image Berlin’s Neues Museum, Akhenaten’s bust bears the scars of upheavals ancient and modern. Smashed by the king’s successors in the 14th century B.C 

Akhenaten, the son of AmenhotepIII was the young king of Egypt who ruled from around 1353 B.C. until 1336 B.C. and might be considered a revolutionary by today’s standards. During his short reign he successfully changed his name, relocated the capitol of Egypt from Thebes to a newly built Amarna, and united his people under monotheism. His writings were prolific as some are now immortalized in the Old Testament under Hebrew authorship. Akhenaten’s only problem was that his new religion based on morality and righteousness under one God was too much for most people to grasp at the time. When his short reign was over, there was an immediate reversion back to the old ways of worshiping Isis and Osiris. All of Akhenaten’s writings were subsequently destroyed, and his name has ever since been the subject of many speculations and wild tales by professional Egyptologists, Theologians, and Alien theorists. 

> Ikhnaton was wise enough to maintain the outward worship of Aton, the sun-god, while he led his associates in the disguised worship of the One God, creator of Aton and supreme Father of all. This young teacher-king was a prolific writer, being author of the exposition entitled “The One God,” a book of thirty-one chapters, which the priests, when returned to power, utterly destroyed. Ikhnaton also wrote one hundred and thirty-seven hymns, twelve of which are now preserved in the Old Testament Book of Psalms, credited to Hebrew authorship. [95:5.7] (P. 1048)   

image A limestone stela at the Neues Museum features Akhenaten and Nefertiti with three of their daughters beneath the sun god Aten.  

 Akhenaten is most popular for his installment of the worship of Aten(Aton) the “Solar Disk” or Sun god. The worship of one deity marks a great social and religious evolution for a family, nation, or race. Monotheism is a powerful unifier for a society. There was however 2 sides to the worship of Aten. 
 
> Very wisely Ikhnaton sought to establish monotheism under the guise of the sun-god. This decision to approach the worship of the Universal Father by absorbing all gods into the worship of the sun was due to the counsel of the *Salemite physician. Ikhnaton took the generalized doctrines of the then existent Aton faith regarding the fatherhood and motherhood of Deity and created a religion which recognized an intimate worshipful relation between man and God._ [95:5.6] (PP. 1047-48) 

# Salemite Physician Who Taught Akhenaten Monotheism? 

In a recent article published by _National Geographic_, Ray Johnson, who directs the Chicago House, the University of Chicago’s research center in Luxor mentions a peculiar detail that might possibly be a reference to the “salemite physician.” 

Johnson has recently pieced together broken wall reliefs and statuary from collections scattered all around the world. Digitization makes work like this faster. Johnson showed me a virtual “join” in which he had matched a photograph of one fragment located in Copenhagen with another in the Metropolitan Museum of Art. “They’re 4,000 miles apart, but I realized that they join,” he said. The connection reveals a surprising scene: Akhenaten performs a ritual not with Nefertiti, but with *Kiya, another wife, who didn’t have the status of queen.

Certainly its speculation to assume that Kiya is the missing salemite physician who taught Akhenaten monotheism but it is interesting how The Urantia Book tells us that this salemite physician was also a woman and none other than the mother of Akhenaton. 

> The teachings of Amenemope were slowly losing their hold on the Egyptian mind when, through the influence of an Egyptian Salemite physician, a woman of the royal family espoused the Melchizedek teachings. This woman prevailed upon her son, Ikhnaton, Pharaoh of Egypt, to accept these doctrines of One God. [95:5.1] (P. 1047) 

This passage in _The Urantia Book_ doesn’t tell us the name of the salemite physician but it does show that this woman would be considered very important to Akhenaten. Egyptologists have come to show that Tiye was the mother of Akhenaten, and while there is no mention of her being a physician, there is record of her having great influence as an advisor to Akhenaton during his rule at Amarna. Wikipedia tells us that she most likely was of foreign descent which could contribute to her having salem influences. 

[Egyptologists have suggested that Tiye’s father, Yuya, was of foreign origin due to the features of his mummy and the many different spellings of his name, which might imply it was a non-Egyptian name in origin.[^4] Some suggest that the queen’s strong political and unconventional religious views might have been due not just to a strong character, but to foreign descent.] 

It turned out that Akhenaton needed all the advising he could get from his mother because his ambition was not equaled by his sagaciousness. His new religion deemed too much, too quickly for the majority of citizens. It was difficult for them to leave the old ways that were so steeped in ritual, superstition, and nature worship. 

> The weakness of Ikhnaton’s doctrine lay in the fact that he proposed such an advanced religion that only the educated Egyptians could fully comprehend his teachings. The rank and file of the agricultural laborers never really grasped his gospel and were, therefore, ready to return with the priests to the old- time worship of Isis and her consort Osiris, who was supposed to have been miraculously resurrected from a cruel death at the hands of Set, the god of darkness and evil. [95:5.12] (P. 1048) 

Even though the ideal of monotheism experienced a decline with the passing of Akhenaten’s reign, the idea of one God persisted in the thinking of many people. Akhenaten’s son in law, Tutankhamen decided to join the priests of the old religious ways. In ironic fashion he took a page from his father’s book and changed his name and moved the capital back to Thebes. Unfortunately much of the art and literature at Amarna was destroyed and all associations with Akhenaten were severed. 

Ray Johnson from the University of Chicago’s research center in Luxor comments on the remarkable art and craftsmanship present in the objects found at Amarna, but also explains the intentional destruction and separation of all associations with Akhenaten. Even by his family. 

“This is beautifully made,” he said, holding up the piece of carved stone statuary, on which only the king’s lower legs were visible. “This is not accidentally damaged.” Amarna archaeology has a forensic quality because so many artifacts were deliberately destroyed after the sudden death of the king around 1336 B.C. His only son and heir was Tutankhaten, no more than 10 years old, who soon replaced the “Aten” in his name with the title of the god that his father had hated: Tutankhamun. He abandoned Amarna and returned to the old traditions.” http://www.nationalgeographic.com/magazine/2017/05/akhenaten-revolutionary-egypt-king/  

image At the Luxor Museum, his features appear on one of the few sculptures whose face was not smashed. Discovered beneath a temple at Karnak, this artifact appears to have been buried at the command of the king himself, who repeatedly changed the style of his portrayal, discarding previous versions. 

Most scholars currently don’t describe Akhenaten as a monotheist due to their concern of too many modern characteristics being ascribed to Akhenaten. Equally, the secular world of academia tends to tread lightly when the word Religion is introduced, due to its precarious associations with many traditions. 

Love him or hate him, Akhenaten has contributed to the moral, social, and spiritual foundation of the entire judeo-christian perspective with his interpretation of the One God of all. It remains a mystery to professionals as to why his works were so vehemently destroyed immediately after his death. 

> Ikhnaton was wise enough to maintain the outward worship of Aton, the sun-god, while he led his associates in the disguised worship of the One God, creator of Aton and supreme Father of all. This young teacher-king was a prolific writer, being author of the exposition entitled “The One God,” a book of thirty-one chapters, which the priests, when returned to power, utterly destroyed. Ikhnaton also wrote one hundred and thirty-seven hymns, twelve of which are now preserved in the Old Testament Book of Psalms, credited to Hebrew authorship. [95:5.7] (P. 1048) 

Finding support for Akhenaten’s writings within the Bible are difficult for multiple reasons. The first being, the priests immediately destroyed his works following his death, and has influenced the academic professionals on the marjority to interpret Aknenaten as more of a villain character. This is due to his “breaking old traditions.” This paints an unfortunate representation of the gifted, spiritually revolutionary king. Second, It’s important to point out that Akhenaten was teaching from the wisdom and writings of Amenemope, who scholars are now quietly attributing some verses of the old testament to. There is still great effort in keeping a strictly traditional Hebrew ownership and accredidation for the authorship of the Old testament, as well as the creation of monotheism. This becomes a challenge when trying to discern and share historical truths for archeologists and historians. There is an old book by James Breasted called “The Dawn of Conscience” 1933, in it he points out the exact passages where the teachings of Amenemope appear in the old testament. 

“The Dawn of Conscience”

Amenemope’s wise teachings are located at the British museum. 

I’ve selected a few of my favorite passages from the book of Proverbs and a bit of the 1Psalm, which contains the teachings originally written by (Amen)emope and was the heart of Akhenaten’s teachings:

# The New Teacher/Leaders 

A training manual

_By Preston Thomas, Earlysville, VA_ 

Note: Appendix notes refer to Preston Thomas’ Book The Life and Teachings of Jesus  

## Our Call 

There are many hopeful and inspiring statements about our future in _The Urantia Book_, but few can match the promise and opportunity that is foretold in the following lines: 

> Religion does need new leaders, spiritual men and women who will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings. [19:9.3] (P. 2082) 
> 
> ...the spiritual renaissance must await the coming of these new teachers of Jesus’ religion who will be exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men._ [19:9.3] (P. 2082) 

Let us reflect upon the amazing implications of these statements. The revelators are telling us that our world is in need of new teachers of Jesus’ religion. And they are prophesying the coming of these new teachers, predicting that these new religious leaders will help bring a spiritual renaissance to our “dark and confused world.” 

(See Appendix 1.1 To Whom Is This Great Call Directed?) 

In many places the revelators point out that today’s world is beset by serious problems. The greatest of these are materialistic secularism, unceasing social transformation, and spiritual stagnation. New religious leaders are desperately needed to answer these problems by turning our world back to the true religion of Jesus. 

(See Appendix 1.2 Our Present Situation: World Crisis and the Need for Spiritual Religion) 

Yes, we do face serious problems, but great things lie ahead, and we are called to participate! We are called to join in a great adventure! Here is how the revelators describe what is to happen on our world and the thrilling possibilities that lie in our future: 

> The call to the adventure of building a new and transformed human society by means of the spiritual rebirth of Jesus’ brotherhood of the kingdom should thrill all who believe in him as men have not been stirred since the days when they walked about on earth as his companions in the flesh. [195:10.6](P. 2084); (my bold) 

The time for a new revelation of Jesus has come! The leaders of this new revelation will bring about the spiritual rebirth of Jesus’ brotherhood of the kingdom. They will spark a great new spiritual renaissance. For those who feel inclined to help bring about this new revelation, three fundamental requirements are set forth.  

## The Three Fundamental Requirements 

The new teacher-leaders must: 
1. be “spiritual men and women” 
2. “be exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men” 
3. “dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings”   

If we seek membership in this now forming corps of new teacher-leaders it is good to reflect upon each of these requirements. We will find that, just as the task is great, so also are the requirements. What follows may be thought of as a guide and basic training manual for those who aspire to become new teacher-leaders. As we ponder what role we might play in this great adventure let us be mindful what Jesus requires of his followers: 

> In accordance with the truth committed to your hands will the Master of truth demand a reckoning. [176:3.8](P. 1918)  

## The Spirituality Requirement 

The first and most basic requirement for the new teacher-leaders is that they be “spiritual men and women.” What does it mean to be “spiritual”? 

Spirituality is a reflection of our closeness to God; it is the measure of our attunement to his indwelling spirit. It is directly proportional to the elimination of the selfish qualities of love. And crucially, it is also a measure of the effectiveness of our spiritual ministry. Here is how the revelators put it: _Spirituality becomes at once the indicator of one’s nearness to God and the_ **_measure of one’s usefulness to fellow beings_**_._ [100:2.4] (P. 1096)(my bold) 

### The Birth Of The Spirit 

The essential first step to becoming a spiritual person is to be “born of the spirit.” What is the “birth of the spirit”? 

The “birth of the spirit” is the change of mind that occurs when we wholeheartedly choose to do the Father’s will. When we make this choice his indwelling spirit is born into the light of our faith. Jesus explained it to Nicodemus this way: 

> Already does this spirit of the Father in heaven indwell you. If you would be led by this spirit from above, very soon would you begin to see with the eyes of the spirit, and then by the wholehearted choice of spirit guidance would you be born of the spirit since your only purpose in living would be to do the will of your Father who is in heaven. [142:6.7] (P. 1602) 

It is important to realize that the birth of the spirit is a gradual process and is mostly unconscious. When the process is complete it culminates in a “birthday.” Here is how the revelators describe it: 

> Religion is functional in the human mind and has been realized in experience prior to its appearance in human consciousness. A child has been in existence about nine months before it experiences birth. But the “birth” of religion is not sudden; it is rather a gradual emergence. Nevertheless, sooner or later there is a “birth day”. [103:2.1] (P.1130) 

### Showing Forth the Fruits of the Spirit 

Since the birth of the spirit is a gradual process that is mostly unconscious, how may we know if we have been born of the spirit? Put simply, if we are born of the spirit we will begin to show forth the fruits of the spirit in our daily lives. Here is what Jesus said: 

> ...those who are born of the spirit will immediately begin to show forth the fruits of the spirit in loving service to their fellow creatures. [193:2.2] (P. 2054) 

> But be not deceived; while salvation is the free gift of God and is bestowed upon all who accept it by faith, there follows the experience of bearing the fruits of this spirit life as it is lived in the flesh._ [193:1.2] (P.2053) _If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead. [193:2.2] (P. 2054) 

We must also realize that the Father requires of his faithful followers not only that they bear the fruits of the spirit, but that they grow and progress in spiritual fruit bearing. As we continue in the Father’s will we must increasingly show forth spiritual fruit in our personal lives. Here is how Jesus put it: 

> Increasingly must you yield the fruit of the spirit as you progress heavenward in the kingdom of God. [193:2.2] ( P. 2 0 5 4) 

> My Father requires of the children of faith that they bear much spiritual fruit. [193:2.2] (P. 2054)   

### What Are the Fruits of the Spirit? 

What are the fruits of the spirit? Basically they are the character traits that result from our connection with God’s indwelling spirit. They are the characteristics of the Spirit that flows through us and we exhibit in our life reactions. The domination of a human life by the Father’s spirit is always accompanied by a growth in these perfections of character. Following is a listing of some of the fruits of the spirit. The first list we are familiar with from the Bible: 

> ...the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, long- suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance. [34:6.13] (P. 381) 

Jesus presented a second list at one of his last appearances: 

> And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. [193:2.2] (P. 2054) 

In fact, the fruits of the spirit are basically the character traits that Jesus demonstrated in his perfected life on earth. 

> When man yields the “fruits of the spirit” in his life, he is simply showing forth the traits which the Master manifested in his own earthly life. [194:3.1] (P. 2062) 

So our first job is to be born of the spirit, but this spirit birth must be immediately followed by spiritual fruit bearing. We must increasingly and spontaneously bear this spiritual fruit throughout our lives. This is our ever-present goal and the measure of our spiritual progress. As we go through life we may inquire of ourselves, “Am I increasingly showing forth the fruits of the spirit in my daily life?” If we are, we may be confident that we are advancing in the required spiritual training to become an effective teacher-leader. And in this long spiritual journey it is good to remind ourselves that: 

> The quickest way for a tadpole to become a frog is to live loyally each day a tadpole. [100:1.4] (P. 1094)  

### Growing Up to Spiritual Adulthood 

We cannot stand still in the kingdom. We must go forward, and the culminating result of such growth and advancement is spiritual adulthood and maturity. As new teacher-leaders we must understand that to effectively reveal Jesus we will have to reach spiritual adulthood. We are called to be living examples of the mature spirituality that may be attained by a true follower of Jesus. Here is what he taught about growing up to spiritual adulthood and maturity: 

> You may enter the kingdom as a child, but_ **_the Father requires that you grow up, by grace, to the full stature of spiritual adulthood_**. [193:2.2] (P. 2054) (my bold) 

> Childlike trust secures man’s entrance into the kingdom of heavenly ascent, but progress is wholly dependent on the vigorous exercise of the_ **_robust and confident faith of the full- grown man_**. [102:1.1] (P. 1118) (my bold) 

> Though Jesus taught that faith, simple childlike belief, is the key to the door of the kingdom, he also taught that, having entered the door, there are progressive steps of righteousness which every believing child must ascend in order to_ **_grow up to the full stature of the robust sons of God_**. [170:3.2] (P. 1861) (my bold) 

(See Appendix 1.3 Four Step Progression to Spiritual Adulthood) 

### Jesus Lives Again in Us 

Spiritual adulthood and maturity qualifies us to progress to an even higher state of spirituality. This is the level wherein Jesus, through his indwelling spirit of Truth, is enabled to live again in us. The most successful teacher- leaders will reach this exalted state. This will make them truly effective representatives and ministers of Jesus. It is this level of spirituality that the revelators call for: 

> **_The world needs to see Jesus living again on earth in the experience of spirit-born mortals_** who effectively reveal the Master to all men. [195:10.1] (P. 2084; (my bold) 

The new teacher-leaders are called to attain that level of spirituality such that their lives naturally reflect Jesus and his inner spirit. Just as Jesus provided a living demonstration of his religion to his day and age, so are we called to be the living demonstrations of Jesus and his teachings to our modern world. We must be spirit-filled such that when others see us they may see Jesus! 

(See Appendix 1.4 Jesus Lives Again in Us) 

(See Appendix 1.5 Summary of the Spirituality Requirement) 

For further study and contemplation to guide us in attaining the requisite spirituality the following are highly recommended: 

(See Appendix 2 “Meditation in The Urantia Book ” by Peter Holly) 

Paper 100 Religion in Human Experience. The Urantia Book  

> **Sample Prayers:**
> 
> “May I increasingly show forth the fruit of the spirit in my daily life.” 
> “Jesus, live again in me.” 
> “Jesus, fill me with your spirit.” 
> “Jesus, shine through me.”  

## The Spiritual Regeneration Requirement 

The second major requirement we will consider is the directive that we be “exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men.” Notice that this directive gives us a clear and well-defined goal, the “spiritual regeneration” of others. This is the specific and exclusive work we are called to, and it gives focus and power to our efforts.   

### First, Be Spiritually Regenerated Ourselves 

If we truly seek to be a force for spiritual regeneration in others we should recognize that to be most effective we must be spiritually regenerated ourselves. Only after having been born of the spirit and having achieved a sufficient measure of spiritual advancement, are we are rightly prepared to effect spiritual regeneration in others.   

### Spiritual Regeneration Of Others Through Personal Contact 

We must realize that our greatest power to spark spiritual regeneration will come not through our teachings, but rather through the contact of others with our spirit- filled presence. It is the example of our spirit-dominated life, especially in the midst of our secular and materialistic world, that will be most effective in inspiring spiritual regeneration in others.   

### Why Exclusively Devoted To Spiritual Regeneration? 

We should also note that we are called to be exclusively devoted to spiritual regeneration. Why exclusively? Here is the context in which we find the exclusivity requirement: 

> If Christianity persists in neglecting its spiritual mission while it continues to busy itself with social and material problems, the spiritual renaissance must await the coming of these new teachers of Jesus’ religion who will be exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men. [195:9.4](P. 2082) 

Thus we see that the reason for exclusively devoting ourselves to spiritual regeneration derives from the fact that Christianity has increasingly neglected its spiritual mission and substituted a focus on social and material problems. Professed followers of Jesus have become diverted from his commission to _“effect the spiritual transformation of successive generations of mankind .”_ [195:9.10] (P. 2083) 

We are to avoid the mistake of Christianity. We must not be distracted and diverted from our work; we are called to an exclusively spiritual mission. As new teacher-leaders we must focus our efforts on this one clear goal—the spiritual regeneration of our fellow man. 

### Working for Spiritual Regeneration 

So how do we go about working for spiritual regeneration? 

We may take our first step by simply choosing to work for this goal. We can make it a conscious practice in our everyday life. It involves a new way of looking at others and a new way of interacting with them. It is to see them, not through the lens of our differences, but rather as fellow children of God whom we seek to advance spiritually. 

We add power to our efforts by praying that we may be a force for spiritual regeneration in others. We may pray that Jesus live again in us and that he work through us to spiritually inspire and uplift those we contact. Here is the ideal the revelators call us to live up to: 

> Jesus’ disciples should be more than conquerors, even overflowing sources of inspiration and enhanced living to all men. [195:10.] (P. 2084) 

## The Requirement to Depend Solely on Jesus 

> _The last major requirement we will consider is the directive that we “dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings .”_ 

(See Appendix 1.6 The Need for Courage) 

### Why the Exclusivity Requirement? 

Let us consider the exclusivity requirement. Why are we called to depend solely on Jesus and his teachings? Why not, for example, depend on the best of Christianity, which _The Urantia Book_ calls “the best of the religions of the twentieth century?” Or why not depend on a synthesis of the greatest teachings of all the world’s religions? 

### Distinguish the Religion of Jesus from the Religion about Jesus 

There are three especially important reasons for this directive. The first reason derives from the fact that the world knows Jesus only through the lens of Christianity. Most people do not have any idea that there is a religion of Jesus that is separate and apart from Christianity, which has evolved as a religion about Jesus. His original gospel has been submerged within the overall Christian message. And the true teachings of Jesus are identified with many non- Jesusonian teachings. 

Further, Christianity early on began the process of applying all of Jesus’ teachings regarding his spiritual kingdom to the temporal Christian church. To enter the kingdom, to be born of the spirit and dedicate oneself to doing the Father’s will, was equated to being baptized into the church. Thus an outward social organization was substituted for Jesus concept of an inner spiritual kingdom. For these and other reasons Jesus’ teachings must be clearly distinguished from the Christian message. Our work is to focus on and exalt the teachings of Jesus. 

(See Appendix 1.7 The Substitution Error)   

### Jesus’ Incomparable Teachings 

A clue to the second reason for depending solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings is contained within the directive itself. His teachings are indeed incomparable. They are the highest and greatest and most truly valuable teachings ever to appear on planet earth. They are divine and perfect. All other teachings may be judged by their compatibility with the teachings of Jesus. He is our touchstone to truth.   

### The Valueo of Jesus’ Life Demonstrating his Teachings 

His teachings are best understood by observing the perfected life he lived on earth. The perfection of personality and character he developed in living a trying and testing earth life provides an ideal example for us to emulate in our own lives. Jesus life is so valuable because it is not just a theoretical construct of an ideal moral philosophy, but rather a living demonstration of the spiritual character he taught. This combination of teaching the ideal character and then providing a real life example of that character is our most valuable knowledge. 

> Of all human knowledge that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it. [196:1.3] (P. 2090) 

(See Appendix 1.8 The Living Jesus)  

### Only Jesus and his Teachings Possess the Power to Triumph over the Modern Threats to Civilization and Bring the Spiritual Renaissance 

The third reason for the exclusivity requirement is the fact that only Jesus and his incomparable teachings possess the power to bring about the spiritual renaissance. _The Urantia Book_ tells us that Christianity _“has truly been one of the greatest powers for good on the earth”_ [195:10.12] (P. 2085). It has done its job carrying the kingdom of Jesus’ concept forward for 2000 years, up to and through our present material and secular age. But now more is needed. Only Jesus and his personal religion possess the power to see us through the three great problems that our world now faces: spiritual non-progression, materialistic secularism, and unceasing social change. Only Jesus and his teachings possess the power to stabilize us in this time of crisis and triumph over these modern threats to civilization. Only through Jesus and his teachings will we attain the new spiritual renaissance. Here is how the revelators put it: 

> Christianity has indeed done a great service to this world but_ **_what is now most needed is Jesus_**. [195:10.1] (P. 2084; my bold) 

(See Appendix 1.9 Summary of Reasons for the Exclusivity Requirement) 

## How Do We Work For The Spiritual Renaissance While Depending Solely On Jesus? 

We have discussed several reasons for depending solely on Jesus. Now let us turn to another related question. How? How do we go about the prosecution of our task to bring about a spiritual renaissance, all the while depending solely on Jesus and his teachings? 

(See Appendix 1.10 Learn, Live, and Teach the Way of Jesus) 

### Pray and Commune 

Depending on Jesus begins with our inner life. We must consistently look to Jesus within for help and guidance both in our personal lives and in our ministry. 

Jesus said, _“I am the vine, you are the branches .”_ This is a wonderful idea to meditate on. Remember also his teaching to “abide in me” and “live in my love.” He urges us to _“commune freely with me” and to “maintain this living spiritual connection with me .”_ [180:2.1] (P. 1945) These teachings, when followed, strengthen our inner life and our ministry. In my experience the idea that we can maintain a spiritual connection with Jesus is quite powerful. 

### The Spirit of Truth is Our Partner and Guide 

It should be clear that a revival of the actual teachings of Jesus that displaces the Christian teachings about Jesus is a gigantic task, and will not be easy. However, we may take solace and encouragement from the fact that our efforts to reveal Jesus will not be solitary. We are not undertaking this great work alone. The Spirit of Truth will be our full partner, in fact our guiding partner, in this great enterprise. The fact that Jesus’ Spirit of Truth was poured out upon us at Pentecost means that we are specially equipped to achieve our mission. In fact, our new revelation of Jesus’ life and teachings is really a part of the ongoing mission of the Spirit of Truth to reveal Jesus to each new generation of mortals on earth. Here is what the revelators tell us: 

> ...the Spirit of Truth came to help the believer to witness to the realities of Jesus’ teachings and his life as he lived it in the flesh.... [194:2.6] (P. 2061) (my bold) 

> This spirit was bestowed for the purpose of qualifying believers more effectively to preach the gospel of the kingdom ... [194:3.5] (P. 2063) (my bold) 

We should always remember and be strengthened by the fact that our revelation of Jesus will be accomplished in partnership with his Spirit of Truth working in and through us. We are not fighting alone, but rather in partnership with the God of the universe. Jesus’ spirit will help and guide us. Our part is to maintain our spiritual connection with him and grow ever more receptive to his spiritual guidance. 

(See Appendix 1.11 Spiritual Weapons)   

### Focus on the Best of The Bible, Jesus Actual Life and Teachings 

In seeking a revival of the actual teachings of Jesus we must keep in mind that the world knows Jesus only through the Bible and Christianity. As much as we might wish otherwise, the spiritual revival of Jesus and his actual teachings is not going to happen through a widespread acknowledgement of the truth of The Urantia Book. The worldwide acceptance of a 2000 page book that presents itself as a new revelation of truth will take tine, and will really come to pass only after the present world crisis is behind us and we have entered the new spiritual renaissance. I believe that The Urantia Book will be the Bible of this oncoming new age; it will be like a third testament that will guide us in the more spiritual age that is to follow our present material age. 

This means that we cannot justify our teaching of Jesus by reference to The Urantia Book. We must use the resources that are at hand, and our first and most  

basic resource is the record of the life and teachings of Jesus as found in the New Testament gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These records, sparse as they are in comparison to the Urantia Papers, are our most basic resource. Besides the New Testament gospels we have two other very important resources that will compliment our usage of the Biblical record. First, we have _The Urantia Book_ to deepen and broaden our understanding of Scripture, correct errors, and clear up misinterpretations. Second, we have Jesus’ indwelling spirit to both guide us and aid our ministry, and to work in others, to aid their understanding and acceptance of our teaching. 

### A New Resource: The Life and Teachings of Jesus 

Today I am happy to announce that there is another significant resource available to us. I am referring to this book, _The Life and Teachings of Jesus_, which I first published in 1991. It was created as a resource for those who seek to teach Jesus in the exclusive manner mandated by the revelators. I began work on this book in the early 80’s. My goal was to produce an acceptable and trustworthy source of truth that I could give to others for guidance, comfort, and inspiration. 

The basic idea for the book was to take all the true verses regarding Jesus from the Bible and put them together in their proper sequence based on the chronology of _The Urantia Book_. Erroneous passages, such as the virgin birth or walking on water, were simply left out. The goal was to produce a book of Jesus’ life and teachings that would be fully acceptable to most Christians and at the same time be fully harmonious with the teachings of _The Urantia Book_. My first use of the book was at graduation ceremonies at a small school I founded many years ago. At these ceremonies I presented each departing student with a copy of the book, and I am happy to report that it was always well received. More recently the book has been given at graduation ceremonies at a small seminary in Texas. Also a number of readers have reported that they have successfully used the book to teach Sunday school. In India a group of some 30 pastors has used it for years to guide their ministry. It has even been translated into Telegu, their native language, for wider distribution. This group of Christian pastors uses both the Bible and The Life and Teachings in their services. 

I do believe this book can be a valuable tool in our efforts to expand the revelation of Jesus. It provides us with a restatement of Jesus’ life and teachings that is wholly constructed from Biblical passages, while at the same time it is free from the misinterpretations, errors, 

and false doctrines, generally associated with the Bible and Christianity. These words from the gospels are recognized and honored by Christians all over the world and by many others as well. In fact, the pure life and teachings of Jesus, freed from the surrounding Christian teachings and dogma, should also prove acceptable both to non-believers and to those of other faiths. The book itself is always well received as a gift, thereby providing an acceptable and trustworthy revelation of Jesus that we can leave with others for guidance, comfort, and inspiration. It is an easy way to transmit the true teachings of Jesus, here and now.  

## The Future 

What does our future hold? What will be the results of our efforts? Following is an outline of how I believe our mission will unfold.   

### Our Target Audience is the Christian World 

As we dedicate ourselves to this undertaking it is instructive to first consider our target audience, those who will be most receptive to our new message of Jesus. Here we should clearly realize that our work must be directed primarily to the Christian world. After all it is with Christians that we have the greatest affinity and shared beliefs, both moral and spiritual. It is Christianity that recognizes and teaches Jesus as both the Son of God and the Son of man. It is also Christianity that stands in desperate need of new contact with Jesus and of deliverance from its error of emphasizing teachings about Jesus to the detriment of the actual teachings of Jesus. And crucially, it is the Christian church that contains within itself the actual kingdom of Jesus’ teaching—the divine brotherhood of believers who have chosen to do the Father’s will. Here is how the revelators describe the situation:   

### Jesus’ Kingdom Presently Exists Within the Christian Church 

> Thus does the so-called Christian church become the cocoon in which the kingdom of Jesus’ concept now slumbers. The kingdom of the divine brotherhood is still alive and will eventually and certainly come forth from this long submergence, just as surely as the butterfly eventually emerges as the beautiful unfolding of its less attractive creature of metamorphic development. [170:5.21] (P. 1866) (my bold) 

We may learn much from these words; they contain three important insights: First, the revelators make clear that Jesus’ brotherhood of the kingdom presently exists within the Christian church. Second, they reveal that this divine brotherhood is in a passive state, slumbering and submerged within Christianity. And third, they prophesy that this brotherhood will eventually awaken and come forth in a higher and more advanced form. 

### Focus On Awakening Slumbering Christian Believers 

This prophecy points to a special focus for our efforts. This slumbering brotherhood presently stands in need of awakening and spiritual rebirth. It is we who are called to provide a new revelation of Jesus that will awaken these sleeping Christians to higher levels of spiritual living. Bringing about the spiritual rebirth of Jesus’ brotherhood of the kingdom will be our first major step in the initiation of the spiritual renaissance. Here again is the revelators’ call: 

> The **call** to the adventure of building a new and transformed human society by means of **_the spiritual rebirth of Jesus’ brotherhood of the kingdom_** should thrill all who believe in him .... [195:10.6] (P. 2084) (my bold) 

### Unified Christians Will Help Bring The New Revelation to the World 

The Christian world is presently divided into many denominations, sects, and cults. The only hope of a unification of Christianity lies in a return to Jesus’ original gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of man. This is also part of our work. By our exclusive focus on Jesus’ actual teachings we will supply the foundation for the unification of the various Christian churches. And as this revival of Jesus and his original gospel comes to Christianity, many believers will then join our efforts to bring this gospel to the world at large. According to _The Urantia Book_ this is the great hope of our world: 

> **_The great hope of Urantia_** lies in the possibility of a new revelation of Jesus with a new and enlarged presentation of his saving message which would spiritually unite in loving service the numerous families of his present day professed followers. [195:10.15] (P. 2086) (my bold) 

### The Gospel Of The Kingdom

What is this “saving message” that would spiritually unite the various Christian cults? It is Jesus’ original gospel of the kingdom, the good news that we are all sons and daughters of God, our loving heavenly Father, and brothers and sisters to one another. It is this simple gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of man that has the power to unite Christianity. 

The kingdom Jesus taught is the Father’s will dominant and transcendent in the heart of the believer. We enter the kingdom by faith in Jesus’ teaching that God is our Father, and then by choosing to do our Father’s will. Jesus showed us the way to life in the kingdom with his two great prayers, “your will be done,” and “Not my will but yours be done.” 

In his first appearance after the crucifixion Jesus made clear to his assembled followers that, “Sonship with God by faith is still the saving truth of the gospel of the kingdom .” [193:0.4] (P. 2052) He emphasized that what the world needs most to know is that we are all sons and daughters of God and through faith we may actually realize and daily experience this great truth. In our work we must always teach others to see themselves as sons and daughters of God, our loving heavenly Father.   

### The Success Of Our Mission 

Will our efforts succeed? Consider these prophetic statements from the revelators that outline both the history and future evolution of the religion of Jesus on our planet: 

> The teachings of Jesus, even though greatly modified, survived the mystery cults of their birth time, the ignorance and superstition of the dark ages, and are even now slowly triumphing over the materialism, mechanism, and secularism of the twentieth century. [195:9.3] (P. 2082) (my bold) 
> 
> [The Christian] church is only the larval stage of the thwarted spiritual kingdom, which will carry it through this material age and over into a more spiritual dispensation where the Master’s teachings may enjoy a fuller opportunity for development. [170:5.21] (P. 1866) (my bold)   

The following quotes are two of my favorites. They foretell victory over the powerful forces of materialism and secularism, and a wonderful new spiritual age to follow: 

> A new and fuller revelation of the religion of Jesus is destined to conquer an empire of materialistic secularism and to overthrow a world sway of mechanistic naturalism. [195:9.2] (P. 2082) (my bold) 
> 
> Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment. [195:9.2 (P. 2082) (my bold)  

## Let Us Go Forward 

So, let us go forward! We have our marching orders and the encouraging vision of our final triumph. We are to bring a new revelation of Jesus to our world, one that will undo the teachings about Jesus and replace them with the actual teachings of Jesus. Our work will spark a glorious new spiritual renaissance. We will awaken slumbering Christian believers to a more inspiring vision of Jesus and a deeper, clearer understanding of his original gospel. These newly awakened Christians will join our efforts to expand the true religion of Jesus to both the Christian and the non-Christian worlds. 

This revival of Jesus’ original gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man will also help to unite the various Christian churches. And a more unified Christianity will contribute to the worldwide acceptance of Jesus and his actual teachings. The religion of Jesus will eventually triumph and become the dominant world religion in the new and more spiritual age we are now approaching. 

The requirements to be an effective teacher-leader are great and not all will attain the high level of spirituality required. However each person may participate in their own way up to the level they choose. Just as there were various levels of devotion in Jesus’ followers, so there will be various levels of participation by those who work for the new revelation. In large or small ways all may contribute to the coming triumph of the true religion of Jesus. For example, one easy and effective way to advance Jesus and his original teachings is to present _The Life and Teachings_ of Jesus as a gift to family, friends, and to those in distress. I have done this for years with great success and genuine appreciation from those who received the book. 

For those of you who truly feel this call to become a new teacher-leader, the first step is simple. You may enlist now by whole-heartedly affirming this choice to your Father within. Choose it, affirm it to God, and pray for his guidance and blessing. 

Your initial training will focus on the first great requirement of becoming “spiritual men and women.” You must be born of the spirit and undergo the long spiritual assent through childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and maturity, to that high estate wherein Jesus, through his spirit of truth, is enabled to live again in you. Essentially, this means you must consistently choose to do the Father’s will and increasingly show forth the fruits of his spirit in your daily life. 

Remember, as new teacher-leaders we are called to both teach and lead. We teach by restating Jesus’ actual teachings and we lead by living those teachings. Just as “a picture is worth a thousand words,” it is our spirit-filled presence and our life example that will make our ministry truly effective. 

So let _us_ be the ones who fulfill The Urantia Book ’s prophecy of the coming of new teacher-leaders. Let us be the ones who answer the call to bring to our “dark and confused world” a new revelation of Jesus and a bright new spiritual renaissance.

# Unsinkable and Unbreakable 

_By James Perry, MD, Raleigh, NC_ 

Marion and I would like to share some insights into marriage that we’ve discovered after 52 years of living together. We hope these insights will inspire you as you begin married life. The wedding ceremony, with all its preparations and with family and friends gathered to celebrate, is the beginning of your life together. 

After exchanging vows of commitment and loyalty, you will rest briefly from the routine challenges of life by going on a honeymoon, where you can enjoy one another without external distractions. This will be a glorious time for you, and you will reflect often about how glad you are to have found one another. 

After the honeymoon, you will face the reality of adjusting to the constant intimacy that marriage requires. You will begin to view each other as you really are, which is not a bad thing in and of itself, for this is the beginning (or can be) of a true union. Sometimes the shock of discovering the faults of your mate can be overwhelming, as some faults are hard to accept. 

And when other problems are added to this mix, it becomes very difficult to maintain a growing harmonious relationship. The problem of making a living is always there, along with the many adjustments required for successfully completing these requirements. Social interactions can often be problematic, especially issues with family; financial problems are often destabilizing. Add to this the realization that you are continually learning new things about each other. Well that’s another factor for emotional discord. You may wonder what happened to the glow of the honeymoon, when everything seemed ideal. 

This will be hard if you deeply resent one another’s more intractable deficiencies. You both will want the other person to change into your own image. This is seldom successful. Praying for one another will enable you to become patient and tolerant of each other’s faults. It will help you see one another the way the heavenly Father sees you. He knows your deficiencies and still loves you both unconditionally. 

A true test of love for one another will be your willingness to set aside pride and acknowledge, as you continue to pray for each other, that your mate is doing the best that she/he can. 

Pray Together and for Each Other. This practice is far more difficult than praying for each other separately, for it requires that all barriers to true intimacy be removed. This practice puts the heavenly Father at the center of your relationship. There is nothing more powerful than a God- centered relationship; it is here that you will realize each other’s sincerity; it is here that trust blossoms, for no moral person would invite the heavenly Father into the center of a relationship unless he/she was sincere. 

Praying together and for each other will help you grow in your understanding and knowledge of each other and will inspire you to love without conditions. This new level of happiness and satisfaction is based on spiritual reality; all barriers to intimacy fall away in the trusting presence of the heavenly Father. You will discover you as you learn to seek the best and live for, one another. Selfishness will be replaced by unselfishness, and every important matter will be subject to negotiation in good faith except the relationship itself. 

Having a God-centered relationship will not release either of you from the struggles of living. But it will ensure that you will keep faith with each other and bravely work together to solve the difficult problems of living according to the Father’s will. 

Jesus said that he is the way, the truth, and the life. Reggie and Sherry, your marriage is a path that you can use to follow Jesus. As you do this, you will discover to your everlasting satisfaction the love of the heavenly Father as it comes forth from each of your souls, out to one another, and then to all others whom you love and serve. 

Reggie and Sherry, do you want to have an unsinkable and unbreakable marriage? Then learn to truly love one another, and everything else will take care of itself. Seek the greater and the lesser will be found therein; seek to know and do the Father’s will in your lives together.

# The Supreme Being In My Life 

_By Yvon Gagne: Translated from the French by Matthew Block_ 

The following article is from the Fellowship Archives. 

_The Urantia Book_ portrays the role of the Supreme on such a magnificent scale that it is often difficult to see how each of us fits personally within this gigantic process, a process of universal proportions. My aim is to share with you my understanding and personal experience of how the Supreme enters into our active lives. My remarks reflect more my own ways of thinking, living, and expressing myself than any particular teaching. Although the teachings of The Urantia Book are basic to my account, I will endeavor to relate what I feel in my deepest self in response to the phrase “the consciousness of the Supreme.” 

The Supreme is not a God in the proper sense of the term. The Supreme is rather a Deity issuing from the Paradise Trinity. The Supreme is a super-personality who encompasses all the developing universes. He is the “project manager” of all the stellar infrastructures, coordinating the physical, intellectual, and spiritual activities of the grand universe. The Supreme therefore has a global vision of the plans and the final outworking of the universes of time. 

Descending directly from the Paradise Trinity, the Supreme enjoys a rather privileged status. He is independent of the three great administrative structures stemming from the three Paradise Deities. He takes his orders solely from the Trinity which acts (by way of comparison) as his Thought Adjuster. He enjoys uncontested legitimacy and complete autonomy throughout the universe. 

No one can communicate directly with the Supreme or seek to act upon him in any way. Although our relationship with the Supreme is impersonal, we are born in him, grow in him, and emerge from him as sons and daughters of the universe. 

## The Divine Mother 

The Supreme plays such a primal role that his presence resembles that of a diving Mother, a mother who carries within herself al the universes of time and space. The influence of the diving Mother is so omnipresent that even the Thought Adjusters, resembling the Father in nature and in divinity, become similar to the Supreme when they penetrate into the cosmos. This transformation of the Thought Adjusters leaves no doubt that the Father’s will as expressed in the time-space universes is truly unified in the Supreme.  

## The Evolutionary God 

The Supreme is not a perfect deity but rather an experiential deity undergoing the evolutionary process. The personalities in charge of the physical control of the universe work ceaselessly to master matter so as to create stability and harmony in the physical domains. Other personalities work to perfect their knowledge of all areas, to grow in wisdom and experience. Far from resembling a monolith, the Supreme appears rather as a mosaic whose unity has yet to be achieved. 

The incessant efforts of the Supreme to unify the realms of spirit, mind, and matter are reflected in the microcosmic level in the emergence of creative forces within the mind itself. These are the creative forces which impel volitional personalities of the universe to devote themselves to the construction of organized and spiritualized worlds. All the minded circuits are surcharged by creative forces which stimulate personalities—including mortals—to develop the material, morontial, and spiritual domains of our planet. Thanks to this relationship of cosmic interdependence, the divine Mother grows with the creatures of time. In the same way, human parents grow with their children in the experience of parenting.  

## Personality of The Supreme 

The Thought Adjuster is a gift of the Universal Father to the human mind, serving as an active spiritual presence in the background of human consciousness. As well as stimulating our most profound experiences, the Adjuster acts as a beacon to the mind in situations involving moral and spiritual choosing. He is the source of the inner dynamic of personality and of the desire for perfection. On a still higher level, the Adjuster is the personal contact with the Father—the reassuring relationship in prayer and the ecstatic light in worship. 

If the Supreme is a personality, then why can’t we contact him personally? We know that the Supreme has not completed his evolution, and it is this incomplete growth of the Supreme Soul that renders his personality inaccessible. But one day in the eternal future, all creatures will be able to participate simultaneously in the discovery of the personality of the Supreme when his perfection will have been universally attained. 

## Other Influences and The Supreme 

How do we relate the Supreme to the various influences which surround us, such as the Thought Adjuster, the Spirit of Truth, and the Holy Spirit? These spiritual influences both internally and externally, have diverse origins and act differently to influence us in different ways. 

The Thought Adjuster is a gift of the Universal Father to the human mind, serving as an active spiritual presence in the background of human consciousness. As well as stimulating our most profound experiences, the Adjuster acts as a beacon to the mind in situations involving moral and spiritual choosing. He is the source of the inner dynamic of personality and of the desire for perfection. On a still higher level, the Adjuster is the personal contact with the Father—the reassuring relationship in prayer and the ecstatic light in worship. 

The Spirit of Truth is defined in _The Urantia Book_ as the bestowal of the Creator Son of our local universe. While the Thought Adjuster operates on the active level of thought, the Spirit of Truth operates on the reactive level, on a whole gamut of positive or negative impressions, true or false, beautiful or ugly, good or bad, or yet again on states of the soul which are characterized by interior conviction, spiritual sensitivity, the sentiment of communion, and profound peace. Collective, the Spirit of Truth harmonizes values as they evolve not only on any single inhabited planet but in the whole local universe. The Spirit of Truth is the schema of common references bringing to bear a vision of values which we accept at once as our own and share among ourselves. 

The Holy Spirit derives from the Spirit Mother of our local universe. _The Urantia Book_ tells us that the Holy Spirit is spiritual reason and the intelligence of the soul. We understand spiritual intelligence to mean the emergence of a mind capable of both conceptual order abstract thinking with regard to the spiritual world. If the Thought Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth are the source of our most profound aspirations, the Holy Spirit translates them into meanings for the reason and finality for the soul. The Holy Spirit stimulates reflection on values and authorizes self- criticism, thus allowing us to reach the level of personal and authentic thought. 

## The Effect Of The Supreme In Us 

The unified functioning of these spiritual influences, which we refer to as the Supreme in us, generates attitudes of the soul which are sublime and rather difficult to define. For example:  
- a profound feeling of personal unity 
- a state of profound and dynamic peace 
- a sense of exceptional moral responsibility 
- a great desire for accomplishment, even a certainty of having a personal destiny or a special task to fulfil 
- a special type of discernment
- bordering on the visionary, a sensitivity to the great ethical, moral, and spiritual questions 
- a strongly marked sense of justice and equity; a feeling of belonging to the cosmic community an over-passing generosity 
- vital energy 
- and much more 

The sum total of these states of the soul denotes an intense and dynamic spiritual sensitivity accompanied by a desire to surpass oneself.  

## Cosmic Morality 

Our relation with the Supreme is the foundation for cosmic morality, the universal sensitivity to duty, and its acceptance. Cosmic morality is not what one might think at first, i.e. a doctrine which teaches us what to do and what not to do. Cosmic morality aims to determine the supreme ends of life and to exercise faith in commitment to these ends. 

Cosmic morality expresses itself to powerful appeals to the conscience, in situations appealing to moral duty, and to the sense of responsibility. The appeals to conscience embrace the great ethical, moral, and spiritual questions confronting our own day and age. It also reveals a universal sensitivity to duty which transcends the strict family and social milieu, a sensitivity which crosses religious, cultural, and language barriers.  

## A Universal Force 

The Supreme:  
- may be seen as God engaging man in the tireless work of improving the material and spiritual conditions of life on earth 
- may be defined as a sublime cosmic ideal which dominates the soul 
- may appear to be the God of brotherly love energizing the whole universe 
- may also manifest as the inner need to lose ourselves in others, to touch the world with all the human solidarity required by the brotherhood of the sons and daughters of God 
- consciousness of the Supreme may even urge the most zealous among us to engage in personal missions which may, in the eyes of most, seem to be lost causes. 

## The Planetary Consciousness 

What are the signs that the consciousness of the Supreme is evolving on a planet such as ours? The discovery of the physical laws which govern the material world has gradually liberated us from the metaphysics of fear, superstition, and guilt. 

In the future, it won’t be so much that humanity will change, as that our vision of society, our vision of humanity, our vision of the planet, and our vision of the universe, will change. An embryonic form of planetary consciousness is now growing, and is leading us to the stage of conscious and collective responsibility. The consciousness of the Supreme does not emerge in our minds to complicate our peaceful lives but rather to solve problems related to our individual and collective growth. 

The consciousness of the Supreme renders us spiritual pillars in the service of the Reserve Corps of Destiny, composed of volunteers and thinkers who are sincerely devoted to the service of the human fraternity as our planet slowly advances toward the age of light and life. Because of the vital growth we play in the very growth of the universe, the Supreme confers on each of us the status of potential universe citizen, a citizen with virtually boundless rights and privileges, but also with duties and responsibility worthy of the most beautiful of destinies offered in this age.  

# The Eden-Atlantis Project 

The Proposed Archeological Site of Eden and Atlantis in the Eastern Mediterranean 

_By Commodore Robert Stanley Bates United States Merchant Marine_ 

Copyright © 2018 Batek Marine Publishing 

Plato’s legendary account of a sunken island civilization that he called Atlantis—or what some call Eden—has fascinated adventurers for centuries. But the sophisticated archeological search for this lost culture as had to wait for our time, with its digital technology and advanced underwater research capabilities. 

Recent efforts to find the vanished island have, I believe, culminated in two exciting underwater surveys in the Eastern Mediterranean that were staged in 2004 and 2006. Each of these expeditions uncovered tantalizing evidence, and both were initiated by _Urantia Book_ students looking for what they believe are the remnants of the First Garden.     

In this essay, I argue that our search for this pre-historic civilization may now be narrowed to sunken land adjacent to the island of Cyprus, a virtual underwater continent that geologists located decades ago. In recognition of the likely confluence of the two great legends of Atlantis and Eden, I call the ongoing archeological research into this sunken continent the Eden-Atlantis Project. 

The main purpose of this essay is to offer you a thorough review of recently obtained archeological evidence pointing to this Eastern Mediterranean location for Eden-Atlantis. Please note before we go further: This essay offers a digest of a short book, _The Eden- Atlantis Project_, that is available at my website, [http://www.](http://www.) edenatlantisproject.org; color versions of the images in this piece are available in the book and at this website. 

My ultimate objective is to provide a novel explanation of the data acquired in the 2004 and 2006 expeditions. I offer this new interpretation not only because I played a vital part in both efforts, but because I have spent almost 15 years in ongoing reflection on our findings. This intensive focus has inspired me over these many years to embark on a journey to a wide variety of related geological and historical sources that provide support to my revised interpretation. The result today is that I believe we may have uncovered, without realizing it, unmistakable human infrastructure on this landmass that was submerged in the eastern Mediterranean at a very distant time. In particular, the data resulting from our 2006 sub-bottom profiler (SBP) survey yielded some unexpected results that have not been previously understood: It points to the existence of at least two very large human-built artifacts that were able to survive war, flooding, and violent tectonic plate activity in pre-historic times. As I will show, this new data significantly increases our knowledge about human activities on this sunken continent, and if my interpretation is correct, it points to the need for a third expedition to this site.  

## The Story of Eden in The Urantia Book 

The most specific information about what I call the Eden-Atlantis legend can be found, of course, in The Urantia Book, which purports to describe the site of the original Eden on the basis of its claim that the biblical story of Adam and Eve refers to an actual historic event. The Urantia Revelation provides a detailed narrative of the life of Adam and Eve, which it states is offered to the modern world as a corrective to the distorted ideas handed down in Genesis. 

Most notably for our purposes, the UB reveals the physical location of what it names as the “First Garden of Eden,” calling it: “... _a long narrow peninsula—almost an island—projecting westward from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean Sea ._” [73.3.1] (P. 823) It continues: “_The coast line of this land mass was considerably elevated, and the neck connecting with the mainland was only twenty-seven miles wide at the narrowest point. The great river that watered the Garden came down from the higher lands of the peninsula and flowed east through the peninsular neck to the mainland and thence across the lowlands of Mesopotamia to the sea beyond_ .” [73.3.4] (P. 823) 

The Urantia text further states: “ _At the center of the Edenic peninsula was the exquisite stone temple of the Universal Father, the sacred shrine of the Garden_ .” [73:5.1] (P. 824) Mention of a central hill (i.e., the general location of this temple), as well as mound-building activity, is provided in the following narrative: “Adam and Eve were escorted to the formal reception on the great mound to the north of the temple. This natural hill had been enlarged and made ready for the installation of the  world’s new rulers .”_ [74.2.5] (P. 829) As we continue on, consider the possibility of a link between this enlarged “great mound” and the “hill of no great size” that is “covered” as mentioned by Plato. 

_The Urantia Book_ further states concerning the infrastructure of Eden: _“The sanitary arrangements of the Garden were far in advance of anything that had been attempted theretofore on Urantia. The drinking water of Eden was kept wholesome by the strict observance of the sanitary regulations designed to conserve its purity...”_ [73.5.3] (P. 824) Most important for our investigation is this statement: _“Before the disruption of the Adamic regime a covered brick-conduit disposal system had been constructed which ran beneath the walls and emptied into the river of Eden almost a mile beyond the outer or lesser wall of the Garden .”_ [73.5.3] (P. 824) 

It is also worth noting that in _The Urantia Book_ version of this story, Eden-Atlantis met a similar fate as that described in other narratives about Atlantis: _“...i n connection with the violent activity of the surrounding volcanoes and the submergence of the Sicilian land bridge to Africa, the eastern floor of the Mediterranean Sea sank, carrying down beneath the waters the whole of the Edenic peninsula .”_ [73.7.1] (P. 826) In addition, previous to its sinking, catastrophic warfare had emptied out the peninsula of its original inhabitants. [75:5-6] (P. 844) 

Because of the detailed and potentially verifiable information it provides, a student of _The Urantia Book_ named Robert Sarmast chose to explore the physical location given in _The Urantia Book_. Before his two historic expeditions in 2004 and 2006, he claimed in a widely reviewed book that this location “conformed to 48 out of 50” clues about Atlantis provided by Plato. This site, he said, was one mile down in the waters of the eastern Mediterranean Sea between Cyprus and Syria. 

I believe that the features reported not only by _The Urantia Book_ and the Bible, but also by other ancient narratives such as the well-known Sumerian text known as _Enki and the World Order_ and Plato’s account of Atlantis in his dialogues _Critias_ and _Timaeus_, point us to the likely location of the Eden-Atlantis site and the need for advanced archeological research in this area. According to my interpretation of the sources and also the writings of Sarmast, this research will take us back to a time when this island was above water and habitable. 

Recent archeological findings from around the Mediterranean also support the idea that this area was inhabited and settled in very far distant times. Remarkable new archeological evidence and lingering pools of genetics depart from the previous views that only Cro-Magnon hunter-gatherers lived in the surrounding lands during that time frame. For example, in the June 2016 edition of Discover magazine, an article reported that: “About 100,000 years ago tall, long-limbed humans lived in the caves of Qafzeh, east of Nazareth, and Skhul, on Israel’s Mount Carmel. Their remains suggest a surprisingly sophisticated people defying the conventional timeline of Homo sapiens ’ migration “out of Africa.”[^1] In addition, a plethora of evidence from around the Mediterranean should be considered. This evidence includes unexplained cave drawings in Spain and France as far distant as over 30,000 years, as well as regions that bordered the eastern Mediterranean Sea in those prehistoric days—such as present-day Egypt and most notably the very remarkable findings at the Golbeki Tepi archaeological site in modern- day Turkey—all of which point to the likelihood of highly intelligent inhabitants of a local advanced civilization. Fortunately, scientists have discovered a sunken continent in that general neighborhood, and this land is an excellent candidate for the location of the original source-civilization that branched out and blossomed around that region thousands of years before the times of Sumeria and Egypt.  

###### Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent 

The foregoing is a lot to absorb. But to a large extent these various claims fit together comfortably when we look more closely at the candidate for the physical venue of the Eden-Atlantis story, to which we now turn. This area is generally called the Levantine Basin by geologists, and the part of the Levantine Basin that is of greatest interest to us is what I like to call Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent. 

Again, the general location of our venue is the eastern Mediterranean. Thanks to the many marine geophysicists who have studied it for decades, we now know a lot about this region. Of special note in this connection is the work of John K. Hall, PhD. In 1970, Hall became the first marine geophysicist to work for the Geological Survey of Israel. He founded the Israel National Bathymetric Survey to map the seas around Israel, and his work continued for 35 years. In his 2005 work, Geological Framework of the Levant,^2 he explains that this underwater region sits at the junction of three tectonic plates. 

> The Levantine Basin is traditionally the deep basin at the eastern end of the Mediterranean. The region hosts the junction of three plates, whose interaction has produced complex structures. Because of its relative remoteness, and the uneasy relationships between the seven national entities along its littoral, the area was not easy to investigate. However, the probing since the 1970s has shown that the basin is filled with a great quantity of sediments (12 meters or more), and that the nature of its underpinnings is not simple. Many investigators have studied the area. Some have returned again and again to this problematic place. 

According to Hall, this area has been studied using the tools of bathymetry, gravity, magnetics, seismic reflection, seismic refraction, teleseismic investigations, and submarine geology based on coring, drilling, and dredging. In the passage that follows the one quoted above, Hall refers to Robert Sarmast’s research, which is in large part based on the work of a Russian geologist named Malovitskiy: 

> The region’s recent history also seems to beckon. From the pioneering study of our colleague Ya’akov Petrovitch Malovitskiy^3 (1978) who proposed on the basis of seismic investigations that the Levantine Basin was a sunken continent, we advance to recent extrapolations (Sarmast, 2003) regarding the ‘finding’ of Atlantis at depths of 1,500 m between the West Tartus Ridge and the Gelendzhik Rise, based upon a computer analysis of the Russian Research Vessel (R/V) Strakhov’s multibeam soundings. 

Figure 2. Map of the three plates to which Dr. Hall refers: Anatolian, Arabian and African. (Courtesy of National Geographic Magazine, October 2002, p. 125) 

The target area of our research sits at the point of convergence of the Anatolian, Arabian, and African plates, as shown in Figure 2. This region is located on that part of the African Plate that is wedged between Cyprus, Syria, and Lebanon. According to geologists, for millions of years the African plate has been sliding down (or “subducting’) beneath the Anatolian Plate while also being subjected to pressures from the Arabian Plate. The result over time has been significant tectonic instability in this area. 

We read in the Urantia text that “violent” volcanic activity at the juncture of these plates, combined with a massive tectonic shift further to the west near present-day Sicily, caused this area to sink far beneath the waves. If true, this event was a tectonic calamity. In fact, it may have caused (or was caused by) the so-called Great Flood that is referred to in many ancient myths that we noted earlier. This pre-historic flood may have occurred when, according once again to the Urantia text: “_...in connection with the violent activity of the surrounding volcanoes and the submergence of the Sicilian land bridge to Africa, the eastern floor of the Mediterranean Sea sank, carrying down beneath the waters the whole of the Edenic peninsula_ .” [73:7.1] (P. 826) 

This sunken land that I call Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent became the focus of study in the 1990s by the previously mentioned American explorer, author, and Urantia Book student, Robert Sarmast. He wrote and lectured in those years on his theories about Atlantis, postulating the existence of an extraordinary civilization at this location. As I mentioned, he also had in mind—but did not mention publicly— The Urantia Book ’s statements about the location of Eden. When not speaking to audiences of Urantia Book students, Sarmast switched out Eden for Atlantis; like him, I think of the two as identical, but unlike him I am prepared to refer to the Urantia material publicly. 

In 2003 Sarmast published Discovery of Atlantis,^4 which makes the case that Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent is the lost continent of Atlantis (and implicitly Eden). Among his most striking claims of evidence was the digital reconstruction of the sunken continent shown below in Figure 3 that’s based on data chosen from among the many scientific surveys of this region to which the geologist Hall refers. 

To support his thesis, Sarmast mounted a privately funded exploratory expedition in 2004, drawing financial support from a large number of Urantia Book students, with the aim of probing the surface of the sunken content using a research technology known as side-scan sonar. The second edition of his book in 2006 incorporated the results of this survey, after which Sarmast led a widely publicized expedition in November 2006 that was funded, filmed, and broadcast by The History Channel.

## The First Expedition in 2004 

Initially, Sarmast planned the 2004 expedition based on bathymetric data that Hall had published in 1994. The data had originally been acquired by the Russian R/V Academik Nikolaj Strakhov and Sarmast used it to generate the image in Figure 3. The Strakhov’s expeditions, which were completed in 1987 and 1990, used a sonar technique known as bathymetric multibeam scanning. Sarmast received this raw data, which he then sent for analysis to marine geophysicist Patrick Lowry at the Scotia Group in Dallas, Texas. Lowry returned 3-D graphic images that presented a fairly detailed map of Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent. Lowry “computerized” the lowering of the water level in that end of the Mediterranean Sea (using as a template from the R/V Strakhov’s scans), allowing Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent to emerge. It became when the sea level was lowered 1500 meters, or about one mile, as seen in Figure 3. 

But in 2003, the R/V Le Suroît from L’Institut Français de Recherche pour l’Exploitation de la Mer (IFREMER), surveyed the same area using a later generation of bathymetric multibeam scan technology, thereby acquiring data that provided greater resolution of the ocean floor.[^5] (Bathymetric multibeam technology uses a sonar device that emits fan-shaped pulses down toward the seafloor across a wide angle that is perpendicular to the path of the sensor as it moves through the water.) In July of 2004, Sarmast contacted a principal investigator at IFREMER for permission to access their more definitive data (along with their much better navigational information), and requested data for an area fifteen nautical miles square around the mound in the center of Figure[^4]. 

Notably, the well-defined ridges that appeared in the center (based on the multibeam bathymetric IFREMER data), seemed to support Sarmast’s claim that some sort of megalithic structures existed within the black square in figure[^4].   

Figure 4. Central part of Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent. (From IFREMER scan data and Scotia Group imagery)   

An enlarged graphical display of this structure is provided in Figure 5, which depicts what appears to be a 3700-meter-long, narrow, regular, linear Y-formation in the northern part of the area. In addition, just to the south was a 2800-meter-long irregular low tabular mound about 110 meters high and varying between 500 to 800 meters wide. Also in evidence are scarp-like features half way up the mound, leading off to both the eastern and western sides. (A scarp is a very steep bank or slope.) This general area became the primary target of both the 2004 and 2006 expeditions. Bear in mind, however, that the height of these features are magnified ten-fold to enhance them for study.

The information from the IFREMER multibeam sonar scans provided excellent orientation for Sarmast’s first expedition in November of 2004, offering precise latitude and longitude coordinates for specific points on the major features to be studied. With such accurate coordinates it was possible to obtain useful side-scan images of the central mound and the linear ridges. 

The ship used for the 2004 expedition was the motor vessel (M/V) Flying Enterprise. Captain Duncan MacKenzie, a husky South African with years of sea service, was the ship’s master for this voyage. Given my decades of previous experience with research and commercial voyages of this kind, I was in the role of expedition leader. The ship was perfectly suited for our purpose; in fact it qualifies as a medium-size research vessel with winches, cranes, and an A-frame for the deployment of our underwater probe attached to a coaxial cable.

The images acquired from the 2004 expedition using the side-scan sonar provided the first close look at the ridges and the summit of the central mound as seen in Figure 5 above. In particular, these images offered more accurate measurements of the ridges, showing a uniform width of approximately 30 meters and a fairly constant gradient from west to east, descending from a height of 10 meters down to the seabed surface, as shown in Figure 11. These findings confirmed our hypothesis that these formations cannot be of natural origin. As noted, no other formations in the entire area resembled those of the two ridges. 

The tracks along which the side-scan sonar traces were recorded over the ridges and central mound were documented in Figure 7 by team member Axel Schoeller. Schoeller first laid grid lines along an axis of our intended courses over the central mound. The base line for the ridges was labeled “Wall 1” and a parallel scan line to the north was labeled “1-175” indicating it was 175 meters distant from the “Wall 1” line. The use of a minus sign in the figure means “north of” Wall 1, while the plus sign for scans on the central mount indicates “south of” a datum mark (not shown on the chart because it is off the north end of the chart) by the number of meters from that datum point indicated by the numbers following the “3+.”

The images produced by the side-scan sonar lines in Figure 7 are associated with the same line number next to those images in Figure 8. They provided the historical first close look at the ridges and the summit of the central mound. The line numbers and the associated images will be frequently referred to in the text that follows.

The 3700-meter-long ridge formation first received attention from Lowry in early September 2004 when the data from the R/V _Le Suroît_ were obtained from IFREMER and sent to him. Except for Sarmast, no one prior to that time reported any significance attached to that anomaly. At first, Lowry was of the opinion that the slump on the face of the associated mound and the transverse ridges at the foot of the mound fit the classical depiction of a natural slump—that is, the accumulation of material from a landslide off the front side of the mound as seen in Figure 10. Later we will consider a much different interpretation of these features that results from the data acquired in the 2006 expedition.

## The Second Expedition in 2006 

Robert Sarmast’s first expedition caught the attention of media around the world, including favorable coverage in CNN, the BBC, and ABC News. As a result of all of this positive publicity, the rights to a second expedition were purchased in 2006 by The History Channel. They funded and filmed an elaborate program that launched Josh Bernstein’s popular 2007 series called Digging for the Truth. 

The History Channel’s documentary about Sarmast’s second expedition is entitled: Atlantis–New Revelations. The History Channel personnel did exhaustive research for the two-hour documentary. They covered all the latest Atlantis theories in the program and disposed of alternate theories that had no merit regarding the location of Atlantis. The primetime program first aired in January 2007 and it especially highlighted the work of Sarmast and his team.

Notwithstanding his lack of experience, Sarmast made the executive decision that he would be expedition leader in 2006. The ship used for that expedition was the 41 meter long M/T EDT Argonaut (Figure 11) operated by EDT Towage and Salvage Co., our previous provider based in Limassol, Cyprus.^6 This time, more advanced equipment was used in addition to side-scan sonar, most notably a sub-bottom profiler (SBP)—an instrument that uses echo sounding, like sonar, to map the strata as deep as 30 meters below the surface of the sea bed. Another instrument known as a depth sounder, which is crucial for guiding the towfish, was also on board. Only five tracks were planned for the 2006 expedition, as shown in Figure 12. The plan was to crisscross as much as the area as possible with both side-scan and SBP during the 72 hours that were allotted for the trip. The first and longest line was designed to capture the cross section of both branches of the ridges and the central mound. 

Figure 12. The five tracks planned for the 2006 expedition. The longest, heaviest line (Line 1) crossed both branches of the narrow, regular, linear Y-formation as well as the hill. Because of serious technical problems during the expedition, Line 1 was the only line that was actually surveyed. Notice the inserted chart in the upper right, which we return to later.. (Photo by Axel Schoeller) 

Unlike the tracks surveyed during the 2004 expedition, the first line in 2006 was designed to create a cross- sectional view of the ridges and the hill, intersecting them at nearly a ninety degree right-angle. In 2004, the lines went parallel to the hill and the ridges so that the towfish depth would require only small changes during the survey of each line. We felt in 2004 that it was too risky, due to the uneven terrain, to require the constant change of the tow fish’s depth. (See the inset in Figure 12 above and Figure 19 below for changes in elevation along Line 1 in the 2006 expedition.) But with the towfish streaming about a mile astern in the 2006 effort, the ship’s depth sounder 

would have made it possible to anticipate the required depth changes of the towfish as it traversed the irregular sea bottom. But as fate would have it, we suffered several highly disruptive technical problems during the 2006 expedition. And they were not amenable to emergency repair as in the previous expedition, when we had serious problems because of a heavy rain squall on the first day. 

The first of the problems in the 2006 effort was very distressing. Shortly after the towfish was launched, the signal suddenly stopped transmitting. The crew had no choice but to retrieve the towfish to find out why. The expedition team was soon able to determine that, due to operator error, the paying out of the coaxial cable took place at an excessive rate of speed. This careless method of deployment of the tow fish resulted in knots in the cable, and even snapped the internal wiring. About five hours and 50 meters of cable were lost. 

Additional operator error as well as equipment failure resulted in the loss of even more data and valuable time during the succeeding attempts to survey along Line  1. In fact, the problem of equipment failure was alone debilitating. At the end of the voyage, Lowry reported that two vital instruments were never operational during the entire trip, namely: (1) the Ultra Short Base Line (USBL) responder that locates the position of the towfish and adjusts for its GPS position, and (2) the depth sounder which measures the distance between the keel of the ship and the sea bottom below. Without those instruments it becomes extremely difficult to anticipate the optimum depth of the towfish because the operator is unable to determine the GPS position of the towfish along the track line. 

The beam that emanates from the SBP and penetrates the sea floor is only about three degrees wide. One of its functions is to average the data received as the tow fish proceeds along its path. The detailed images from the SBP data are of the greatest definition when the tow fish is as close as possible to the submerged target of interest. With the depth sounder inoperative, it became very difficult for the technicians who were operating the towfish to closely skim the bottom. If the towfish were too high above the bottom, the three degree beam would cover such a large area that it would provide little or no definition as it averages everything below it that the beam reaches. On the other hand, if the towfish were too close to the target, it would be in danger of striking the bottom, providing no data at all and causing damage to the tow fish and the cable. Without anticipating the depth at which the towfish should be operated at any given moment, I surmise that it was sheer luck that the one image we have of a ridge was captured along Line 1. It also appears, after the fact, that the towfish may have collided with the outer ridge along Line 1 which resulted in a loss of signal during its transit of that ridge. To make matters worse, the exact location of the image that was captured remains unknown because the USBL was inoperative. Fortunately, we had a means of estimating the positions of the towfish as it crossed the two ridges along Line 1. 

Sailing with key equipment inoperative is attributable to faulty installation by the charterer, EDT Towage and Salvage Co., Ltd. In a case like this, as in the 2004 voyage, this expedition should have been declared “off hire” and the contract time for the charter suspended until the deficiencies were corrected. Unfortunately, the USBL responder and the depth sounder could not be tested in port prior to getting underway; they were discovered to be inoperative only after having put to sea. An USBL can only be tested when the tow fish is deployed in the water, and the harbor is too shallow to test the depth sounder. Given this dilemma, it is also unfortunate that the expedition leader, Robert Sarmast, made the decision to _not go_ “off hire” and return to port for repairs. 

As a result of Sarmast’s decision, the time charter came to an end without having corrected the serious technical problems, and only a partially successful attempt to survey Line 1 had been completed by the close of the expedition. Fortunately, SPB data for one of the two ridges had been obtained, and we will now turn to an analysis of that image. 

Previous to the 2006 expedition, the face of the mound with its obvious main and minor scarps—as well as the transverse ridges associated with it—gave the appearance of a natural slump or landslide, as we noted in Figure 10. But significantly, the main result of the 2006 expedition dispels that idea—at least according to my reading of the data that resulted from the one and only line of SBP data we had acquired along Line 1. The SBP image in Figure 13 provides an excellent cross-sectional look at the ridge closest to the central mound. (Recall that the SBP can trace features up to 30 meters below the surface.) 

Figure 13 .(opposite) The cross-section of the ridge closest to the central mound returned in 2006 by the SBP data. Shown also are the lines of continuous stratum of the ridge formation as drawn by marine geologist Patrick Lowry. (Courtesy of Patrick Lowry from Seatronics SBP scan)   

When the images were received, Lowry drew in the lines of each continuous stratum in different colors as seen in Figure 13. In his final conclusion, provided on site during the filming of the expedition, he concluded that the ridges were natural formations. He stated on camera in The History Channel documentary that the ridges were not influenced by man, and concluded that: “Those ridges are cored by something natural, not manmade.”^7 His analysis, and the way it was framed in the closing moments of the documentary, seemed to set to rest the hypothesis that the ridges were the consequence of human engineering. Lowry’s conclusion has gone unchallenged until the new interpretation I will now provide.   

## Questioning the Results of The 2006 Expedition 

Lowry’s assessment that the linear ridges were, in effect, only the natural result of a geological upward thrust still leaves us with crucial unanswered questions. The following list arises when one closely observes the ridges, the mound, and other previously obtained images of various features that we will soon examine in detail:  
1. What combination of events and forces caused these up-thrust ridges to appear so uniformly linear over several thousand meters? Why are they so well-shaped, as if they had direction and purpose? 
2. Further, why are these ridges so unique in this entire region? 
3. Is there any evidence that the formation of the ridges, now covered in silt, was ever influenced by human activities? 
4. Is the nature of the slump on the face of the mound typical of the effect produced by a natural landslide? Or might it be further evidence of human activity? 
5. Is there any location in this region that may indicate the source of material for brick making? Is there any evidence of artifacts remaining that were constructed of brick? 

Our crucial premise has been that Malovitskiy’s Continent sunk in relatively recent times. If we can accept that premise, then the discovery of well-engineered structures on the ocean bottom would lead one to wonder whether Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent really does fit with the old myths about Atlantis or Eden. In other words, we logically come face-to-face with the ultimate question, the one that subsumes the more specific questions above: Are the ridges and mound we see at this location purely a creation of nature according to the claim of Lowry, or was their formation somehow influenced by unknown indigenous people who occupied the land when it was a verdant peninsula? 

Let us return to the image returned by the SBP as shown in Figure 13. As noted, their appearance of continuity, gradient, linearity, and the lack of any other formations like them in the surrounding area, leads to the notion that humans were involved in their creation. Unfortunately, none of these observations constitute sufficient proof by themselves, although they do point to the need for further analysis. 

Let’s turn back for clues to what the Urantia text states about this area: _“...in connection with the violent activity of the surrounding volcanoes and the submergence of the Sicilian land bridge to Africa, the eastern floor of the Mediterranean Sea sank, carrying down beneath the waters the whole of the Edenic peninsula._ ” [73:7.1] (P. 826-7) If indeed Malovitskiy’s continent sank to its present level in this or in some other manner (such as that suggested by Plato), we can be sure that in calculable subducting forces caused the catastrophic collapse and descent of the land. At the same time, a second and related inference is quite reasonable: There must have been resisting forces acting in the opposite direction that caused formation of the unusual ridges. In fact, according to statements made by Patrick Lowry in the documentary, the ridge seen in Figure 13 confirms the presence of strong up-thrusting forces, presumably during the sinking of the land, but conceivably also sometime after. In Figure 13 that is reproduced at the top of Figure 14, Lowry’s tracings of strata lines in various colors of ink shows how the strata had welled up. (Please see color versions of all images at http://www.edenatlantisproject.org.) 

Aside from the aforementioned characteristics displayed by the ridges, when viewed in cross section, there is an additional anomaly apparent in this cross- sectional image: An unlikely change in the direction of the concavity in Lowry’s colored strata lines can be seen near the center of the ridge (in the upper image in Figure 14.) This change should have alerted him to an unexpected variance in the process of the formation of the ridge. Let me to put it this way: If the up-thrust forces were acting only in an unimpeded natural seismic event, the strata lines probably would have been uniformly concave downward. But they are not. The direction of the strata changes from an expected concave downward to concave upward near the center of the lines drawn, and then returns to concave downward. To my mind, we can examine the strata immediately below the downward deflection, and perhaps the reason for the deflection might become apparent. 

Now, let’s examine the illustration at the bottom of Figure14. Note that I have added four brighter strata lines below the deflected strata drawn by Lowry and I have juxtaposed my new version of the image with Lowry’s earlier work on the same image just above it. The additional lines reveal a telltale anomaly: They clearly indicate a well-defined impediment to the up-thrusting ridge. These additional lines show the location and size of the implied resistance, as indicated by the white arrow. Also note that this variance appears about 15 meters below the top of the silt-covered ridge. This is significant, because according to Hall’s report cited earlier: “...the probing since the 1970s has shown that the basin is filled with a great quantity of sediments (12 meters or more)...” 

These observations have led me to a new hypothesis about the nature of the impediment and how it can be interpreted within the context of a discussion of the purpose, direction, position, length, breadth, and height of the ridges.

## A Revealing New Interpretation of the Ridges 

Can it really be true that this sunken land that sits one mile down was once inhabited by an advanced but pre-historic civilization? To answer this crucial question, we will need to examine any and all evidence of artifacts indicating the presence of human engineering. 

We can start with the aforementioned fact that the Y-formation of ridges is unnaturally straight and narrow over a very long distance and that there is no other natural formation of this type in the area. Because of their anomalous features, it follows that these ridges could very well be the result of a fairly sophisticated engineering effort. In particular, the regular width and gradually diminishing height of the ridges point to a “surgical” removal of the earth’s crust along the ridges’ path. Further, I argue that the amount of earth removed must have been sufficient to permit the up-thrust forces to break through the crust and erupt into their present state of uniform width and height and long, straight extension. 

The simplest form of construction to accommodate that effect is, I believe, a uniformly dug ditch. This trench would need to be of sufficient width and depth to enable the up-thrust forces to break through the earth’s crust. This interpretation points to a rather mundane but very distinctive form of human engineering: the aforementioned _“covered brick-conduit disposal system”_ that the Urantia text describes as part of the infrastructure of the Edenic civilization. We are told that this conduit was created for the health and welfare of the population as a sewage drainage system. 

We can infer that the construction of such a conduit system required some civil engineering far in advance for its time. In order to prepare for building a subterranean conduit, not only would a ditch have to be dug, but also a footing would have to be created. The ditch would have to be of sufficient depth and width to accommodate a brick structure with working room for its construction. At first glance, it would probably look as if these ancient residents were building a canal, but unlike a canal, it would have to be constructed with sufficient gradient to permit a flow from its origins to its terminus. The width and depth of this canal-like ditch would likely be uniform, and one can only imagine the primitive way in which earth was removed to create such a major undertaking. In terms of geology, the significant point here is that there would be just enough etching of the earth’s crust by the uniformly dug ditches to permit an upward release of material through this narrow, man-made channel caused by the force of the up-thrusting subterranean material. The upwelling along sections of this excavation may have continued until the energy dissipated or the conduit disappeared sufficiently below the surface due to its gradient. In either event, there is no visible indication that the up-thrust continued farther to the east or the west beyond what we can see in the images. 

Once the work of digging canal-like ditches was in progress, we can speculate that the fabrication of bricks was a primary requirement, whether molded at a quarry or manufactured somewhere in the area. Possible quarry sites have been identified on the sunken continent at various stages of this study and will be discussed later. 

The two visually striking branches of the system that we see in Figure 10 rising from the basin’s surface come together in a “Y” formation at the base of the mound. The two ridges meet a tan acute angle in the “Y” formation in such a way that, I believe, the effluent could commingle and flow easily toward a terminus. 

During the sinking process of the floor and the upward heaving of material through the ditches, it may be that the conduit was crushed. But even if some or all of it were crushed, the deflection of Lowry’s lines of strata in Figures 13 and 14 nevertheless would be unaffected because the building material would have been much denser than that of the surrounding dirt. 

To further support this observation, there is additional evidence in the images from the SBP. The black stratum line at the bottom of the ditch, which is collinear with the bright line I added (just above the tip of the white arrow probably reveals the location of the base of the conduit system. It is of such dense material that the energy from the probing sonic beam was unable to completely penetrate and record the strata immediately below. There appears to be a notable attenuation of the SBP signal below the bright red line representing the bottom or crushed remains of the conduit. Also note that below that line, the strata are fairly uniformly concave downward in the up-thrust, which is the how the upper portion would appear had it not been for the denser impediment to the rising material. 

If we combine the evidence of the top-down images of the ridges in Figure 5 with the cross-sectional images of the up-thrusts in Figure 14, we can make a prima facie case for the existence of the conduit system. If these are, indeed, identifiable archaeological features on Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent, the Eden-Atlantis legend may finally have a venue in prehistory on which to base future research. Unfortunately, the venue is not on dry land as we wish it could be. Nevertheless, the 2006 expedition yielded sufficient evidence to consider the ridges to be a conduit system. When we combine this with our other sources, I believe the case can be made for that of working subterranean brick conduits. This engineered artifact could very well be the oldest major remnant of any civilization on earth. 

## A New Interpretation of the Mound 

The case for the engineered subterranean conduit system alone could well be enough evidence to support the hypothesis that an advanced civilization lived on the surface of Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent when it was a dry peninsula. But the mound can offer even more evidence of human involvement. 

Recall that Lowry had offered the opinion in 2004 that the slump on the face of the mound and the transverse ridges at the foot of the mound, when taken together, fit the classical depiction of a natural slump—a landslide. He gave no further explanation of the slump on camera at the end of the 2006 expedition. But the evidence I have now offered may be a game changer. My improved description of the nature of the ridges’ seismic up-thrusts based on empirical evidence allows us to logically separate the ridges and the slump into distinct features that are independent of each other. Separating these two features invites us to look elsewhere for an explanation of the true nature of the mound. A closer look at the slump on the face of the mound as seen in Figures 5 and 10 reveals that it lacks the classic features of a landslide as shown below in Figure 15 (top image). On our mound (bottom image) we observe no foot, no cracks, and no discernible surface of rupture or separation. The only visible parts of this slump are, in my estimation, the crown, the main scarp, and the two minor scarps. Also, the ridges as a whole are unlike the classic transverse ridges of a typical landslide. 

Figure 15. A comparison of features of a classic landslide with the enlarged image of the mound. (The image depicting the parts of a typical landslide is provided online by the U.S. Geological Survey.) 

I offer an alternative explanation for this anomalous hill: I contend that this feature is evidence of a ceremonial mound. Archaeologists and anthropologists have long known that the building of ceremonial mounds by indigenous people all over the world often entails some form of earthwork enhancement of natural hills. (In the more advanced versions of such ceremonial platforms, they build actual pyramids or ziggurats from stone, erecting them from the ground up.) Often, such an earthen enhancement to a natural hill is intended to give these early peoples an elevated surface for holding gatherings and rituals; in other cases, elaborate mounds encompass burial sites. With sufficient material and an abundance of labor, an ordinary hill can be turned into ceremonial site by squaring up its sides and extending the length of the elevated section in one or both directions. 

As the millennia go by, seismic events or flooding and erosion can obviously lead to the disintegration of an enhanced ceremonial mound. Logically, earthwork enlargement erected around a natural hill would be first of its features to falter. Bear in mind that the height of all the images shown here is exaggerated by a factor of ten, so the actual amount of material involved is considerably less than suggested by those exaggerated images. At the correct scale, the slump on this hill would be hardly more than a crumbled man-made dirt façade, the remnants of mound- building activity—the simple artifact to which The Urantia Book refers in Paper 73. 

An important alternate description of this feature, or what Plato called “Acropolis Hill,” can be found in the Critias (112): “The layout of the city was as follows: The Acropolis was different from what it is now. Today it is quite bare of soil which was all washed away in one appalling night of flood, by a combination of earthquakes and the third terrible deluge...Before that, in earlier days... it was covered with soil and for the most part level.” Here Plato also reports that there was a mound “of no great size” that was for the most part level at the top, but that the part covered up with soil (presumably by the inhabitants), was eventually reduced by earthquakes and washed away by floods. 

Plus, other curiosities can be found on (what we have taken to be) the enlarged man-made platform at the top of the mound. The IFREMER bathymetric scans suggest an interesting anomaly: what appears to be three coplanar, collinear, circular segments—that is, three circular features hundreds of feet across of nearly equal size that are directly adjacent to one another. 

This feature, if it is truly present, sharply differentiates the central mound from the mud volcanoes that dot this landscape. Mud volcanoes in the area have a single depression in the center of their cones. In addition, they do not cluster in groups to form uniformly continuous tabular mounds as shown here and in Figure 4. 

Figure 17. The IFREMER multibeam image of the summit of the mound (see first figure above), if overlayed with side-scan images of the mound, can be combined to show mysterious physical circular segments if the side-scan images are enlarged to the proper scale.

Figure 18 (opposite) easternmost (leftmost) circular arcs in Figure  17. (Composite by author from side-scan images:3+2975, 3+3150 and 3+3325) 

Circular arcs on the top of the mound in the IFREMER scans are somewhat discernible in Figure 17 (top image). The side-scan sonar images from the 2004 expedition tempt us to think that these are due to actual physical circular features around the summit as seen in the bottom image. That the circumference of some of these circles extends beyond the remains of the platform in some places suggests that the natural surface of the top of the hill had been enlarged to accommodate each fully circular feature, after which the enhanced area fell away. Additional studies are essential to establish the true nature of these circular features. 

Certainly modern technology is poised to thoroughly investigate those features.  

## The Great River and the South Side of the Mound 

One of the byproducts of the SBP scan is a graph compiled during the 2006 expedition called the “Path Profile.” It shows the elevation of the sea bed during the transit along Line 1.This gives us a picture of the south side of the central mound (the right hand side of Figure 21) and reveals a much smaller scarp at the -1500 meter level. Its cause may be the same as that on the north side: the dramatic shifting of the tectonic plates and all that followed. 

A major feature at the foot of the south side of the mound is a deep concave depression below the -1600 meter level in Figure 20.In studying Figure 4, there is an obvious line of what appears to be a river bank on the south side of the mound that extends left to right for thousands of meters in both directions. An examination of the IFREMER bathymetric scans throughout the area yields no similar feature that could be interpreted as a continuous river bank. And, the literature about this peninsula leaves no doubt that an important river meandered through the land, as I recount below.  

Figure 19. A closer look at the insert in Figure 12. The Path Profile compiled during the scan of Line 1 shows features from left to right of the two ridges, the main scarp, the top of the hill and a slight scarp on the back of the hill (-1500m) ending with the lowest point, probably a river bed bottom (below -1600 m).

First of all, let’s turn to Sumerian writings. In _Enki and the New World Order_ we are told that one of the ways Lord Enki got around his island paradise was by water. His mode of transportation is by an oar-propelled barge, which is evidently capable of navigating the river as well as a complex of canals and smaller waterways in the great marshes. 

Next, the Bible prominently mention a river associated with the Garden of Eden in Genesis 2:10: “Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four rivers.” The prophet Ezekiel also spoke of seeing a river flowing from below the Temple in a vision, which happens to coincide with the location I propose—below the mound: 

“The man brought me back to the entrance to the temple, and I saw water coming out from under the threshold of the temple toward the east (for the temple faced east). The water was coming down from under the south side of the temple, south of the altar. He then brought me out through the north gate and led me around the outside to the outer gate facing east, and the water was tricking from the south side.” ([Ezekiel 47:1-2 NIV](/en/Bible/47#v1)) 

Figure 20. (opposite) The great river that flowed “East of Eden” through the “peninsular neck” to the mainland and thence across the lowlands of Mesopotamia to the sea beyond. (Described in Ezekiel 47:1-2 and The Urantia Book. From the author’s collection) 

Not only do we find a river mentioned in _Enki and the World Order_ and the Bible, but also in the Urantia text: 

> The coast line of this land mass was considerably elevated, and the neck connecting with the mainland was only twenty-seven miles wide at the narrowest point. The great river that watered the Garden came down from the higher lands of the peninsula and flowed east through the peninsular neck to the mainland and thence across the lowlands of Mesopotamia to the sea beyond. It was fed by four tributaries which took origin in the coastal hills of the Edenic peninsula, and these are the “four heads” of the river which “went out of Eden,” and which later became confused with the branches of the rivers surrounding the second garden. [73.3.4] (P. 823) 

The distance from the central mount to the coast of Syria is about fifty miles. At sometime in the distant past, Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent was presumably higher in elevation than the Syrian coast so that the great river could flow in an easterly direction, according to all accounts. As the African plate was subducting under the Anatolian plate, the whole of the Garden of Eden (or Atlantis if you prefer) sank, and the shore of Syria rose. At some point in this process, part of the river must have reversed it course and begun to flow back into the Mediterranean. That part of the river still remains today in the same place in Syria and still retains its name of old, the Kabir River or translated: the “Great River.”  

## The Brick Builders of Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent 

It must have been the case that the occupants of Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent were master builders with bricks. In Enki and the World Order, the master brick maker was revealed as Kulla and the master builder was called Mucdama; this text also gives the impression that these people had building methods that are in use today. We also saw that according to the Urantia account, bricks were used in numerous ways, as follows:  

> Before the disruption of the Adamic regime, a covered brick-conduit disposal system had been constructed which ran beneath the walls and emptied into the river of Eden almost a mile beyond the outer or lesser wall of the Garden. [73.5.4] (P. 825) 
> 
> The first task was the building of the brick wall across the neck of the peninsula. This once completed, the real work of landscape beautification and home building could proceed unhindered. [73.4.1] (P. 823) 
> 
> At the time of Adam’s arrival, though the Garden was only one-fourth finished, it had thousands of miles of irrigation ditches and more than twelve thousand miles of paved paths and roads. There were a trifle over five thousand brick buildings in the various sectors, and the trees and plants were almost beyond number. [73.5.2] (P. 824) 

The number of bricks required in this account reaches astronomical figures. We are told that the Edenites built houses, roads, sewer conduits, and temples with brick, and even built two 27-mile-long brick walls at the Garden’s entrance (containing the so-called twelve gates of Eden). Other uses of bricks are suggested in _Enki and the World Order_ for the building of waterways, irrigation ditches, and controlling dikes.

The staggering number of bricks that would be required for such an undertaking would require a fairly large industrial area for extracting brick making material, presumably clay, for their manufacture. Consider in this connection the evolution of brick making from the simple mud brick to the kiln-fired brick. Firing the bricks made them water resistant so they could be used for waterways, and this must have been the case in the Urantia version of Eden. 

Why, you may ask, do I pursue this issue of brick making in such detail? Because a survey of the area in the IFREMER bathymetric scans to the north-north-east of the central mound reveals an interesting discovery at some distance from the peninsula’s center. Here we see a large area, apparently excavated from the side of a hill, that displays two angular sides at virtual right angles to one another. I believe this gives the appearance of a quarry. (See Figure 21.) This area was far enough removed from what we believe were the residential, ceremonial, and agricultural areas of Eden so as not to interfere with those functions. Unfortunately, the site in Figure 21 was not visited during either of the 2004 and the 2006 expeditions, but should be one of the targets of a third expedition.  

## Final Thoughts and Conclusions 

Imagine hovering over a verdant and spacious peninsula that juts out into the eastern Mediterranean. Looking down, you see thousands of brick homes and miles of roads crisscrossing a spacious plain that is spread out in front of high mountains. Workers are manufacturing bricks, and others are using kiln-fired bricks to build even more roads and homes, while others are caring for animals and vast gardens or engaged in other communal activities. You can also see the central mount, which is studded with circular shrines and encircled by moats. As you peer out over the vast stretches of the plain, you can see its spider web of canals and ditches, including evidence of a largely underground conduit for a sewage system. You also observe a great tree-lined river flowing just behind the central mount. It is feeding several tributaries and canals and is busy with boats and barges that are engaged in commence or recreation as it flows over the horizon to the distant Persian Gulf. 

I offer this vision, based on The Urantia Book ’s descriptions and other ancient writings, of Eden, for your inspiration. One can fill in many more details from the Urantia account. But for now, we have very basic but rather exciting archeological work to do in a third expedition. 

Perhaps our first step is to consider the idea that the ridges, the visible evidence of the proposed brick conduit system that we have examined, are only a small part of a larger network. In fact, remnants of a system with interconnected conduits may still be in existence throughout Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent. If we continue to follow The Urantia Book ’s account, we could extrapolate the path of the main conduit by drawing a straight line in a northeastly direction. We’ve noted that his would lead to the conduit’s terminus miles away, somewhere near the Kabir River in Syria. If all of this is on the right track, there is an abundance of work to be accomplished in order to find other segments and develop a map of the conduit’s path. Extensive SBP surveys will be required to carry out this part of the research for the new expedition to come. 

Another early step is to solve the nagging puzzle as to why the conduit system appears only at the foot of the mound. One explanation might be that the weight and mass of the mound, during the sinking of the land, created an additional dynamic of upward subterranean pressure in its immediate vicinity. As the mound settled deeper into the landscape with great force, presumably there would be a somewhat greater up-thrust around its base. To illustrate this effect, picture pushing your hand down in a pan full of mud with a steady pressure and observing the mud oozing between your fingers. 

Remember that by all accounts, this area suffered devastating wars in which the remains of a great civilization were destroyed. Then, by happenstance, it eventually sank into the sea. It is unlikely however that invaders would have taken the time, or made the effort, to tear up a drainage system, or fill in a quarry or remove the earthworks of an enlarged central mound to simply conceal its history. In addition, we can expect that artifacts other than those gross features identified in this paper will also be found that would not have been carried off by the warring parties or destroyed by seismic activity. 

Even before the physical evidence described in this essay was analyzed, Sarmast and others had suggested that Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent is the true location of Atlantis as described in Plato’s dialogs in the _Critias_ and the _Timaeus_. But I have taken the additional step of following up on Sarmast’s undisclosed source, and have suggested that it is also the land that was once the biblical Garden of Eden or the so-called First Garden of Eden revealed in _The Urantia Book_. Others, such as the controversial Ignatius Donnelly, also suggested it could be both Eden and Atlantis—even without the benefit of knowing about Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent. Writing in his classic 1882 book, _Atlantis: The Antediluvian World_, he states “...the conclusion becomes irresistible that Atlantis and the Garden of Eden were one and the same.”[^8] He also stated that Atlantis “is not, as has been long supposed, a fable, but veritable history.” For our purposes here it can suffice to call it “Malovitskiy’s _Sunken Continent_ ”—the likely original home of some or all these legends and myths. 

Much to his credit, Robert Sarmast did initiate two elaborate expeditions and did an extensive study to justify why Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent is the only logical place for the origins of the Eden-Atlantis story. In both of his editions of The Discovery of Atlantis, he analyses a plethora of ancient writings and contemporary research to show a one-to-one correspondence between what was present in that area long ago with Plato’s account of what was there. As noted, Sarmast identified nearly 50 “clues” offered by Plato about the characteristics of Atlantis and showed that almost all of them can be linked to Cyprus or to the sunken continent that we explored. 

While on camera during the expedition in 2006, Sarmast and Lowry, unfortunately, were unable to make the case for the man-made remains of an extraordinary civilization. The analysis in this essay, taken together with the literary work of Sarmast and others, is intended to close that gap by giving a revised and more accurate geophysical study of Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent. It is amazing that humankind’s picture of this civilization shows up in stories that are thousands of years apart and in civilizations that span the globe: _Enki and the World Order_ (over 5,000 years ago), _Vishnu Purana_, a Sanskrit text (over 4,000 years ago), Moses’ story in the Bible (over 3,400 years ago), Plato’s story of Atlantis as received from Solon (over 2,400 years ago), Manetho of Sebennytos translated Egyptian king’s list (2,250 years ago), Ignatius Donnelly’s _Atlantis: The Antediluvian World_ (120 years ago), and The Urantia Book (63 years ago). Yet, this essay only scratches the surface of the evidence we now have of relatively advanced prehistoric cultures. 

Plans for the third expedition include many additional side-scan and SBP surveys. It should also involve probing the area with a coring device to retrieve samples below the silt, and maybe a visit with a specialized submarine. The search for possible ruins on the tabular mound should also be under consideration for an expedition to this place. The plans for a new expedition also could include a submersible remote operating vehicle (ROV) to examine other sites on Malovitskiy’s Sunken Continent with even more sophisticated equipment. So far, this location seems to be the best bet for the Edenic-Atlantean myths of old. Only through future expeditions will this hypothesis about an undiscovered archaeological treasure trove of this mythical land be validated, once and for all.
