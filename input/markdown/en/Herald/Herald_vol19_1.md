#### Summer Study Session 2019

**Experiencing God's Presence**

```
It's Summer Study Session time again! A Fellowship tradition
since 1963 the Summer Study Session has provided readers with
the opportunity to present and participate in high quality
workshops, prayerful meditation, and the joy of fellowship. Once
again this year readers have planned a variety of intensive
workshops for experienced students and an “Introduction to The Urantia Book ” for new or
non-readers. The Education Committee has incorporated a new format for this summer's
program. In addition to the self-contained workshops, there will be short talks followed by
small groups who will stay together to discuss focused questions. These talks and question-
driven discussions will explore the conference theme aligned with strong educational
principles.
This year's plenary speakers, Elisabeth Callahan, Angie Thurston, Mike MacIsaac, and Avi
Dogim will share insights about experiencing God's presence through study, socialization,
service, and spiritual communion. The evening plenary sessions will open with short
worshipful experiences to provide attendees with exposure to “...other religious experiences
(the diverse interpretations of other and diverse mortals) to the end that you may prevent
your religious life from becoming egocentric—circumscribed, selfish, and
unsocial.” (103:1.3) The worship program will conclude on Sunday morning with a Urantia
Book inspired ceremony – an invitation to worship. Although we can't begin to imagine
worship on Paradise “...the spirit of it you can begin to appreciate even down here on
Urantia, for the spirits of the Gods even now indwell you, hover over you, and inspire you to
true worship.” (27:7.5)
Saturday night socials are always special. At the Summer Study Session in 2015, we
enjoyed a celebration of the 60th anniversary of the publishing of The Urantia Book and the
beginning of Urantia Brotherhood. Those who attended SSS18 will remember non-stop
laughter during the party that included the “Apostles’ “Musical Chairs.” This year’s Saturday
Evening Social is dedicated to our Universe Mother Spirit and the 50th anniversary of the
first moon landing! Plan to be there to discover the relationship! The Reversion Directors
envision short talks, videos, humor and great refreshments.
Pre-conference events include a spiritual retreat “Getting to Know Your Spiritual Parents,”
with Kaye and Bill Cooper, Sharon Porter and Mary Huggins, meeting from Tuesday, June
25 th at dinner to Thursday, June 27th at noon, and a Society Conclave scheduled on
Thursday, June 25th. After the conference the Fellowship's General Council will meet from
Sunday, June 25th after lunch through Tuesday, June 2nd at noon. Visitors are welcome to
observe.

_By Meredith Tenney,
Ackworth, New
Hampshire_
For most of us,
adjuster fusion seems
a distant and
unobtainable dream;
an unreachable, lofty
goal that is not
achievable within this
lifetime. Many
consider it hardly
worth thinking about
adjuster fusion, much less working towards it,
believing that accomplishing this divine
objective would require a millennium at least.
We dismiss the magnificent potential for union
with our thought adjusters as an egoistic
fantasy that is too unlikely to waste time
contemplating, rather than the path to eternal
salvation each of us is invited to take. Because
union with our adjusters is generally
considered impossible in this lifetime, there is a
dearth of workshops or discussions that focus
on the steps to adjuster fusion, yet it is not an
implausible dream, and is more within reach
than we realize.

Our celestial family believes the promotion
of adjuster fusion in furtherance of the
ascension plan is one of the most important
functions of the universe. Consider the
following quote from Paper 77:

```
77:9.12 The entire organization of high
spirits, angelic hosts, and midway fellows is
enthusiastically devoted to the furtherance
of the Paradise plan for the progressive
ascension and perfection attainment of
evolutionary mortals, one of the supernal
businesses of the universe—the superb
survival plan of bringing God down to man
and then, by a sublime sort of partnership,
carrying man up to God and on to eternity
of service and divinity of attainment—alike
for mortal and midwayer.
In Paper 110, a Solitary Messenger laments
```
```
that we do not pursue the goal of fusion more
persistently:
110:3.4 I cannot but observe that so many
of you spend so much time and thought on
mere trifles of living, while you almost
wholly overlook the more essential realities
of everlasting import, those very
accomplishments which are concerned with
the development of a more harmonious
working agreement between you and your
Adjusters. The great goal of human
existence is to attune to the divinity of the
indwelling Adjuster; the great achievement
of mortal life is the attainment of a true and
understanding consecration to the eternal
aims of the divine spirit who waits and
works within your mind.
Our Thought Adjusters, too, are dedicated
to leading us to fusion. We are told that the
great days in the career of an adjuster are first
when the mortal subject breaks through the
third psychic circle ensuring the Monitor’s
increased range of functioning, then when the
human partner attains the first psychic circle
enabling at least some degree of
intercommunication, and last, when final and
eternal fusion occurs. Only in this way do we
receive eternal life, and our Thought Adjusters
achieve personality. What more vital objective
is there?
FORERUNNERS
While a lofty goal, adjuster fusion in this
lifetime, or shortly after our arrival on the
Mansion Worlds, may be more possible than we
realize. Enoch was the first mortal on Urantia
to achieve fusion in the flesh. He was the son of
Jared, and a sixth generation descendant of
Adam and Eve living in the second Garden. The
Bible says Enoch lived 365 years before he was
taken by God. The text reads that Enoch
‘walked with God and was no more, for God
took him’ (Genesis 5: 21-24). Hebrews 11:
reports, “By faith Enoch was translated that he
should not see death, and was not found,
because God had translated him: for before his
```
Following In The Footsteps Of Enoch And Elijah:

The Path To Adjuster Fusion


translation he had this testimony, that he
pleased God.” _The Urantia Book_ does not give
us much information about Enoch, but it does
confirm what the Bible says by describing him
as 45:4.13 "the first of the mortals of Urantia to
fuse with the Thought Adjuster during the
mortal life in the flesh."

The prophet Elijah was the second
individual to leave our world by fusion. The
Urantia Book extols him as 97:9:19 "one of the
greatest of the prophets," and 45:4:15 "a
translated soul of brilliant spiritual
achievement during the post-Material Son age."
In the Book of Kings in the Bible, Elijah is
described as a prophet and a miracle worker
who entered Heaven alive “by fire.” _The
Urantia Book_ informs us that as a result of
their spiritual leadership, Enoch and Elijah
currently sit on the Council of 24. (45:4:15) One
advantage enjoyed by both was a higher
concentration of undiluted violet blood than
any of us have today, as, according to the Bible,
they were direct descendants from Adam's line.
This genetic inheritance also afforded them
longer lives, making it easier to fuse within
their lifetimes. We, however, have the Fifth
Epochal Revelation, and thus have information
about the ascension scheme and the purpose of
adjuster fusion that they may have lacked.
Enoch and Elijah dispel forever the notion that
only Jesus, a superhuman Son of God, could
possibly fuse during this mortal life.

When Jesus of Nazareth went down into the
Jordan to be baptized, he was a mortal of the
realm who had attained the 136:2:2 "pinnacle of
human self-identification with the spirit." _The
Urantia Book_ also tells us that He stood in the
Jordan a perfected mortal, having developed
"perfect synchrony and full communication
with his indwelling spirit adjuster," and he
accomplished all of this by the age of 31.
(136:2:2) Of course, Michael, our Creator Son,
had no need of fusion, but the human Jesus was
given an experience as equivalent to fusion as
an incarnation of God-made-man could have
had. He, John, and Jesus' two brothers, heard a
voice from on high say 136:2.4 "This is my beloved
Son in whom I am well pleased." After his
baptism, Jesus departed for 40 days of
seclusion to determine how to proceed.

```
A similar event awaits all candidates for
adjuster fusion. Paper 47 informs us that when
the union between an evolving soul and the
divine adjuster is imminent, an archangel
announces "This is a beloved son in whom I am
well pleased" in the presence of the candidate's
associates. After this short ceremony, the
individual is granted forty days of spiritual
retirement to choose from among the various
paths to Havona. Perhaps the human Jesus was
given a similar experience in the flesh so that he
could better understand the experience of
ascending mortals and model the way for those
who would follow him.
It is hard to know how many, if any, other
mortals have fused since Enoch and Elijah. If
there have been a number, it certainly hasn’t
been reported in the news. However, it’s also
plausible that those eligible for fusion have
elected to stay on the planet as long as possible
to help out on earth, even as the human Jesus
remained here after attaining 'perfect
synchrony with his indwelling spirit adjuster' to
complete his mission. Also, we are told some
mortals of Adjuster-fusion status are exempted
from translation to continue in important
administrative posts. (55:3.13) Others, may be
held in waiting as ‘adjuster fusion candidates’,
those who have reached betrothal status with
their thought adjusters, but have not yet
actually fused. The Urantia Book describes this
in Paper 109:
109.2.4 3. [The adjuster] has a subject who
has made the supreme decision, has entered
into a solemn and sincere betrothal with the
Adjuster. The Adjuster looks beforehand to
the time of actual fusion and reckons the
union as an event of fact.
52:7:4 More and more humans will fuse as
our sphere approaches Light and Life; we
are informed that natural death becomes
less frequent as the Adjusters increasingly
fuse with their subjects during the lifetime
in the flesh.
This doesn't mean we as individuals have to
wait until Light and Life to begin striving for
fusion. The more mortals that advance in that
direction, or successfully fuse, the closer to
Light and Life we will all become.
```

**WHY STRIVE FOR ADJUSTER FUSION
NOW?**
The more sluggard among us may conclude
there is little point in working for something
now that can be done later on the mansion
worlds, but regardless of how many mortals
have succeeded, or what status they may be in,
there can be little doubt that achieving adjuster
fusion status while still on earth is of great
assistance to the divine plan and our brothers
and sisters. Not only does such a soul-satisfying
accomplishment ensure your own survival and
participation in the ascension scheme, it
pleases God and optimizes your chances of
effectively serving Michael and Mother while
here. The more in harmony any of us are with
God, the greater the positive spiritual impact
we can have on society. Because of their
detailed knowledge about fusion, _Urantia Book_
readers have the potential to be modern
forerunners by furthering their own individual
inner union with God, and thereby facilitate
humanity's eventual collective attainment of
Light and Life. In intimate conversations with
members of several different Urantian circles,
this author has encountered a number of
individuals who believe they have reached high
levels of ongoing spiritual attunement with
their adjusters. They consider themselves
candidates for adjuster fusion, have
experienced having that status affirmed by
their adjusters, and are living their lives
accordingly. Hopefully, this article will inspire
individuals who have had similar experiences to
feel more comfortable in sharing them with
others so that all of us can grow in our
awareness that such an achievement is both
desirable and possible. Such sharing about
personal spiritual experiences regarding the
journey towards fusion could also facilitate
each other's mutual growth on the path.

**IDENTIFYING** **_YOUR PROGRESS
TOWARDS FUSION_**
_The Urantia Book_ offers a wealth of
information about the necessary spiritual levels
that must be achieved to reach fusion.
Identifying where you are in that structured
progression may help inspire and encourage
you to continue to make progress. How can you

```
ascertain your own progress towards fusion?
We are told that fusion generally occurs on
Mansion World #5 or #6, and are given an
accurate description of the spiritual levels and
accomplishments required to master each of
the Mansion World levels prior to that.
Mansion World #1 is almost entirely devoted to
deficiency ministry. Survivors arriving on this
sphere present with manifold defects of
creature character and deficiencies of mortal
experience. Biologic deficiencies are addressed
on the first mansion world, and major defects
in planetary experience pertaining to sex life,
family association, and parental function, are
either corrected or projected for future
rectification among the Material Son families
on Jerusem.
For those who have issues with rudimentary
social skills, on Mansion World #2, working
groups and social organizations begin to form
and survivors learn social interaction.
Mansonia #2 provides for the removal of
```
```
My Thought Adjuster by Patrick Yesh
```

intellectual conflict and cures all varieties of
mental disharmony. The training of the first
two mansion worlds is mostly of a deficiency
nature in that it has to do with supplementing
the experience of the life in the flesh.

Mansonia #3 is the sphere where positive
educational work is begun. Survivors learn
progressive morontia culture, enhance their
understanding of the correlation of morontia
mota and mortal logic, and gain practical
insight into metaphysics. Ascending mortals
are taught cosmic meanings and
interrelationships, and are becoming ‘born of
the spirit’, i.e., discovering God within
themselves, and becoming God conscious.

Ascenders on the 4th mansion world are
introduced to a new social order based on
understanding sympathy and unselfish love of
mutual service, rather than one predicated on
personal aggrandizement or self-seeking
conquest. They develop an increased
appreciation of the broadcasts and other phases
of local universe culture, and are becoming self-
conscious of God knowing, God-revealing, God-
seeking and God-finding.

On mansion world #5, sojourners are taught
the language of Uversa. A real birth of cosmic
consciousness takes place, and pilgrims become
universe minded with a bona fide enthusiasm
for the Havona ascent. Study becomes
voluntary, unselfish service natural, and
worship spontaneous.

```
The sixth mansion world is devoted to initial
```
```
instruction on universe administration, and an
overview of career paths, and is the sphere
where the perfect fusion of the human and the
divine Adjuster usually occurs. On that glorious
day which guarantees our eternal survival:
47:8.4 The union of the evolving immortal
soul with the eternal and divine Adjuster is
signalized by the seraphic summoning of the
supervising superangel for resurrected
survivors and of the archangel of record for
those going to judgment on the third day;
and then, in the presence of such a
survivor’s morontia associates, these
messengers of confirmation speak: ‘This is a
beloved son in whom I am well pleased.’
This simple ceremony marks the entrance of
an ascending mortal upon the eternal career
of Paradise service.
It is not difficult to analyze the
requirements for passage from one mansion
world to the next, look within to honestly
appraise your progress, and by this means
approximate your personal spiritual growth
and mansion world level. Taking a look at the
chart below may help with your own self-
assessment. The chart is over simplified and
doesn’t attempt to reflect the complexity and
comprehensive nature of decisions made in
advancing mortals from one mansion world to
the next, but can assist in estimating your
progress.
If you regularly seek out God and
opportunities for service, have developed a
sense of universe citizenship, and love to
worship spontaneously, and study the Urantia
Book, you exhibit many of the character
attributes of Mansion World #5, and may be
```

```

closer to fusion than you realize. Of course, you
can wait until you reach the Mansion Worlds to
address the issues that may be hindering your
advancement, or you can constructively use
your time on earth to make progress now. Our
thought adjusters have individualized plans to
help us advance and grow spiritually, and we
may be assured that they are eager to aid us to
move towards fusion.

**MANSION WORLDS AND THEIR
FUNCTIONS**
Mansion World #1 To correct biologic
deficiencies, defects in sex life, family life, or
parenting skills

Mansion World #2 To ameliorate mental
disharmonies and improve limited social skills

Mansion World #3 To develop God
consciousness in those who haven't found God
in themselves

Mansion World #4 To increase desire for
God and cultivate greater sympathy and a love
of service

Mansion World #5 To foster cosmic
consciousness and a voluntary desire for
worship.

Mansion World #6 To facilitate greater
alignment with the divine will and fusion

**STRIVING FOR FUSION**
If reading about the success of Enoch and
Elijah, hearing about the experiences of others,
and identifying your own progress thus far,
inspires you to work towards fusion the
following suggestions about adjuster
attunement found in Paper 110 of _The Urantia
Book_ may be helpful:

- Choose to respond to divine leading,
basing your life on your highest consciousness
of truth, beauty, and goodness.
- Love God and desire to be like him.
- Love men and sincerely try to serve them.
- Joyfully accept your cosmic citizenship
and universe duties.

Further strategies might include developing
a daily habit of praying for help in pleasing your
adjuster and your divine parents. Take the

```
Kingdom by storm, calling in all the divine
assistance from your guardian angels and the
midwayers and other members of our celestial
family that are available to you, knowing they
will be eager to help. Read over Jesus’ sermon
on ‘Counting the Cost ’ and then practice
seeking to align your will with the divine will in
every situation. Commit yourself to making
your best effort to do whatever you believe God
wants, even if it means risking your personal
finances, the approval of your family, your
social standing, and your own personal desires.
Jesus says:
171:.2.2 “You who would follow after me
from this time on, must be willing to pay the
price of wholehearted dedication to the
doing of my Father’s will. If you would be
my disciples, you must be willing to forsake
father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and
sisters. If any one of you would now be my
disciple, you must be willing to give up even
your life just as the Son of Man is about to
offer up his life for the completion of the
mission of doing the Father’s will on earth
and in the flesh.”

Don offers a compelling argument for
pursuing adjuster fusion, and gave a dynamic
presentation on the subject at Urantia Book
Service Corps of New England's spring retreat
a year ago.
Fellow readers pursuing their quest for
fusion may want to consider a visit or retreat at
Prior Rev. Dr. Robert Crickett’s ‘St. Enoch and
St. Elijah Monastery’ in New Zealand. The 55
acre property is an exquisite botanical garden
with a winding drive commemorating Enoch
```

and Elijah, and many other spiritual leaders
mentioned in the Urantia Book. The Prior
endeavors to assist his visitors in attaining
greater attunement with God within, and guests
have ample time for daily prayer, study,
meditation, and reflection. Immersion in such a
spiritually rich environment can help
individuals find the answers they seek, bring
them closer to God, and nurture their spiritual
growth. For further information, contact the
monastery at rob@sffj.org.

**CONCLUSION**
If we could clearly hear the voices of our
Thought Adjusters, they would exhort us
towards fusion, reminding us that:

110:1.6 Today you are passing through the
period of the courtship of your Adjuster;
and if you only prove faithful to the trust
reposed in you by the divine spirit who
seeks your mind and soul in eternal union,
there will eventually ensue that morontia
oneness, that supernal harmony, that
cosmic co-ordination, that divine
attunement, that celestial fusion, that never-
ending blending of identity, that oneness of
being which is so perfect and final that even
the most experienced personalities can
never segregate or recognize as separate
identities the fusion partners—mortal man
and divine Adjuster.
Even though Jesus ministered in an age
before many people on earth had adjusters, he
taught his followers that the
Kingdom of Heaven was within.
Two thousand years have passed
since then, and now every normal
minded person has an adjuster.
The time is ripe for believers to
understand that not only does the
Kingdom of Heaven lie within,
but so too, the door to eternal life
through union with our adjusters,
and a supernal adventure beyond
our imagining.

```
101:10.9 ... At last all
creatures become conscious of
the fact that God and all the
divine hosts of a well-nigh
```
```
limitless universe are on their side in the
supernal struggle to attain eternity of life
and divinity of status. Such faith-liberated
sons have certainly enlisted in the struggles
of time on the side of the supreme forces
and divine personalities of eternity; even the
stars in their courses are now doing battle
for them; at last they gaze upon the universe
from within, from God's viewpoint, and all
is transformed from the uncertainties of
material isolation to the sureties of eternal
spiritual progression.

The Inevitable (and Necessary) ‘Organized Religion’

Based on _The Urantia Book_

_by Philip G
Calabrese_
**1) INDIVIDUAL
VS. ORGANIZED
RELIGION**
People familiar with
_The Urantia Book_
(the URANTIA
BOOK ) recognize
two important
meanings of the
word “religion.”
There is the
“personal religion”
of each individual as distinguished from the
“organized religions” of the world, such as
Vedicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism,
Christianity, and Islam, to chronologically list a
few of the larger groupings of individual
religionists. Each of these organized Religions
(I’ll capitalize the word Religion when
returning to them) admit sub-classes such as
the division of Christianity into many
“denominations” - Catholic, Protestant,
Southern Baptists and so many more. What
does _The Urantia Book_ itself say about
organized religion? Well, it’s complicated! We
read:

```
98:6.1 Prior to the coming of the mystery
cults and Christianity, personal religion
hardly developed as an independent
institution in the civilized lands of North
Africa and Europe; it was more of a family,
city-state, political, and imperial affair. The
Hellenic Greeks never evolved a centralized
worship system; the ritual was local; they
had no priesthood and no “sacred book.”
Much as the Romans, their religious
institutions lacked a powerful driving
agency for the preservation of higher moral
and spiritual values. While it is true that the
institutionalization of religion has usually
detracted from its spiritual quality, it is also
a fact that no religion has thus far succeeded
in surviving without the aid of institutional
```
```
organization of some degree, greater or
lesser.
Before the mystery cults and Christianity,
religion was more of a group affair (family, city-
state, political or imperial) than a personal
relationship with God.
The religious institutions of the Hellenic
Greeks, much as the Romans:
```
- lacked a powerful driving agency for
    the preservation of higher moral and
    spiritual values
- had no centralized worship system
- the ritual was local
- had no priesthood
- had no “sacred book”
    **2) ORGANIZED RELIGION**
“Institutionalization of religion has usually
detracted from its spiritual quality” but
“ **without the aid of institutional
organization of some degree, greater or
lesser” “no religion has thus far
succeeded in surviving.** ” Obviously, to be of
lasting value to the world a religion must
survive in some form.
103:5.11 ...Spiritual growth is greatest
where all external pressures are at a
minimum. “Where the spirit of the Lord is,
there is freedom.” Man develops best when
the pressures of home, community, church,
and state are least. **But this must not be
construed as meaning that there is no
place in a progressive society for
home, social institutions, church, and
state.**
103:5.12 When a member of a social
religious group has complied with the
requirements of such a group, he should be
encouraged to enjoy religious liberty in the
full expression of his own personal
interpretation of the truths of religious
belief and the facts of religious experience.


```
The security of a religious group depends on
spiritual unity, not on theological
uniformity. A religious group should be able
to enjoy the liberty of freethinking without
having to become “freethinkers.” There is
great hope for any church that worships the
living God, validates the brotherhood of
man, and dares to remove all creedal
pressure from its members.
Notice that almost any believing Jew,
Christian or Muslim could technically affirm
these same three principles and be a member of
such an organized religion! Whether to name
the local groups of this religion churches,
temples, or mosques, could be left to individual
congregations.
3) THE NEED FOR BALANCE
Clearly a balance is needed between having
no “organized religion” at all versus having one
that is over-organized. Is there a happy
medium? We need to be neither too timid nor
too bold about this issue. Consider these words
of Jesus:
149:4.3 On this same occasion the
Master...called attention to the fact that any
virtue, if carried to extremes, may become a
vice. ...He pointed out that overmuch
sympathy and pity may degenerate into
serious emotional instability; that
```
```
enthusiasm may drive on into fanaticism.
He discussed one of their former associates
whose imagination had led him off into
visionary and impractical undertakings. At
the same time, he warned them against the
dangers of the dullness of over-conservative
mediocrity.
149:4.4 And then Jesus discoursed on the
dangers of courage and faith, how they
sometimes lead unthinking souls on to
recklessness and presumption. He also
showed how prudence and discretion, when
carried too far, lead to cowardice and
failure. He exhorted his hearers to strive for
originality while they shunned all tendency
toward eccentricity. He pleaded for
sympathy without sentimentality, piety
without sanctimoniousness. He taught
reverence free from fear and superstition.
4) SURVIVAL OF THE JEWISH
RELIGION
Consider that:
97:10.7 The Jewish religion persisted also
because of its institutions. It is difficult for
religion to survive as the private practice of
isolated individuals. This has ever been the
error of the religious leaders: Seeing the
evils of institutionalized religion, they seek
to destroy the technique of group
functioning. In place of destroying all ritual,
they would do better to reform it. In this
respect Ezekiel was wiser than his
contemporaries; though he joined with
them in insisting on personal moral
responsibility, he also set about to establish
the faithful observance of a superior and
purified ritual.
5) RELIGIOUS REFORMATIONS
Despite “the evils of institutionalized
religion” it is an error to seek to “destroy the
technique of group functioning.” Religious
“group functioning” is organized religion –
Religion with the capital R. Hear The Urantia
Book :
```
97:10.7 (^) “In place of destroying all ritual,
they would do better to reform it.”
Let us then 97:10.7 “Set about to establish the
Shutterstock


```
faithful observance of a superior and purified
ritual” along with “insisting on personal moral
responsibility.”
In light of The Urantia Book, we are now in
a position to do just that with the Christian
ritual. There is much of value in the ritual of a
Christian church service to adopt in a Urantia
Book church.
In my own local United Church of Christ
(UCC) parish, the sequence of events last
Sunday and typically is: Music, Announcements
& Welcome, Prelude (music – piano or organ),
Call to Worship (recitation by One & All),
Group Hymn, Prayer of Confession and
Assurance of Forgiveness, Special Music (choir
or solo), Children’s Chat (& church school
class), Joys & Concerns (a chance for anyone
present to briefly address those assembled),
Prayers for our church family & The Lord’s
Prayer, Friendship Greetings, Hymn, Scripture,
Sermon, Offertory (with music), Choral
Response, Prayer of Dedication, Closing Hymn,
Benediction, Sending Forth and Sharing the
Light (music), Postlude (music as people leave).
Afterwards, there was coffee etc. with social
contact. And this was just the Sunday service
without the monthly “Remembrance ritual of
bread and grape juice.” There are many other
social services of members to members and to
the community at large.
In a reformation of the Christian ritual, the
Remembrance Supper (the communion ritual)
could undergo reform to eliminate all notions
```
of blood sacrifice to God for the forgiveness of
sins. The true reasons for the crucifixion could
be mentioned as part of the remembrance
ritual. It is Jesus’ “life in the flesh” that is “the
bread of eternal life.”
Since he demonstrated that a human could
also be divine, we too can become divine. We
can become perfect in our realm even as the
Paradise Father is perfect in his domain. The
sacramental cup of wine is “the emblem of a
new dispensation of grace and truth,” not a
symbolic blood sacrifice.
**6) A BALANCED EVOLUTION OF
RITUAL**
87:7.2 From the dawn of civilization every
appealing movement in social culture or
religious advancement has developed a
ritual, a symbolic ceremonial. The more this
ritual has been an unconscious growth, the
stronger it has gripped its devotees. The cult
preserved sentiment and satisfied emotion,
but it has always been the greatest obstacle
to social reconstruction and spiritual
progress.
A Urantia Religion should “preserve
sentiment and satisfy emotion” but not be an
“obstacle to social reconstruction and spiritual
progress.”
To be more of an unconscious growth than a
conscious one, the formal structure must be
very simple and open-ended, allowing for a
variety of innovative or spontaneous
expressions. Some will catch on and others not.
87:7.6 Regardless of the drawbacks and
handicaps, every new revelation of truth has
given rise to a new cult, and even the
restatement of the religion of Jesus must
develop a new and appropriate symbolism.
Modern man must find some adequate
symbolism for his new and expanding ideas,
ideals, and loyalties. This enhanced symbol
must arise out of religious living, spiritual
experience. And this higher symbolism of a
higher civilization must be predicated on
the concept of the Fatherhood of God and
be pregnant with the mighty ideal of the
brotherhood of man.
It is important to remember that the
Corbis


connotation of the word “cult” has changed
since _The Urantia Book_ used it in the early
1990s. Then it referred to a religious culture.
Nowadays the word “cult” connotes a group
whose members are strongly dominated by the
organization, usually by one person – as in a
“personality cult.”

**7) AN EXPANDED SYMBOLISM**
“The restatement of the religion of Jesus
must develop a new and appropriate
symbolism” for “our expanding ideas, ideals,
and loyalties.”

87:7.6 This enhanced symbol must arise
out of religious living, spiritual experience...
And this higher symbolism of a higher
civilization must be predicated on the
concept of the Fatherhood of God and be
pregnant with the mighty ideal of the
brotherhood of man.”
Religious living requires social interactions
with God and one’s fellows. That is only
possible via close social contact such as occurs
in a good family, church, temple or mosque.

Expanding ideas of the cosmos, ideals of
universe citizenship, the indwelling, pre-
personal Thought Adjusters that make us
spiritually equal, loyalties to the Paradise
Father and the Creator Son - these mysteries
must be symbolized.

```
87:7.7 The old cults were too egocentric;
the new must be the outgrowth of applied
love. The new cult must, like the old, foster
sentiment, satisfy emotion, and promote
loyalty; but it must do more: It must
facilitate spiritual progress, enhance cosmic
meanings, augment moral values, encourage
social development, and stimulate a high
type of personal religious living. The new
cult must provide supreme goals of living
which are both temporal and eternal—social
and spiritual.
87:7.8 No cult can endure and contribute
to the progress of social civilization and
individual spiritual attainment unless it is
based on the biologic, sociologic, and
religious significance of the home. A
surviving cult must symbolize that which is
permanent in the presence of unceasing
```
```
change; it must glorify that which unifies
the stream of ever-changing social
metamorphosis. It must recognize true
meanings, exalt beautiful relations, and
glorify the good values of real nobility.
Did you get all of that? The expanded
Urantia Religion would need to:
a) foster sentiment
b) satisfy emotion
c) promote loyalty
d) facilitate spiritual progress
e) enhance cosmic meanings
f) augment moral values
g) encourage social development
h) stimulate a high type of personal
religious living
i) provide supreme goals of living, both
temporal and eternal, social & spiritual
j) be based on the biologic, sociologic,
and religious significance of the home
k) symbolize that which is permanent in
the presence of unceasing change
l) glorify what unifies the stream of ever-
changing social metamorphosis
m) recognize true meanings, exalt
beautiful relations, & glorify noble values
This is a tall order. And that’s not all.
8) HUMAN DESIRE FOR SCIENCE AND
MYSTERY
87:7.9 But the great difficulty of finding a
new and satisfying symbolism is because
modern men, as a group, adhere to the
scientific attitude, eschew superstition, and
abhor ignorance, while as individuals they
all crave mystery and venerate the
unknown. No cult can survive unless it
embodies some masterful mystery and
conceals some worthful unattainable. Again,
the new symbolism must not only be
significant for the group but also
meaningful to the individual. The forms of
any serviceable symbolism must be those
which the individual can carry out on his
```

own initiative, and which he can
also enjoy with his fellows. If the
new cult could only be dynamic
instead of static, it might really
contribute something
worthwhile to the progress of
mankind, both temporal and
spiritual.
A new and satisfying symbolism
must:

n) be scientifically plausible,
and yet
o) satisfy individual craving
for mystery and exploration of
the unknown,
p) embody some masterful mystery and
conceal some worthwhile unattainable,
q) be designed to be carried out
individually as well as being enjoyed with
one’s fellows,
r) be dynamic rather than static in order
to really make a temporal & spiritual
difference
**9) COMPLEXITY VS. SIMPLICITY**
Despite all these requirements, the ritual
must be simple:

```
87:7.10 But a cult—a symbolism of rituals,
slogans, or goals—will not function if it is
too complex. And there must be the demand
for devotion, the response of loyalty. Every
effective religion unerringly develops a
worthy symbolism, and its devotees would
do well to prevent the crystallization of such
a ritual into cramping, deforming, and
stifling stereotyped ceremonials which can
only handicap and retard all social, moral,
and spiritual progress. No cult can survive if
it retards moral growth and fails to foster
spiritual progress. The cult is the skeletal
structure around which grows the living and
dynamic body of personal spiritual
experience—true religion.
A symbolism of rituals, slogans, or goals”
s) will not function if it is too complex,
and it
```
```
t) must include the demand for devotion,
the response of loyalty
10) URANTIA BOOK BASED
ORGANIZED RELIGION
It seems pretty clear that the revelation of
The Urantia Book needs to find expression and
social survival in an institutional Religion with
a progressive ritual.
We must set about to establish the faithful
observance of a superior and purified ritual that
embodies the values listed above.
89:9.4 And so, after long ages the cult of
the sacrifice has evolved into the cult of the
sacrament. Thus are the sacraments of
modern religions the legitimate successors
of those shocking early ceremonies of
human sacrifice and the still earlier
cannibalistic rituals. Many still depend
upon blood for salvation, but it has at least
become figurative, symbolic, and mystic.
And the mystery that we all seek is the
experience of God:
2:1.6 The Universal Father is absolutely
and without qualification infinite in all his
attributes; and this fact, in and of itself,
automatically shuts him off from all direct
personal communication with finite
material beings and other lowly created
intelligences.
2:1.7 And all this necessitates such
arrangements for contact and
communication with his manifold creatures
as have been ordained, first, in the
```
```
Shutterstock
```

personalities of the Paradise Sons of God,
who, although perfect in divinity, also often
partake of the nature of the very flesh and
blood of the planetary races, becoming one
of you and one with you; thus, as it were,
God becomes man, as occurred in the
bestowal of Michael, who was called
interchangeably the Son of God and the Son
of Man. And second, there are the
personalities of the Infinite Spirit, the
various orders of the seraphic hosts and
other celestial intelligences who draw near
to the material beings of lowly origin and in
so many ways minister to them and serve
them. And third, there are the pre-personal
Mystery Monitors, Thought Adjusters, the
actual gift of the great God himself sent to
indwell such as the humans of Urantia, sent
without announcement and without
explanation. In endless profusion they
descend from the heights of glory to grace
and indwell the humble minds of those
mortals who possess the capacity for God-
consciousness or the potential therefore.
**11) DIFFICULTIES TO OVERCOME**
Among the apparent difficulties to this
program there are:

```
A) Resistance of present organized
Religions and Christian denominations to
The Urantia Book
B) Disinterest of young people in
Religion
C) Lack of a fixed international physical
center where Urantia Book readers can
periodically gather
D) Lack of sufficient Urantia Book
reader density in most geographic locales to
populate a local church
E) Too few very effective leaders
F) Resistance to a new Remembrance
ritual
G) Division of the Urantia Book
Readership into the Urantia Book
Fellowship and the subsequently organized
Urantia Association International. (The 5-
member Urantia Foundation, original
holder of the copyright of the Book and
```
```
present trademark holder of the name
“Urantia” and the tri-concentric symbol,
authorizes use of these trademarks by UAI
but not by the Fellowship, which publishes
its own essentially identical English
version.”
H) The tendency to over-organize
(institutionalize) religion into turf-
competing groups
12) A PRAYER FOR UNITY
May we all experience the presence of the
Spirit of Truth of the Creator Son;
May we all experience our angels, sister
personalities of the Infinite Spirit; May we all
experience our Mystery Monitors, our Thought
Adjusters, the actual divine gifts of the great
Father-Mother-Self of Paradise, sent to indwell
the minds of us humans of Urantia and become
our fusion partners, if we choose to accept the
ascendant life of forever loving God & each
Other.
INFINITY exists; INFINITY exists in Us;
And We exist in INFINITY. Alleluia!
```
```
Appendix. Implications of the above
Specifications when taken as Postulates.
Let us attempt to satisfy the constraints
generated by the sets of all the URANTIA
BOOK statements above and see what kind of
social structure can possibly meet them all.
Some of the postulates such as items 7) a)
through h) can easily be imagined satisfied in
almost any good Urantia Book Religion (UBR).
Others of these postulates like 7) i) through r)
and especially j) impose greater constraints
that appear even to eliminate some social
frameworks for a Urantia Book Religion: The
UBR must be based on the “biologic, sociologic,
and religious significance of the home. ” How
can that be satisfied? Does a Christian church
automatically satisfy this postulate? Probably
not.
The postulates listed under 8) are even
more restrictive, especially q) and r): To satisfy
q) the UBR ritual (satisfying symbolism) must
be such that an individual can carry it out and
```

also enjoy doing it with fellow church members.

Postulate r) under section 8) assumes that
the “satisfying symbolism” of the UBR can be
**_dynamic_** , rather than **_static_** , and that this is
especially desirable for human progress in time
and eternity. How can a ritual, something
repeated, not be static but rather dynamic?

Earlier under 7) are mentioned the
following significant constraints for the
symbolism:

87:7.6 This enhanced symbol must arise
out of religious living, spiritual experience.
Huh? The symbol must arise out of religious
living, spiritual experience?

```
87:7.6 And this higher symbolism of a
higher civilization must be predicated on
the concept of the Fatherhood of God and
```
```
be pregnant with the mighty ideal of the
brotherhood of man.
What context can possibly satisfy all of these
constraints? Here is one dynamic possibility:
Have periodic ‘Celebrations of the Indwelling
Spirits of God’ by inviting our neighbors and
friends to our homes (or church) for a family
meal and a ritual Remembrance of the presence
of Jesus as the spirit of Truth. Individual
expressions could then promote an evolution of
the symbolism.

**Introduction**
Life, human life,
begins at conception.
103:2.1 “A child has
been in existence for
about nine months
before it experiences
birth.” This statement
by a Melchizedek of
Nebadon is also supported and inferred by a
Solitary Messenger of Orvonton who states that
Thought Adjusters (TAs) volunteer and forecast
the intimate natures of the minds they
volunteer to indwell. (108:2.1) Embryologists,
scientists that study this for a living,
acknowledge that life begins at conception.
Further support is provided by the midwayer
commission where Gabriel made his
appearance to Mary the following day after
conception, which has led some UB students to
conclude, erroneously, and make the claim that
personality is bestowed at conception.
Personality is bestowed, along with the
personality circuit **when a child ascends to
the Universe Level of moral
discernment**. (2:2.6, 5:6.6) The
metamorphosing process and prerequisite for
the bestowal of personality with the personality
circuit is peppered throughout this paper. (All
**Bold** my emphasis)

This paper posits that the revelators of the
Urantia Book (Urantia 1955) consider an
understanding of “personality” used
throughout the papers vitally important –
maybe even urgently significant for the health
of humanity - for Urantians to fully understand
the spiritual and cosmic significance of what
this term connotes. By the collective use of this
word throughout the papers, it is eminently
clear to this student that “personality” implies
vast spiritual concepts unfathomed by humans
prior to the publishing of this epochal
revelation in 1955.

```
In this paper I take what I believe to be a
novel position related to the bestowal of
experiential human personality. I advance that
the Father bestows personality specifically
when an individual mortal creature 2:2.6 “...
[has] ascended to the universe level of moral
discernment.” I maintain the point of view that
personality is bestowed directly by our
Universal Father save for instances when the
Father delegates personality bestowal to the
Infinite Spirit cf. (9:8.10). Personality is the
unique bestowal upon humans which the
Universal Father makes upon the living and
associated energies of matter, mind, and spirit,
and which survives with the survival of the
morontial soul. (0:5.11).
This chief of Divine Counselors initiates the
expanded and transformed use of “personality.”
Throughout the Foreword he incrementally
builds context to let the reader know he/she
should get the sense that this concept is such an
expansion of the conventional use of the term
that it is entirely new to humankind.
Bear in mind, the Adjusters already know
before the potential human is born, before he/
she has universe identity (birth), of the full
complement of DNA configurations as well as
intellectual and spiritual capacities.
We can say that life, human life, begins at
conception with the potential to lead to the
actuality of personality bestowal when a child
ascends to the universe level of moral
discernment. This potential is just as dominant
at the initial moment of separation into a single
```
- celled organism (zygote) as it is at any
subsequent moment of emerging actuality.
    I also make the bold and potentially
controversial assertion that the instant
personality is bestowed, which includes the
simultaneous encircuitment by the personality
circuit, the child has completed his/her
ascension to the level of “universe moral
discernment.” Prior to that instant, the human/
creature intellect is functioning initially only as

Personality Bestowal

(Before and After)


animal intellect. It is not until the response of
the sixth adjutant is exhibited and so
recognized by the spirit of wisdom, the co-
ordinator and articulator of all six, do their
minds become immediately encircuited by the
spirit presence of the Holy Spirit of the Local
Universe Mother Spirit.

I separate this paper into two parts. Part I
covers the time frame from birth to personality
bestowal; Part II discusses the time from
conception to just prior to birth, including
aspects of the possibility of the need for either
personalization or repersonalization on the
finaliter probationary worlds.

**Part I** discusses my central position: that
personality is bestowed when a human being
has ascended to the universe level of moral
discernment. I provide rationale that discusses
the various linkages between revelators; I
provide anecdotal evidence from stories that
support this contention; I cross reference
multiple statements and assertions by at least a
dozen authors in _The Urantia Book_ to support
this claim. These references are not just
provided for the reader to have to make his/her
own nexuses. I link all of them with specific
justification that allows the reader to analyze
my rationale.

**Part II** bookends the central theme. The
lead up from conception to birth is a significant
time prior to the morphogenesis of a human. I
describe this growth phase as one in which the
master physical controllers (MPCs) are in
control of this phase of the process. Birth is a
universe event and it is at that milestone that
overcontrol is transitioned from the MPCs to
the adjutant mind-spirits (AMSs). Part II also
argues that only a birthed human may be either
personalized or repersonalized on the finaliter
probationary worlds.

**Part I – The “when” and “why” of
personality bestowal
(From birth to bestowal)**
How can it be that our Heavenly Father
bestows experiential personality at around two
years of age, including his personality circuit,
and yet a child is in existence for about nine
months before experiencing birth? What a
conundrum! The following statement in Paper

```
102 is paramount in understanding our
ascension career as it relates to potentials vs.
actuals:
102:5.1 Although the establishment of the
fact of belief is not equivalent to establishing
the fact of that which is believed,
nevertheless, the evolutionary progression
of simple life to the status of personality
does demonstrate the fact of the existence of
the potential of personality to start with.
And in the time universes, potential is
always supreme over the actual. In the
evolving cosmos the potential is what is to
be, and what is to be is the unfolding of the
purposive mandates of Deity.
As an example, to further drive home this
point, in the final paragraph of this section, the
Melchizedek notes that 102:5.3 “Religion is
[leads] to morality as love is [leads] to duty.”
Ending with...again, “... this is because the
spiritual potentiality of religion is dominant
over the duty actuality of the morality of
evolution.” The takeaway from this section is
that, potentials are supreme/dominant over
actuals in the time universes. We are to be
careful not to mistake dominant for dominate.
With the above
understanding we can
now say that Life, a
human life, begins at
conception and has the
‘potential’ to become a
finaliter. At
conception, we can say
a child has the
potential for
personality bestowal
and to be Adjuster
indwelt. As long as
potential is used,
because of 102:5.
above, we can input any stage of our
(metamorphosing) ascension career all the way
from conception to a paradise finaliter. We can
even say, at conception a child has the capacity
to experience birth and leave out the qualifier
potential at this initial single stage of existence.
However, and this is a biggie, we cannot say at
conception a child has the capacity for
personality bestowal and beyond. We have to
```
```
Hemera
```

```
qualify that with the word ‘potential’ if we go
beyond the first stage. Allow me to explain the
nuances and the two metamorphic stages^1
required as a prerequisite for personality
bestowal to include the personality circuit.
So, the metamorphosing process that takes
place for a human life at conception is
identified as being in an embryonic, transient
and parasitic stage of existence for these nine
months.
112:5.4 Human beings possess identity only
in the material sense. Such qualities of the
self are expressed by the material mind as it
functions in the energy system of the
intellect. When it is said that man has
identity, it is recognized that he is in
possession of a mind circuit which has been
placed in subordination to the acts and
choosing of the will of the human
personality. But this is a material and
purely temporary manifestation, just
as the human embryo is a transient
parasitic stage of human life. Human
beings, from a cosmic perspective, are born,
live, and die in a relative instant of time;
they are not enduring. But mortal
personality, through its own choosing,
possesses the power of transferring its seat
of identity from the passing material-
intellect system to the higher morontia-soul
system which, in association with the
Thought Adjuster, is created as a new
vehicle for personality manifestation.
What about the second stage of
metamorphic development I mentioned as a
prerequisite for personality bestowal to include
the personality circuit?
The second
metamorphic stage of
existence begins at
birth when the “...
material and purely
temporary
manifestation”
exhibits qualities of
self. It is designated a
human being. At
conception the child is
described by the revelators as a ‘human life’
and after birth as a “human being.” The papers
```
```
distinguish the use of human life versus human
being. At and subsequent to birth, several
descriptions are used, i.e. newborn, physical
entity, human being, infant, baby etc. Before
birth terms like human life, child, unborn,
embryonic parasitic stage of existence etc. are
used. Again, human life vs. human being.
Now that these two necessary metamorphic
stages of existence have been identified, it is
time to elaborate what transpires after a human
life at the first stage completes; when the child
experiences birth; and the beginning at the
second stage, when the child, now a human
being, exhibits qualities of self during this
material and purely temporary manifestation.
At the first stage of metamorphic
development, a child at conception has the
potential to ascend to paradise. The child, at
conception, also has the capacity to experience
birth, but not the capacity to be encircuited
with the spirit presence of the Holy Spirit of our
Local Universe Mother Spirit nor personality
bestowal. Potential is required in
expressing an actual at a future
metamorphic stage of development.
At birth, a newborn infant is endowed with
the seven adjutant mind-spirits
42:10.4 2. Adjutant-spirit minds. This is
the ministry of a local universe Mother
Spirit functioning through her seven
adjutant mind-spirits on the teachable
(nonmechanical) level of material mind. On
this level material mind is experiencing: as
subhuman (animal) intellect in the first five
adjutants; as human (moral) intellect in the
seven adjutants; as superhuman (midwayer)
intellect in the last two adjutants.
It will be helpful to break away from this
sequential story to offer the following mind-
level ministries for context. Important to
bear in mind, just as potential is supreme
(dominant) over actual to appreciate the
ascension career, so are the mind-level
ministries critical during these metamorphic
stages. The three mind-level ministries are: at
conception (Living Mind), at birth (Creature
Mind), and when all six adjutants are unified
and functional ( superminded – Holy
Spirit ).
```

Summing the sequence laid out above as
described in 36:5.15:

Living mind, prior to the appearance of
capacity to learn from experience, is the
ministry domain of the Master Physical
Controllers (MPCs). Creature mind **(first five
adjutants);** before acquiring the ability to
recognize divinity and worship Deity, is the
exclusive domain of the adjutant spirits. With
the appearance of the spiritual response **(sixth
adjutant)** of the creature intellect, such
created minds at once become superminded,
being instantly encircuited in the spirit cycles
**(Holy Spirit)** of the local universe Mother
Spirit. (A Vorondadek Son stationed on Urantia
as an observer and acting in this capacity by
request of the Melchizedek Chief of the
Supervising Revelatory Corps.)

Living Mind (First sentence, at conception
and until birth) – First Mind Level

Living mind, prior to the appearance of
capacity to learn from experience, is the
ministry domain of the Master Physical
Controllers (MPCs).

This Living Mind Level at conception is
nonteachable but nonmechanical (being a
‘living mind’). It is ministered by the MPCs
because, as explained in the preceding
paragraph 36:5.14, nonteachable can be
exclusively used (since the option of ‘or’ is
provided) and for the purpose of this level of
Living Mind, the mechanical mind is replaced
with nonmechanical. Since this is a living mind
it is ministered by the MPCs as nonteachable
nonmechanical. The last sentence of 42:10.
also opens the door for this reasoning with
allowing for nonteachable and with 36:5.
(last sentence – use of ‘or vs. and’) allowing for
nonmechanical. This disclosure permits the
MPCs in 36:5.15 to be able to minister to this
first level of mind. Bear in mind that prior to
birth it is referred to as living mind vs. living
material ‘intellect’ mind system. This
metamorphic stage of development is the
‘transit embryonic stage of existence’ as
previously referenced. This level of mind
ministry by the MPCs, at conception, has the
potential for the child to become a finaliter.
This level of mind ministry, at conception, has

```
the capacity to experience birth after about nine
months. The level of mind ministry, at
conception, does not have the capacity, at this
first stage of metamorphic development, to be
encircuited by the spirit presence of the Holy
Spirit of our Local Universe Mother Spirit not
to mention personality bestowal as well as the
personality circuit.
Creature Mind (Second sentence, from birth
to supermind encircuitment) - Second Mind
Level
Creature mind, before acquiring the ability
to recognize divinity and worship Deity, is the
exclusive domain of the adjutant spirits and
42:10.4 meets this requirement. The seven
adjutant mind-spirits are endowed at birth by
our Local Universe Mother Spirit. This material
and purely temporary manifestation exhibit a
quality of self and designates a human being
with (moral) intellect during the
development of this second (temporary)
metamorphic stage of existence.
Superminded (Third sentence, encircuited
in the spirit cycles of the local universe) – Third
Mind Level
With the appearance of the spiritual
response, spirit of worship functioning, the
creature intellect ascends to the universe
level of moral discernment and adjutant of
wisdom signals (108:2.2-3) to Local Universe
Mother Spirit that this prerequisite is met; at
that same moment the encircuitment of the
spirit presence of the Holy Spirit of our
Local Universe Mother Spirit is manifest
including the capacity for the reception of the
Spirit of Truth (194:2.3) – help prepare for
Thought Adjuster. At this same instant,
personality is bestowed, including the
personality circuit.
With the appearance of the spiritual
response of the creature intellect, such created
minds at once become superminded, being
instantly encircuited in the spirit cycles of the
Local Universe Mother Spirit at the Universe
Level of mind-ministry – The Holy Spirit.
Now that the stage has been set with the
three levels of mind ministry, from Living mind
at conception to birth (ministered by the
```

MPCs), let’s discuss the creature mind that was
endowed with the seven adjutant mind-spirits
by our Local Universe Mother Spirit at birth.

As we know, the first five adjutant mind-
spirits on this level of material mind are
experienced as subhuman (animal) intellect; as
human (moral) intellect when all six adjutant
mind-spirits are unified and functional. At
birth, the child has human personality. Initially
only the first five adjutants are experienced as
creature (animal) intellect but always being co-
ordinated and articulated by the adjutant of
wisdom (36:5.12). As the first five adjutants
evolve in function the baby grows and
eventually attains to human (moral) intellect as
described in 42:10.4. Even though the baby is
experiencing initially with the first five
adjutants, the creature intellect is being co-
ordinated and articulated by the spirit of
wisdom. It is endowed with all seven, with the
adjutant of wisdom providing over care and
supervision as the human personality evolves
from creature, material (animal) intellect, to
human personality with (moral) intellect.

The Seventh circle suggests the minimum
and maximum limits of these stages of maturity
realization. Develop is the qualifier here. If the
human being has not developed the minimum
qualities before death, they will be personalized
(not repersonalized) on the probationary
nursery. More on this later.

```
110:6.13 The seventh circle. This level is
entered when human beings develop
the powers of personal choice, individual
decision, moral responsibility, and the
capacity for the attainment of spiritual
individuality. This signifies the united
function of the seven adjutant mind-spirits
under the direction of the spirit of wisdom,
the encircuitment of the mortal
creature in the influence of the Holy
Spirit , and, on Urantia, the first
functioning of the Spirit of Truth, together
with the reception of a Thought Adjuster in
the mortal mind. Entrance upon the
seventh circle constitutes a mortal creature
a truly potential citizen of the local
universe.
Again, these are suggested minimums and
```
```
maximums. The
minimum begins when
the seventh adjutant
mind-spirit articulates
(108:2.2-3) the child
has ascended to the
Universe Level of
moral discernment,
indicating the creature
mind has exhibited the
worship outreach, at
once (36:5.15), is
instantly encircuited
with the spirit
presence of the Holy
Spirit. The maximums
of the seventh circle will be advanced later.
Now for the climax... Personality Circuit and
Personality Bestowal
In 2:2.6 below, the Divine Counselor is
describing when and how the ‘personality
circuit’ is encircuited.
The personality circuit is established when
“a mortal creature ascends to the universe
level of moral discernment.” This also includes
the bestowal of personality (5:6.6). This is at
the same moment the adjutant of wisdom
confirms the sixth adjutant mind-spirit is
functioning and the child is now experiencing
with the (moral) intellect. This is a ‘trinity
event’ in the sense that when a child ascends to
the universe level of moral discernment in
recognition of the spirit response of the spirit of
worship, being confirmed by the adjutant of
wisdom, and acknowledged by the Local
Universe Mother Spirit, she instantly encircuits
her spirit presence of the Holy Spirit of the
Universe Mother Spirit. This is the Supermind
(36:5.15) functioning at the Universe Level. It is
a Nebadon variant of the cosmic mind of the
Superuniverse of Orvonton. Ascending to the
Universe Level of moral discernment is the
prerequisite and what our Paradise Father set
as the criteria for his personality bestowal and
his personality circuit. A Divine Counselor of
Uversa confirms this and adds additional
support in describing this instantiation
moment. (5:6.6)
2:2.6 God is eternally and infinitely

perfect, he cannot personally know
imperfection as his own experience, but he
does share the consciousness of all the
experience of imperfectness of all the
struggling creatures of the evolutionary
universes of all the Paradise Creator Sons.
**The personal and liberating touch of
the God of perfection** overshadows the
hearts and **encircuits** the natures of all
those mortal creatures who have **ascended
to the universe level of moral
discernment**. In this manner, as well as
through the contacts of the divine presence,
the Universal Father actually participates in
the experience with immaturity and
imperfection in the evolving career of every
moral being of the entire universe.
5:6.6 Capacity for divine personality is
inherent in the prepersonal Adjuster;
capacity for human personality is potential
in the cosmic-mind endowment of the
human being. But the experiential
personality of mortal man is not observable
as an active and functional reality **until
after the material life vehicle** of the
mortal creature has been **touched by the
liberating divinity of the Universal
Father** , being thus launched upon the seas
of experience as a self-conscious and a
(relatively) self-determinative and self-
creative personality. The material self is
truly and unqualifiedly personal.
5:6.6 – Personality Bestowal
When Bestowed: Touched by the liberating
divinity of the Universal Father

Result: Now observable as an active and
functional reality. Considered as self-conscious
and truly unqualifiedly personal.

2:2.6 – Personality Circuit
When Encircuited: When the personal and
liberating touch of the God of perfection
encircuits the natures of those mortal creatures
who have ascended to the universe level of
moral discernment.

Now, this sheds light and gives more
meaning as to when personality is bestowed
and describes that at that time mortal man is
observable as an active and functional reality.

```
Prior to that, the material life vehicle of the
newborn child, was still evolving and
developing the first five adjutants, a human
being with (creature) intellect, all the time
being co-ordinated and articulated by the spirit
of wisdom. It was not recognized as being
observable as an active and functional reality, a
human being with (moral) intellect.
When a child responds to the spirit of
worship, it has ascended to the universe level of
moral discernment (moral intellect). Having
been co-ordinated and articulated all along to
the Local Universe Mother Spirit by the
adjutant of wisdom, at that moment, my so-
called mortal “trinity event” took place. 1)
Encircuitment of the spirit presence of the Holy
Spirit of our Local Universe Mother Spirit
(supermind manifestation - Instantly
encircuited in the Spirit Cycles at the Universe
Level), 2) Capacity for the Spirit of Truth and 3)
The instantiation of the bestowal of personality
and the encircuitment of the personality circuit.
By the time a child ascends to the universe
level of moral discernment and is recognized as
self-conscious and truly unqualifiedly personal
it is around two years of age, a toddler. The
indwelling thought adjuster arrives just under
six (~ 1934) years (108:2.1). I call it the 5- 10 - 4
effect. That is five years, ten months and four
days. Pinning down to the average date of
arrival is not given for the bestowal of
personality and the personality circuit.
However, a meaningful and acceptable time
frame can be arrived at from 2:2.6 and 5:6.6.
There have been long time students, when
reading 2:2.6, regarding ‘moral discernment,’
assumed that meant ‘moral choice,’ ‘moral
decision’ and the author was talking about the
Thought Adjuster. Upon closer look and
reflection, that is clearly not the case. This is
established in the sentence that followed ‘moral
discernment’ that it is not referring to the
Divine Presence.
To arrive at the age of around two years old
for the bestowal of personality and personality
circuit, the following link makes this
observation: How do children develop a sense
of self? https://theconversation.com/how-do-
children-develop-a-sense-of-self- 56118
```

But it is not until children approach their
second birthday that they start to develop a
sense of self and are able to reflect on
themselves from the perspective of somebody
else.

As one drills down further, additional links
shows how richly this is referenced with 13
published artifacts including contemporary
books. This idea, and my position, is on solid
ground. [http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/](http://www.child-encyclopedia.com/)
emotions/according-experts/self-conscious-
emotions

It is more than reasonable to conclude that
toddlers can exhibit this Universe level of moral
discernment. I can point to a number of
anecdotal stories that exhibit this capability,
but none are so uplifting to the human spirit
than a good friend, a long time Urantia Book
student, articulated to me as we were
discussing my ideas about this paper. Before I
retell this story, I believe it is instructive to re-
state what I posited in the introduction: an
understanding of “personality” used
throughout the papers is vitally important –
maybe even urgently significant for the health
of humanity - for Urantians to fully understand
the spiritual and cosmic significance of what
their use of “personality” connotes. I believe
students of the Urantia Papers who process and
detect in their lives these esoteric cosmic
concepts will not only recognize events that
support what the revelators have provided the
Urantian humanity, but actively look for these
occasions.

My friend (I will call him Bob) is the
maternal-sided grandfather to a toddler (I will
call him Mason) who was not yet three years
old (around 2 1/2) at the time. They were at a
family event where Bob found himself sitting
directly opposite Mason and one of Mason’s
contemporaries – a child of about two – at a
rectangular wooden kitchen table. I will refer to
this other child as Maddox. The area was a
combination living and kitchen space with
about twenty adults and an equal number of
children of all ages but mostly between one to
four years old. It was quite a boisterous and
happy occasion Mason’s parents had organized
in honor of the “new house” as Mason calls it.

```
As a plate of food was simultaneously being
placed in front of the two boys, Bob noticed
Mason began to reach into Maddox’s plate with
what Bob reactively thought in his mind was to
grab some food. Who knows what a child of two
might impetuously decide to do, thought Bob.
My good friend immediately called Mason’s
name out quite loudly in order to get Mason to
stop his hand from plunging unceremoniously
into Maddox’s plate – after all, he had one of
his own, didn’t he? According to Bob, both
Mason’s mother and grandmother heard this
calling of Mason’s name, saw what was about to
transpire, and began to rebuke Mason for doing
so.
Bob recalls that almost instantaneously
(and it seems time was moving in slow motion
in Bob’s memory of it) Mason looked up to
Papa and said: “... he had a hair in his food; I
just wanted to take it out.” My friend
immediately attempted to rectify the reactions
of Mom and Grandma (but the noise in the
room drowned out his attempts). So, Papa
lowered his head and voice to Mason and
provided a grandfatherly statement of support
that Mason’s actions were OK but Maddox
probably didn’t want other hands in his food.
“It’s best you let Maddox take the hair out.” Bob
then loudly proclaimed to the crowd that “...
we’re doing OK; Mason was just getting a hair
out of Maddox’s food; Maddox is going to get it
out himself. Mason was just trying to help
Maddox.”
What comes to mind after hearing this story
reinforces what the Divine Counselor says
about morality: that it has its origin in the
reason of self-consciousness. And that “social
surroundings necessitate ethical adjustments;
[while] moral situations require the making of
choices in the highest realms of reason.” You
may have your own anecdotal stories similar to
this one. It is reasonable to conclude that at
least on the surface of this event, Mason clearly
exhibited arrival at the universe level of moral
discernment as defined in this paper, if not
before.
When 2:2.6 and 5:6.6 talk about a self-
creative personality that is truly and
unqualifiedly personal and having ascended to
the universe level of moral discernment, when
```

the Holy Spirit first manifests, this constitutes
the encircuitment of the personality circuit
concurrently with the bestowal of personality. A
child can now experience as a self-conscious
and a (relatively) self-determinative and self-
creative personality. The material self is truly
and unqualifiedly personal.

Again, at birth, just as at conception, we
have the potential to become finaliters. At birth
we have the potential, just as at conception, to
be indwelt by our Thought Adjuster who
‘forecasted’ and volunteered at conception to
indwell the chosen child. At birth, we do not
have the capacity to be indwelt by a Thought
Adjuster, only the potential. At birth, we do
have the capacity for personality bestowal
because, at birth, we are endowed with the
seven adjutant mind-spirits which enables us to
ascend to the universe level of moral
discernment. This manifests when the spirit of
worship makes its first contact with the mind of
the child. At this same moment the spirit of
wisdom articulates this event to the Local
Universe Mother Spirit, and at that instant –
the Mother Spirit encircuits the child with the
spirit presence of the **Holy Spirit** of our local
universe Mother Spirit (The **first function of
Universe Level of mind ministry** ). This
also includes the capacity for reception of The
Spirit of Truth which, all combined, is the
prerequisite for the instantiation of the
personality circuit and simultaneous bestowal
of personality. At this stage of metamorphic
development, we **now** have the capacity for the
Thought Adjuster to indwell the child. As yet,
we do not have the capacity to become a
finaliter. During this continued temporary
material manifestation of metamorphic
development, once a moral decision is made
(vs. moral discernment), just under six years
old, then we can say the ‘sky’ is the limit...or
should we say Paradise is our destination
depending on the individual choice of this faith
son- daughter of God. When we are indwelt by
our Divine Fragment, we no longer have to say
we have only the potential to become a finaliter,
we can now say, unqualifiedly, we have the
capacity and it is dependent on our personal
choice.

```
Moral discernment is the linchpin the
```
```
revelators point to when discussing personality
```
- specifically the _universe_ level of moral
discernment. There is but one reference to this
compound term in the entire set of papers - by
a Divine Counselor acting by authority of the
Ancients of Days on Uversa. It appears in paper
two, specifically at 2:2.6:
    God is eternally and infinitely perfect; he
cannot personally know imperfection as his
own experience, but he does share the
consciousness of all the experience of
imperfectness of all the struggling creatures of
the evolutionary universes of all the Paradise
Creator Sons. **The personal and liberating
touch of the God of perfection**
overshadows the hearts and **encircuits** the
natures of all those mortal creatures who have
**ascended to the universe level of moral
discernment.** In this manner, as well as
through the contacts of the divine presence, the
Universal Father actually participates in the
experience with immaturity and imperfection
in the evolving career of every moral being of
the entire universe.
    Discernment is the capability of being able
to see, recognize, understand, or decide
something. An ability to discern means one is
aware of something and knows what it is; one
can perceive an object or situation but
discerning means with less than one-hundred
percent clarity. **Moral discernment
presages morality; one can’t make a
moral decision without first having a
foundation of moral discernment.** Moral
discernment implies the acquisition of the
norms and standards of one’s society or
religion. Thus, a moral decision is different in
kind from attaining moral discernment
capabilities. Morality implies a decision(s).
Morality cannot simply be reduced to the
acquisition of the norms and standards of one’s
society or religion. These differences inform us
that children’s morality involves exercising
judgment, rather than directly resulting from
the inculcation of norms by societal influences,
presumably by parents.
    Nevertheless, there should be no
speculation regarding what the Divine
Counselor means by “liberating touch.” For the
next sentence clearly differentiates the


personality circuit from the thought adjuster.
“In this manner” refers to the preceding
sentence regarding the Father’s liberation of
the mortal creature as the first of two Father-
components - the second refers to the divine
adjuster (an objective presence in the mind of
the mortal) – describing how the Father
“actually participates in the experience of every
moral being of the entire universe.” The entire
universe clearly refers to the seven
superuniveses, Havona, and Paradise (The
Grand Universe).

As noted in the introduction, personality is
independent of, and antecedent to, the
bestowal of the Thought Adjuster. The
revelators tell us emphatically that on Urantia
108:2.1 “Adjusters reach their human subjects, on

the average, just prior to the sixth birthday. In
the present generation [first half of the 20th
century] it is running five years, ten months,
and four days; that is, on the 2,134th day of
terrestrial life.” What this implies is that a
child, perhaps one that is a normally endowed
toddler of two years old, having ascended to the
universe level of moral discernment, met the
**prerequisite of the endowment of the
Holy Spirit** , Spirit of Truth and Personality
Bestowal to have the capacity for the indwelling
of the divine fragment.

Always remember, in relation to the
indwelling of the Thought Adjuster, if the Spirit
of Truth is present on the planet and spirit of
worship is exhibited, the spirit of wisdom
‘begins to **function** ’ in its own right, and when
a moral decision is made the adjuster instantly
invades the mortal intellect. (108:2.3, 62:6.5).
With regard to the phrase ‘begins to function’,
as it relates to the spirit of wisdom above, it
would prove helpful to keep this in context with
36:5.12. The spirit of wisdom is also the co-
ordinator and articulator of all the others. All
the adjutant mind-spirits evolve in function. I
look forward to current and future Urantia
students and scholars to expand on this insight.

**Part II – The before-and-after
personality bestowal**
At the beginning of Part 1, I presented a
conundrum on how personality can be
bestowed at around two years of age and yet fits

```
in with a child being in existence for about nine
months before experiencing birth. I’ve devoted
eleven pages to explain my conjectures with
references to back up my position and the
rationale behind it. Now the second, and I
hope, final conundrum.
As I have stated in the introduction, only a
birthed human may be either personalized or
repersonalized on the finaliter probationary
worlds. I make this conjecture, in part, because
I associate the fact of the Archangel personality
record keepers who 37:3.7 “[keep straight] each
mortal of time from the moment of birth” with
the 47:2.1 “acquirement of individual status on
the universe records.”
37:3.7 The Worlds of the Archangels. The
seventh group of the encircling Salvington
worlds, with their associated satellites, is
assigned to the archangels. Sphere number
one and all of its six tributary satellites are
occupied by the personality record keepers.
This enormous corps of recorders busy
themselves with keeping straight the record
of each mortal of time from the moment of
birth up through the universe career until
such an individual either leaves Salvington
for the superuniverse regime or is "blotted
out of recorded existence" by the mandate
of the Ancients of Days.
But, what happens when infants die during
the time after birth but before personality is
bestowed - before my so-called ‘trinity event’ -
before ascending to the universe level of moral
discernment and encircuited in the spirit
presence of the Holy Spirit and simultaneously
with the instantiation of the personality and
personality circuit? The Probationary Nursey –
Infant-receiving schools - is the safety net to
ensure the potential survival of these young
ones.
After birth and before personality
bestowal
From birth until personality is bestowed,
the baby is always ‘Personalized’ (vs.
Repersonalized) with the noted requirements
that a Brilliant Evening Star describes.
47:2.1 The infant-receiving schools of
Satania are situated on the finaliter world,
```

the first of the Jerusem transition-culture
spheres. These infant-receiving schools are
enterprises devoted to the nurture and
training of the children of time, including
those who have died on the evolutionary
worlds of space before the acquirement of
individual status on the universe records. In
the event of the survival of either or both of
such a child's parents, the guardian of
destiny deputizes her associated cherubim
as the custodian of the child's potential
identity, charging the cherubim with the
responsibility of delivering this undeveloped
soul into the hands of the Mansion World
Teachers in the probationary nurseries of
the morontia worlds.
47:2.2 It is these same deserted cherubim
who, as Mansion World Teachers, under the
supervision of the Melchizedeks, maintain
such extensive educational facilities for the
training of the probationary wards of the
finaliters. These **wards** of the finaliters,
these infants of ascending mortals, are
**always personalized** as of their exact
physical status at the time of death except
for reproductive potential. This awakening
occurs at the exact time of the parental
arrival on the first mansion world. And then
are these children given every opportunity,
as they are, to choose the heavenly way just
as they would have made such a choice on
the worlds where death so untimely
terminated their careers.
**After personality bestowal and before
Thought Adjuster arrival**
What about the toddlers who die after
personality is bestowed but before being
indwelt by the Thought Adjuster? From
Personality bestowal and before Adjuster
arriving, the child is **Repersonalized** in the
probationary nursery. (47:2.3-4)

```
47:2.3 On the nursery world, probationary
creatures are grouped according to whether
or not they have Adjusters, for the Adjusters
come to indwell these material children just
as on the worlds of time. Children of pre-
Adjuster ages are cared for in families of
five, ranging in ages from one year and
under up to approximately five years, or
```
```
that age when the Adjuster arrives.
After Adjuster Arrival and not chose the
Paradise career
And what about Adjuster-indwelt children
and youths who die and have not made the
choice concerning the Paradise career? To
answer that situation, I point to what the
Brilliant Evening Star says about this:
47:2.5 The Adjuster-indwelt children and
youths on the finaliter world are also reared
in families of five, ranging in ages from six
to fourteen; approximately, these families
consist of children whose ages are six, eight,
ten, twelve, and fourteen. Any time after
sixteen, if final choice has been made, they
translate to the first mansion world and
begin their Paradise ascent. Some make a
choice before this age and go on to the
ascension spheres, but very few children
under sixteen years of age, as reckoned by
Urantia standards, will be found on the
mansion worlds.
All children on the evolving worlds who
have Thought Adjusters, but who before death
had not made a choice concerning the Paradise
career, are also repersonalized (‘also’ is
referring to 47:2.3-4 after personality bestowal
but before adjuster arrival) on the finaliter
world of the system, where they likewise grow
up in the families of the Material Sons and
their associates as do those little ones who
arrived without Adjusters, but who will
subsequently receive the Mystery Monitors
after attaining the requisite age of moral choice.
(47:2.4)
As you can see, children who are bestowed
with Personality but not made a moral decision
(PreAdjuster age) and those Adjuster-indwelt
children as well as youths are
Repersonalized in the infant receiving
schools. The precious little ones at birth who
die before personality bestowal are
Personalized (wards of the finaliters) per
47:2.1-2 above.
Other Points of View
There are other viewpoints out there from
sincere students of The Urantia Book. Some
believe that personality is bestowed at
```

conception, others somewhere during the
trimester of pregnancy. Still others firmly
believe personality is bestowed at birth. I
respect all of them. However, after reading this
position paper, if anyone holds a point of view
different from the one outlined in this paper,
they are challenged to explain what 2:2.6 and
5:6.6 means to them as well as the support
references.

**Conclusion/Epilogue**
Let us not treat lightly that a child’s life
begins at conception. Bear in mind, after all,
the ideal mortal marriage is humanly sacred.
(83:8.5) Our marriages on six O six being
humanly sacred, pause to consider how much
more divinely sacred and precious is a child’s
life at conception that has been ordained by our
Paradise Parent for the **potential** to be indwelt
by his divine fragment and ascend to paradise
with a wonderful career path of experience
along the way. All of this in advance...after all,
in the time universes potentials are always
supreme over actuals.

This paper is entirely my point of view.
However, it has gone thru a peer-review
process of a small group of long time students
of Ole’ Blue. Their experiences vary; parents
with children and grandparents, single parents,
and interested long-time students of the
papers. The combined total of experiencing and
studying this revelation participating in the
peer-review process is over 300 years.

When all is said and done, the ascension
career from conception to the mortal corps of
finality is based on Love, focused on Love,
driven by Love and motivated by Love by the
LOVE of our Heavenly Paradise Father. Yes, it’s
true, our Heavenly Father loves us SO much he
can’t help himself!

~ NOTES ~
(1) For purposes of this paper I use the term
“metamorphic” to describe human growth
beginning at conception. I further delineate two
distinct cosmically significant stages that the
revelation distinguishes: 1) from conception to
just prior to birth and 2) from birth onward.
There is a back story that led up to this
position paper that you may find intriguing and
useful. It has to do with Evangelism and The
Urantia Book and Universe-Conscious citizens.

clay by the artists of that era. The Jōmon period
is generally identified with hunting and
gathering ways of life, especially the intense
utilization of marine resources in shellfish
collecting and deep-sea fishing.

Jōmon means "rope-patterned" referring to
the pottery.

The Jōmon period is divided into six sub-
periods. Some scholars disagree about the exact
dates for each period. The sub-periods are:

- Incipient Jōmon 13000-8000 B.C.E. or
11000 - 7500 B.C.E.
- Earliest (Initial) Jōmon 8000-5000 B.C.E.
or 7500 – 4000 B.C.E.
- Early Jōmon 5000-2500 B.C.E. or 4000 –
3000 B.C.E.
- Middle Jōmon 2500-1500 B.C.E. or 3000
- 2000 B.C.E.
- Late Jōmon 1500-1000 B.C.E. or 2000 –
1000 B.C.E.
- Final (Latest) Jōmon 1000-300 B.C.E. or
1000 – 500 B.C.E
79:7.1 About fifteen thousand years ago the
Andites, in considerable numbers, were
traversing the pass of Ti Tao and spreading
out over the upper valley of the Yellow River
among the Chinese settlements of Kansu.
Presently they penetrated eastward to
Honan, where the most progressive
settlements were situated. This infiltration
from the west was about half Andonite and
half Andite.
The Jōmon Culture has been determined to
be the ancestors of the modern Japanese
people. They moved off the mainland of Asia as
the Northern Chinese migrated south, bringing
with them new forms of manufacture, art, and
agriculture. The Jōmon Culture was not Andite.
They portrayed characteristics more of a Red,
Yellow, or Andonic culture, as seen in their
animal worship, shelter development and
genetic makeup. However, there is apparent
Andite influence in the “Middle” to “Late”
Jōmon periods, as reflected in the
advancements in agriculture, shelter building
and pottery. Numerous archaeological sites
with artifacts of this Neolithic culture have
been discovered, from the northern island of
Hokkaido to the southern Ryukyus. The
Hokkaido region is highly interesting due to the
many ancient sites located there, as well as
being the home of the modern-day descendants
of the Jōmon people. They are called “Ainu.”


```
ANDITE INFLUENCE?
```
78:5.6 These Andites were the so-called
Dravidian and later Aryan conquerors of
India; and their presence in central Asia
greatly upstepped the ancestors of the
Turanians. Many of this race journeyed to
China by way of both Sinkiang and Tibet
and added desirable qualities to the later
Chinese stocks. From time to time small
groups made their way into Japan,
Formosa, the East Indies, and southern
China, though very few entered southern
China by the coastal route.
_The Urantia Book_ speaks of the subsequent
improvements in many cultures from the
Middle East to Europe, Asia, and into South
America as a result of the Andite migrations
pouring out of Mesopotamia and adjacent
regions. One can’t help but wonder when and
where the Andites left their mark in Japan?

The Middle to Late Jōmon period marks an
interesting evolution of Jōmon art, agriculture,
and religious practices. Perhaps the most
intriguing advancements and possible result of
Andite influence was found in the art and
shelter design. During this period, the artists
started creating the Dogu statues. These statues
are a major evolution in figurine design in the
Jōmon culture.

Most historical professionals seem to agree
that the Dogu statues represent fertility
worship within their culture. Fertility worship
usually coincides with sun worship, and in
some cases represents the evolution of culture

```
from stone age to bronze age. The existence of
sun worship can easily be seen among the many
stone circle formations scattered about Japan.
80:9.13 These were the times of the New
Stone Age overlapping the oncoming Bronze
Age. In Scandinavia it was the Bronze Age
associated with mother worship. In
southern France and Spain it was the New
Stone Age associated with sun worship. This
was the time of the building of the circular
and roofless sun temples. (3000 B.C.)
KAZUNO, JAPAN
Ōyu Stone Circles (2000 B.C.-1500 B.C.)
The Urantia Book tells us that the majority
of Adamic and Andite migrations from
Mesopotamia went into northern Europe, and
by 3000 B.C. they were diluted in culture to the
point of fertility and sun worship. This is a
retrogression from Edenic culture but still gives
us insight into where Garden culture made its
influences. Who else would bring these
advancements to a new land than the Andites?
```

In Northern Japan we see similar
stone circles and bronze figurines
of Godlike creatures around 2000

- 1500 B.C. An interesting note is
that certain pre-Incan statues in
South America seem to slightly
resemble some Dogu statues.
Might these be the fleeting
impressions left behind by the 132
Andite sailors that departed from
the coast of Japan, island hopping
along the way to Peru, and
became the predecessors the
Inca?

78:5.7 One hundred and
thirty-two of this race,
embarking in a fleet of small
boats from Japan, eventually
reached South America and by
intermarriage with the natives
of the Andes established the
ancestry of the later rulers of
the Incas. They crossed the
Pacific by easy stages, tarrying
on the many islands they
found along the way. The
islands of the Polynesian
group were both more
numerous and larger then
than now, and these Andite
sailors, together with some
who followed them,
biologically modified the
native groups in transit. Many
flourishing centers of
civilization grew up on these
now submerged lands as a
result of Andite penetration.
Easter Island was long a
religious and administrative
center of one of these lost
groups. But of the Andites who
navigated the Pacific of long
ago none but the one hundred
and thirty-two ever reached
the mainland of the Americas.
Until modern academia
catches up to revelation, we might
have to wait a long time until
academic professionals can piece
together the Andite migration


across the Pacific Ocean and into south
America. For now, we can only speculate as to
what specific influences were left behind by the
advanced culture of the Andites. Advancements
in agriculture, pottery, art, and religion usually
represent some Andite influence. Similar
symbols shared by many cultures throughout
the world in ancient times seem to reflect
Garden culture knowledge. The spiral has been
seen from Europe to Japan and into Peru,
perhaps representing the irrigation channels of
the Garden of Eden.

As for the Jōmon Culture, I feel modern
academia has correctly proven the statement
the Urantia Book makes when it says:

79:6.3 The ancestors of the Japanese
people were not driven off the mainland
until 12,000 B.C., when they were dislodged
by a powerful southern-coastwise thrust of
the northern Chinese tribes.
We can see who these people were, and
more importantly we can see how the Jōmon
people were the recipients of gradual cultural
improvement from what influence they did
receive from Andite culture as they migrated
and homogenized with the surrounding tribes.
Japan has a fascinating history and knowing
the intricacies of the ancient foundations that

```
culminated in modern day Japan has only
revealed even greater depth and wisdom
embedded in the Japanese culture. From
12,000 B.C. to A.D. 2017 real culture in Japan
was brought by the Jōmon people and
advanced by the Andite influences through
China and into Japan. There are still many
mysteries left unsolved regarding the migration
of the Andites through Japan, but their mark
was left and now Japan and the rest of the
world are better because of it.

Christianity in the first
few centuries of the
Christian era was
characterized by many
divergent beliefs about
who or what Jesus
actually was. Diverse
communities of believers
with dynamic and sometimes visionary
leadership were evolving throughout the
Mediterranean world and beyond. Significant
conflicts between these groups shaped what
became orthodoxy. Some of the primary beliefs
are listed below. Which one(s) most closely
reflect the Christology of _The Urantia Book_?

**Early Beliefs About the Nature of Christ
Adoptionists:** A human Jesus was
adopted by God at the time of his baptism and
made his son. His human and divine natures
existed separately.

**Apollinarians:** Christ had a single divine
nature. He did not have a human mind but
rather had a human body and emotions with a
divine mind.

```
Arians: God the Son and God the Father
are not fully equal. If the Son was "begotten" it
means that he post-dates the Father and is
therefore neither equal nor coeternal with the
Father.
Basilides: Christ came to liberate the
forces of light from the material realm of
ignorance and evil. Christ was the mind of God
which descended upon Jesus at his baptism.
Chalcedonian: Two natures, human and
divine, are united in the one person (or
personality) of Jesus. (This is the position that
became the orthodoxy of the mainstream
church after the Council of Chalcedon in 451.)
Docetists: Christ had no real human
nature. His image was only an illusory shape, a
manifestation of a purely divine being. His
sufferings on the cross were illusory.
Diothelites: Jesus had two natures and
two wills.
Ebionites: Early Jewish-Christian
movement following Jesus as a human being.
He had no divine nature.
Eutyches: Jesus' human nature was deified
```
Exploring Urantia Book Christology


and subsumed into the single divine essence of
Christ. He was a fusion of human and divine
natures but no longer had a specifically human
identity.

**Gnostics:** Christ was a divine being come
to redeem believers from the evil and
contaminated material world. Christ's true
identity or nature was always divine and, while
on earth, he occupied a supernatural body quite
distinct from humanity.

**Manicheans:** The cosmos consists of an
absolute and eternal war between forces of light
and darkness. Christ was a liberator come to
redeem the elements of light trapped in the
material world. He was thus a purely
supernatural or divine being and any human or
material elements must be illusory.
(Originating in the third century, this
movement became an independent world
religion.)

**Marcion:** Jesus Christ was the son of the
good God of the New Testament who sent him
to earth to save the world from the old spiritual
regime of the flawed God of the Old Testament.

**Miaphysites:** The person of Jesus had a
divine nature and a human nature, united into
a compound being "without separation, without
mixture, without confusion, and without
alteration."

**Monophysites:** Christ was divine, one
nature; not human. He was God incarnate.

**Monotheletes:** Christ had two natures but
a single will.

**Nestorians:** Christ had two natures,
human and divine, but not in a true union.
Mary could thus be called the Mother of Christ,
but not the Mother of God.

**Paul of Samosata:** A man, Jesus, became
divine at the time of his baptism.

**Sabellius:** Christ had a human body but no
real human nature. He was identical to God in
his nature. Christ was one with the Father to
the extent that it was the Father who suffered
on the cross.

**Valentinus:** The divine Christ came to
redeem the evil world but had no true human

```
nature; his body was always supernatural
rather than truly human.
Word/Flesh Christology: The Logos
became flesh so the Logos was the principle
guiding Christ's flesh or body. Christ lived as a
representative of humanity as a whole rather
than a fully developed human individual in his
own right.
Word/Man Christology: The Logos
became human in the form of the man Jesus
Christ. Christ was not just a generic
representative of humanity, but a fully
individual human being.

_by Errol Strider_

There was a man once, truly that
Who is known for the cross that he bore
But who laughed in the market
And slept on the floor
Who designed riverboats in Capernaum
Studied the ways of all men
In order to rule in perfection
With its trials, upsets, and demands
A universe of 10 million planets
Which the man, who upholds it
Designed, fashioned and planned.

There was a man once, truly that.
Who embraced the mortal dilemma
With a boundless trust
And abiding faith.
Who was immersed in a River Jordan
Allowing himself to give in
To life as we know it in fullness
With its sores, its aches and injustice
But which serves a great hidden purpose
Which the man, who entered its bowels
Could foresee what to us is so dim.

There was a man once, truly that
Who transcended all tradition and dogma
Who forgave the sin
And loved the sinner
Who feared not one who attacked him
But attempted to show them the truth.
By example, he sat in their presence,
With his words, his acts, and entreaties
He sought to convince those around him
That all men could live as he
Secure, abandoned and free.

There was a man once, truly that
A man who broke from his elders
Made friends with the poor
Played with the kids
Made choices like all other men
To use power for good or for evil
To be simple or prideful and vain
Grappled with grief, failure, betrayal,
But still to remain steadfast to the God,
Who this man knew always as Father and friend.
There was a man once, truly that.

```
Who did not what others expected
Disappointing his pupils
Estranging his mother
Rejecting requests of the masses
When they wanted to make him king
Yet allowed them to place down the palms
As he rode on an ass to the city
Where they rejected once and for all
This true man, who understood them
And forgave their blindness and gall.
```
```
There was a man once, truly that.
A man whom we all misinterpret
Who knows all as his brother
To the exclusion of none
Who did not really die on the cross
To wash away our sins
But to reveal a God of mercy
Who forgives, only loves, has compassion
On his ignorant children who err
So this man died only to show them
How far love would go for them.
```
```
There was a man once, truly that.
Whose life on this beleaguered planet
Was a model for all to behold.
Who revealed our humanity to us
What each person can actually become
When we join with this man in knowing
The Spirit that indwells our hearts.
And as he rose from the darkness of death
And appeared to those who knew him
He showed us the path to aliveness...
The deep forever mystery
Of the timeless journey of love.

Our Universe Mother Spirit is gathering the
women. She is gathering them at the
Parliament of World Religions, where she
brought together thousands of people from
every faith tradition at the first Women’s
Assembly at the Parliament in Salt Lake City in

2016. She is gathering them at the United
Nations, where hundreds of women from
around the world gather every spring in New
York City at the UN Commission on the Status
of Women to advocate for a 5th UN Women’s
World Conference. Mother is even calling on
women to take to the streets. On January 21st,
2017, an estimated 2.6 million women took part
in 673 marches around the world with the
largest taking place in Washington. Crowds of
marching women were so large in some cities
that marching was almost impossible. In

```
Chicago, organizers halted the march and
rallied at Grant Park instead as crowds swelled
to 150,000. In New York City, the number was
400,000; in Boston, media reported more than
100,000 people marching on Boston Common.
There were 60,000 in Oakland, Calif., 750,000
in Los Angeles, and another 100,000 in San
Francisco. Women responded from around the
globe with 10,000 marching in Australia, more
than 100,000 in London, 7,000 in Paris and
more in Rome. From Ghana to Greece, from
Reykjavik to Costa Rica, from Tanzania to
Thailand, women answered Mother’s call.
The Women’s March was followed quickly
by the #MeToo movement in which many
women around the country felt led to finally
stand up and confront the long history of sexual
harassment and sexual abuse of women. The
phrase has become the rallying cry of the anti-
sexual harassment movement, has raised
```
Working with Mother Spirit

to Uplift the World

Gathering the Women

```
Meredith Tenney Sharon Porter^ Mary Huggins Elisabeth Callahan
```

awareness of the problem, and has challenged
some of the most powerful men in sports,
entertainment, and politics.

Women have answered Mother Spirit’s call
to step up into leadership so enthusiastically
that a historic wave of women is running for
public office. A record number of women
entered the U.S. House and Senate races in the
fall of 2018 - with 54 women running for Senate
seats and 394 women running for the House
while 56 women vied for office in governor’s
races. In 1970, there was just one female Senate
candidate. Starting in January 2019 the 116th
Congress will have 24 women Senators and 102
women serving in the House of
Representatives. The _Center for Responsive
Politics_ reports a 67% increase in women
running for congressional and gubernatorial
seats since 2016!

The recent Senate hearing and controversy
over the confirmation of Supreme Court Justice
Kavanaugh is only a microcosm of the struggle
for gender equality and women’s rights that is
occurring around the globe. The days in which
women could be taken advantage of with
impunity are rapidly vanishing, and a new
prototype of male/female relationship that
reflects divine patterns of living is needed.

**THE IMPACT ON MEN**
The ascent of feminine principles, which
seek to establish balance between the
masculine and feminine forces of our natures,
inevitably triggers a proportionate, negative
reaction among some men and even some
women by challenging deeply held beliefs. It is,
perhaps, understandable why some men are
reacting with fear and anger toward women at
the present time as they witness the rapid social
changes resulting from the empowerment of
women.

As our world psyche reconnects more fully
to the repressed feminine, some men fear they
will lose their male identity and be dispossessed
of their former [powerful] place in society. And
they are right in certain respects because as the
collective whole of humanity reunites with the
repressed feminine, enormous adjustments will
be required and it will take time to achieve a
new balance in our planetary consciousness.

```
For a very long time in our Western and world
civilizations, the feminine expression of God’s
nature in our Western and world civilization -
that which is the very source of life and mind in
the universe – has been controlled, exploited
and objectified by the dominant masculine
power structure. This is sometimes referred to
as the unacknowledged shadow side of the
masculine. It is clearly being exposed,
recognized, and named during the current
epoch. Gradually it will be more fully exposed
and tamed. This may be a scary process for
some – not all – men. Therefore, we have a
responsibility to educate about this process of
psychosocial evolution, to bring light and
understanding to the changes, and to disarm
fear through compassionate listening and
dialogue.
Men and women must go through this
process of change together with as much
clarity, openness, trust, and courage as
possible, that is to say, with the understanding
that our gender differences will 84:6.6 “continue
to intrigue, stimulate, encourage, and assist
each other” even as a greater relationship of
mutuality between the genders is being reached
as part of the evolutionary plan of progressive
perfection.
It could be said that the changes in the
social fabric of Western society (and our whole
world) that have been underway since the early
20th century are perhaps directly attributable
to the remarkable transition in the relationship
between our Creator Son Michael and our
Creative Mother Spirit that occurred when
Michael attained to his status as a Master Son,
after completing his seventh and final bestowal
mission as Jesus. At that time Michael issued
the “Proclamation of Equality” which affirmed
the Mother Spirit’s equality with him in all
endowments of personality and attributes of
divine character. This becomes the
transcendent pattern for the family
organization and government of even the lowly
creatures of the worlds of space. (33:3.5-8).
Just as Michael and our Mother Spirit
recognize their new fundamentally equal and
mutual co-rulership of the universe, so too
must men and women move into an entirely
new stage of human existence on Urantia
```

whereby each acknowledges and respects the
equal rights of the other. We may have different
gender traits but we are equal as persons and
must be free to express our personalities in
society.

**THE URANTIA MOVEMENT**
In all the mustering of women, Mother
Spirit has not overlooked the women in the
Urantia movement. She seems to be calling
them, too. First, with the surprisingly
synchronous, separate yet simultaneous, rising
of the _West Coast Women’s Corps_ , the _Rocky
Mountain Women’s Corps_ , and the _East Coast
Women’s Corps_ ; then, more recently, with two
new groups, _Sisters in Spirit_ , and _Daughters of
God_. If you’ve had a chance to listen to the
serendipitous stories of the women involved,
you will know these groups did not come
together by chance, but rather by divine design.
Many Urantians of both genders report
perceiving our Universe Mother Spirit or
experiencing her presence. If you look with the
eyes of the spirit, you can see the Divine
Feminine moving in the world. It’s as though
we are beginning a new dispensation in which
women are being called to play a leadership
role – a role they were unable to play given the
religious and cultural restrictions on women
during the times of the Fourth Epochal
Revelation.

So why is our Universe Mother Spirit
gathering the women? How are Urantians, men
and women alike, uniquely positioned to help
her? What does she want us to do? As Urantia
Book readers of the Fifth Epochal Revelation,
Urantia Book readers have a wealth of
knowledge about Mother Spirit and her role in
the universe others do not have. We have been
given a treasure trove of information about the
divine pattern of male/female spiritual
partnership, and the relationship between
Michael/Jesus and Mother. Consider these
quotes:

```
6:8:1 "Concerning identity, nature, and
other attributes of personality, the
[Universal Mother] is the full equal, the
perfect complement, and the eternal
counterpart of the Universal Father."
133:2:2 "The Father in Heaven treats the
```
```
Spirit Mother of the children of the universe
as one equal to himself."
Almost no other faith tradition has a
theology acknowledging the Divine Feminine as
an equal co-partner to the Father in Heaven,
and that information is sorely needed in the
world. If Adam and Eve had not gone into
default, we would have had a role model of the
divine pattern for male/female spiritual and
social partnership in our Material Son and
Daughter that would have helped us to forego
the gender imbalance on our planet which has
been a root cause of so many problems. As it is,
we Urantians have a unique body of knowledge
that positions us to be of great assistance to our
Mother Spirit in her efforts to uplift our world
and move it towards Light and Life. As the true
and equal co-creative Mother spirit parent with
Michael, our Father spirit parent, this Universe
has been created, held and sustained by the co-
operative loving effort of both our Mother and
Father Spirits.
ARTICULATING THE DESIRES OF THE
DIVINE FEMININE
As we Urantian women sought Mother’s
presence to ask how we might help, we
contemplated how urgently the world needs a
shared vision of her values and goals.
Currently, there is a global rising tide of interest
in the Divine Feminine, but little knowledge
about her, or what she might want. Listing the
principles of the Divine Feminine can help all of
us come to know her better, and provide a
common standard by which the conduct of
individuals, businesses, corporations and
governments can be guided. Consequently, a
group of Urantian women came together to try
to articulate the desires of our Universe Mother
Spirit. Although we acknowledge that it is not
possible to know for certain what Mother Spirit
desires, and any list of her principles must
necessarily evolve over time as spiritual insight
and wisdom grow on the planet, we believe we
can be of service to her by drafting our best
understanding of her goals, inviting others to
participate and sharing that information with
them. Just as our Universe has a spiritual
Mother and Father, all of life and all of creation
is held in the eternal embrace of our loving and
supportive spiritual parents on high.
```

The written word can be very powerful.
When America’s founding fathers gathered in
Philadelphia in 1776 to promote their desire for
a fair and just government, the document they
produced, the _Declaration of Independence,_
forever changed global ideas about
government, rallied American patriots, and
shook our world. Unfortunately, no women
were present in Philadelphia, and John Adams
apparently ignored the pleas of his wife,
Abigail, to “remember the ladies” in her letter
urging him and other members of the
Continental Congress not to forget the nation’s
women when fighting for America’s
independence.

Other movements, too, have used a written
document to advance their cause. For example,
the Earth Charter is a document drafted by
multiple environmental groups working
together. The Charter outlines four principles
that are guidelines for environmentally
sustainable living and offer a vision of hope and
a call to action. Taken together, the principles
create a framework for building a just,
sustainable, and peaceful global society in the
21st century. The United Nations, too, used a
document to help achieve its aims. The
Millennium Development Goals were drafted
following the Millennium Summit in 2000, and
signed by all 191 member states of the United
Nations. The eight goals included the
eradication of extreme poverty and hunger,
universal primary education, the promotion of
gender equality, the reduction of child
mortality, improvements in maternal health,
more environmentally sustainable practices,
and the development of global partnerships.
The United Nations has since hailed the
Millennium Development Goals as “ _the most
successful anti-poverty movement in history.”_
The UN Secretary General recently explained
that they helped to lift more than one billion
people out of extreme poverty, made inroads
against hunger, and enabled more girls to
attend school than ever before.

At a women’s retreat held in October 2017
in California, Urantian women agreed to work
together over several months to attempt to
articulate Mother Spirit’s goals. The women
sought to raise awareness and appreciation for

```
the principles of the divine feminine, and help
restore gender balance. Their work produced
the document below:
PRINCIPLES OF THE DIVINE
FEMININE PREAMBLE
Women are rising as never before. Around
the world, they are gathering by the thousands
to march in the streets. They are mobilizing for
children’s welfare, gender equality, and social
justice. They demand an end to war, care for
the environment, equal pay, fair and equal
representation in government, and an end to
sexual harassment. In this time of great change
when our world trembles on the very brink of
global transformation, there is a growing
interest in the Divine Feminine. For many
centuries, the feminine aspects of deity have
been ignored and suppressed, leading to a
calamitous gender imbalance that is a root
cause below many of the global problems we
face. To evolve into a more caring and humane
world, it is critical that we acknowledge and
implement the principles of the Divine
Feminine to develop sustainable communities,
promote economic justice, restore gender
balance, and ultimately cultivate a culture of
peace.

part to play in healing and sustaining her with
love, reverence, and the best of our technology.
2. Women are the invaluable true co-
partners of men, and all of life is uplifted and
empowered when women are supported to
share their gifts and fill their rightful place.
3. Well balanced male/female relationships
reflect respect, caring, and gender equity,
recognize the vital contributions of each sex,
and assist in restoring gender balance in the
world. The Divine Feminine seeks healthy and
loving relationships between people of all sexes.
4. Every child is deeply cherished, and must
be nurtured and cared for to promote the
optimal physical, emotional, and spiritual well-
being of each individual and the whole.
5. As a mother hopes her children will treat
each other well, so the Divine Feminine yearns


for peace and harmony among her children on
Earth.

6. The highest wisdom within every faith
tradition is enhanced and ennobled when the
feminine aspects of the Divine are
acknowledged and celebrated.
7. Life is a sacred experience; cultivating
and living from a growing consciousness of the
divine is our ultimate opportunity and sacred
trust.

The document is meant to be a fluid work
that can evolve over time as we grow in our
understanding of what Mother Spirit wants.
The following women participated in helping to
create the “ _Principles of the Divine Feminine”:_

Susan Cook, Sharon Porter, Kaye Cooper,
Elisabeth Callahan, Lucretia Schanfarber, Barb
Maier, Mary Huggins, Alanna Tenney, Michelle
Klimesh, Conde Freeman, Meredith Tenney,
Cecilia Lampley, and Tommie Clendening.

An acknowledgement and celebration of the
Divine Feminine is critical for the restoration of
gender balance on the planet. As long as deity is
perceived as exclusively male, women will
always be second class citizens. Mother Spirit’s
influence is urgently needed in our world and in
drafting the _Principles of the Divine Feminine,_
we sought to articulate what she might want. By
bringing forth a declaration of the principles of
the Divine Feminine, we can assist in building a
shared vision of her values to guide a global
transformation that acknowledges and
celebrates her. We hope that it will inspire
discussion and thought about the goals and
desires of our Mother Spirit, our universe
parent and partner of our Creator Son, Michael
of Nebadon.

We plan to circulate the document widely
both within the Urantia movement and beyond
and believe it can be used to guide the
transition to a more just, sustainable and caring
world. When Michael was here on earth as a
bestowal son in the form of Jesus, he said, _“He
who has seen me, has seen the Father”_ (John
14:9). Mother, however, is omnipresent in
Nebadon and will never materialize in human
form where she could be seen and
acknowledged on our world. Given the loss of

```
our Material Daughter, Eve, our Universe
Mother Spirit is dependent on her human sons
and daughters to reflect her presence and make
her intentions known on Urantia. This is the
sacred task and awesome responsibility before
us in this planetary stage of evolution. Won’t
you assist us by joining in an exploratory
conversation about the will of our Universe
Mother Spirit, and sharing our best
understanding of her vision, goals, and desires
with others?
```
```
Since the start of the current millennium a
growing collective of women in the Urantia
movement began to dialogue in regional
meetings about the qualities of the Divine
Feminine and raising awareness of the reality
and presence of Our Universe Mother Spirit.
They were responding to the same call of the
Spirit as were hundreds of other women’s
groups throughout the nations of the world to
work for gender equality and the dignity of
women and all members of the human
family. Several Women's Corps groups sprung
up around the country a decade or more ago,
but the new energy of the current movement
began at IC '14 in Amherst when a group of
women spontaneously arose to serve Mother.
At the “Sisters in Spirit” retreat held in October
2017 in California, many Urantian women
agreed to work together over several months to
attempt to articulate our Mother Spirit’s goals.
That meeting was the impetus for this
collaborative article by spiritual sisters and
authors Meredith Tenney, Sharon Porter, Mary
Huggins and Elisabeth Callahan.

SUDDEN
TRANSFORMATION
is seldom sought or
courted, for human
beings prefer to tinker
carefully, cautiously,
slowly. This permits
them to conduct a
thorough review of
potential innovations
as they may affect a
structure thought
fundamentally sound.
When, however, has
the situation of Urantia been truly satisfactory,
either in conceptual or cosmic terms? Not since
Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia rebelled
approximately 200,000 years ago. Further, the
remedial measures that Adam and Eve
attempted fell far short of what they intended,
for the Material Son and Daughter ultimately
defaulted on their trust.

Although these defects and dilemmas had
endured for many millennia, by the opening
decades of the twentieth century there were
many aspects of human life on Urantia that
were already in crisis or rapidly hurtling toward
it. Therefore, our spiritual superiors who
sponsored the fifth epochal revelation
concluded that continuity was no longer an
option. Their arduous efforts to express
themselves in English eventually bequeathed us
extra­ordinary insights, but they also obliged us
to respond with the utmost imagination and
energy. In a memorandum dated January 19,
1955 that turned out to be as disconcerting as it
was incisive, William S. Sadler, Jr. vented his
profound preoccupations:

```
A cultural chrysalis in relation to
parochial and provincial thinking
A chrysalis is an interesting thing. It acts as
a sort of social or institutional incubator.
The social grouping of the Forum served as
a chrysalis for the ensuing Brotherhood. In
a much larger sense Protestant Christianity
serves as a chrysalis for the Urantia Papers.
```
```
The function of a chrysalis appears to be
inescapable, but the end products are not an
unmixed blessing.
For example, Judaism served as a chrysalis
for the gospel of Jesus. Without this chrys­
alis Jesus could not have taught. But this
chrysalis proved to be in some respects
embarrassing, not only to the gospel, but
even to Jesus himself.
The present problem. We as a group in the
Forum are nurtured in the teachings of
Protestant Christianity. And unless we make
a determined effort to do otherwise, we are
going to think in a parochial and in a
provincial manner.
I think we should make a sincere and
prayerful effort to rise above the bias which
is inherent in our backgrounds.
Sadler apparently intuited a key cosmic
reality: The fifth epochal revelation is neither
an outgrowth of Christianity, nor an appendix
to Christianity, nor Christianity 2.0. This
understanding attested to a momentous shift in
the spiritual paradigm, and the fact that Sadler
sensed it is impressive in itself. On the other
hand, these paragraphs of his give no hint that
he had internalized another paradigm shift that
was at least equally important: Rather than
focus almost entirely on spiritual and religious
matters, as had been the case during the
epochal revelations of Melchizedek of Salem
and Jesus of Nazareth, the revelators who
sponsored the fifth epochal revelation took
careful aim at the entire range of human life
and experience. When they did this, they
implicitly restored and re­vital­ized the
standard approach to epochal revelation on an
inhabited planet — a synthesis of many
methods whereby revelators do their utmost to
advance and upgrade all aspects of society and
civilization, not just spirituality and religion.
(In effect, the sponsors of epochal revelation
pursue the general plan for progressive
evolutionary growth that a Mighty Messenger
portrays in Paper 52, “Planetary Mortal
Epochs.”)
Now, over sixty years after William S.
```
Epochal Pathways


Sadler, Jr. typed his memorandum, we need to
interpret the social and cultural aspects of the
fifth epochal revelation as the gateway to an
entire millennium during which creative
innovators who desire to improve life on earth
will unceasingly imagine, invent, and
experiment, thereby helping the people of
Urantia begin overcoming the accumulated
backlog of unfinished tasks that still afflict us
because of the Caligastia betrayal and the
default of Adam and Eve. Along this path, these
innovators and the many other human beings
who cooperate with them will make substantial
contributions to the augmenting sovereignty of
God the Mother, the Supreme Being, the
evolving deity who sums and synthesizes all
realities and values on the finite level.

Nonetheless, we must not neglect the fifth
epochal revelation’s spiritual and religious
aspects, instead making sure to take careful
note of the mission and intent of our Paradise
Creator Son during the bestowal life he lived on
Urantia approximately 2,000 years ago. When
Jesus of Nazareth became fully aware of his
spiritual identity as Michael of Nebadon, he
undoubtedly treasured the assurance that
Immanuel offered him not long before he left
Salvington:

120:3.5 “As a dispensational Son you are
granted certain privileges pertaining to the
advancement of the _spiritual_ and _religious_
status of the world peoples.”
In the immediately succeeding paragraph,
however, Immanuel clarified the nature of
Michael’s task:

120:3.6 “5. As you may see fit, you are to
identify yourself with existing religious and
spiritual movements as they may be found
on Urantia but in every possible manner
seek to avoid the formal establishment of an
organized cult, a crystallized religion, or a
segregated ethical grouping of mortal
beings. Your life and teachings are to
become the common heritage of all religions
and all peoples.”
Therefore, Christ Michael of Nebadon,
incarnate in the human form of Jesus of
Nazareth, proclaimed and promoted _personal_
(individual) religion, as becomes luminously

```
clear when we study the discourses on religion
that the revelators enshrined in sections 5 and
6 of Paper 155. Nonetheless, we end up with the
impression that the apostles and their
successors stumbled at these advanced
teachings, for they went on to establish
organized, institutional frameworks in which
professional religionists issue orders to
believers and claim to speak for God. This, of
course, was profoundly at odds with what Jesus
taught. After all, he declared:
153:2.6 “I have come to proclaim spiritual
liberty, teach eternal truth, and foster living
faith.”
Further, Jesus explicitly enjoined his
apostles and other followers not to create
legends and build up a cult having to do with
beliefs and teachings about his beliefs and
teachings (138:6.3). Nonetheless, they did. In
addition, Jesus emphasized spiritual unity,
while repeatedly warning against creeds and
traditions that would serve to guide and control
believers:
141:5.4 Many times during the training of
the twelve Jesus reverted to this theme.
Repeatedly he told them it was not his
```
```
Dreams by Wassilij Dimitriewitsch Polenow
```

```
desire that those who believed in him
should become dogmatized and
standardized in accordance with the
religious interpretations of even good men.
Again and again he warned his apostles
against the formulation of creeds and the
establishment of traditions as a means of
guiding and controlling believers in the
gospel of the kingdom.
Even so, his followers and their successors
succumbed to these temptations too.
In seeking to appraise the net outcomes, the
Midwayer Commission comments:
195:10.11 The visible church should refuse
longer to handicap the progress of the
invisible and spiritual brotherhood of the
kingdom of God. And this brotherhood is
destined to become a living organism in
contrast to an institutionalized social
organization.
If we now endeavor to compile and
summarize all these factors, it is reasonable to
conclude that the revelators have left us two
overarching questions:
```
1. When will committed readers of _The
Urantia Book_ concentrate their energies on
_living_ the true teachings of Jesus?
2. When will they _also_ devote substantial
energy and attention to promoting the
progressive growth and development of society
and civilization, thereby making their own
personal contributions to the evolving
sovereignty of the Supreme Being on Urantia of
Satania in Norlatiadek of Nebadon?

There was a time when
the religion of a culture
defined a person
throughout life. No
choice was presented as
a part of his
socialization. This was
never to be questioned.
Though there may have
been doubt and
skepticism, few in any
established society dared questioned the
dominant religious paradigm.

With the exception of the rare appearances
of prophets with new revelations, questioning
scholars and the experiences of mystics, this
norm continued for most of the planet’s history
until the early 20th century. During this time of
enlightenment, new revelations arose, great
spiritual teachers appeared, and esoteric
knowledge blossomed. Many teachers of
various religious orientations, such as
Paramahansa Yogananda (a Hindu) and Hazrat
Anayat Khan (a Sufi), both of India, came to the
West and began to attract serious students. As
this esoteric knowledge became more accessible
and education improved, many people now had
alternatives to the religions of their forbearers,
as well as secularism. Into this fertile ground
came the revelation known as _The Urantia
Book_ , first published in 1955.

Intended for future generations when
individual spirituality would become the
desirable goal, _The Urantia Book_ has attracted
people from diverse backgrounds and continues
to be translated into many languages for truth
seekers all over the planet. Still not widely
known, an active community of readers has
become established nevertheless, coming
together to study, meeting in conference-style
forums in university settings and in small
groups in private homes. Because _The Urantia
Book_ is not a religion, there has been a strong
resistance against making it into a formal

```
religion or ‘church’ of Urantia Book readers.
Most UB students are not traditional
religionists, and there are those who choose not
to participate in any formal religion.
As revealed in Part IV, “Jesus founded a
religion of personal experience in doing the will
of God and serving the human brotherhood.”*
He understood that human beings are social
creatures and would naturally want to come
together as fellow believers. Sadly, as the new
religion called Christianity evolved, his
profound teachings were watered down,
replaced almost entirely by the facts of his life,
death and resurrection. Even though
“Christianity contains enough of Jesus’
teachings to immortalize it,”* “the New
Testament is a superb Christian document, but
it is only meagerly Jesusonian.”*
The Urantia Book introduces a cosmology
and explains in detail the presence of God
Within, called the ‘Thought Adjuster,’ a
fragment of the Father Himself that indwells
our minds. The Holy Spirit spoken of in the
Christian gospels is actually the Spirit of Truth
sent by Jesus at the time of Pentecost, which is
en-circuited with the spirit of the Universal
Mother Spirit, the Holy Spirit, within each
human being. Through these concepts of the
divine bestowals revealed in the revelation, we
are given the framework within which to
develop a true personal religion with a deeper
relationship with the Father and with our Local
Universe Co-Creators, Michael (Jesus) and the
Universal Mother Spirit. Jesus’ teachings
encourage us to worship and pray, making
God’s Will our own.
How does this 2,097-page masterpiece
become a spiritual path? It depends on each
person’s dedication and the leadings from his
own indwelling Mystery Monitor. The greatest
influence is one’s spiritual hunger, whether he
joins a study group and continues to focus on
the book intellectually, or comes to internalize
the truths over time, developing a personal
relationship with the Father Fragment and the
```
_The Urantia Book_

A Spiritual Path


Local Universe Parents. Only then does doing
the Will of the Heavenly Father become a true
desire and therefore every effort made to know
and submit to the Father’s will. ‘Thy will (not
_my_ will) be done.’

The psychic circles, as described in the
book, are levels of spiritual attainment and are
highly individualistic. Each person has his own
soul plan, with his Thought Adjuster guiding,
and his accompanying angels helping him with
whatever life lessons he needs in order to climb
the circles.

Initially, the person is immersed in life and
is usually not actually aware of the presence of
unseen assistance; however, as the individual
develops his inner ‘observer,’ (soul) he can
often begin to perceive God’s presence in his
life, growing accordingly from his insights. He
will then no longer evolve primarily through
suffering and life shocks. Subsequently, life
lessons can become gentler, though no less
profound, bringing new wisdom and building
‘fruits of the spirit.’

It has been said that any new religion
follows four stages of development: ‘The Man,
the Message, the Movement, and the
Monument.’ Although most great religions and
authentic spiritual paths originate by divine
revelation to a saintly human being, often
called a prophet, _The Urantia Book_ has no
human teacher; rather, there is the historical
Jesus and the Inner Teacher, the indwelling
Thought Adjuster, a spirit fragment of the
Father Himself.

The message is not typical either. It is a vast
collection of profound truths, including esoteric
concepts of the nature of God, extensive
information about a friendly, highly-organized
Universe and Hierarchy, a detailed history of
the planet and its fall, and of course, the
reintroduction of Jesus’ matchless teachings
with a faithful retelling of his life on earth. This
amazing revelation is authored by various
Celestials who identify themselves at the end of
each paper.

There is a loosely organized ‘movement,’
which has sometimes been fragmented, with
little historical support for building one central
institution (the monument). Publishing,

```
translation, dissemination and study are the
purposes of The Urantia Book Fellowship and
The Urantia Foundation, the two primary
organizations, with each student responsible
for his own inner guidance and personal choice
as to how he is to study, worship, serve, and
pursue spiritual practices such as prayer and
meditation. Smaller independent organizations
with various focuses, such as spiritual retreats,
youth ministry, outreach, validation of the
revelation, continuing transmissions from
celestials, formal education, and intentional
community, continue to be created as
expressions of service - the community in
action.
According to the book, worship and service
are both necessary to one’s spiritual life if the
soul is to continue to grow closer to God.
Indeed, more can often be accomplished
spiritually through active service than through
worship, according to the revelation. Jesus
taught his disciples to pray alone, silently. The
seeking for and communing with the God
Within is encouraged over group worship and
formal prayers.
Is it actually possible for a common set of
religious practices to be developed and
duplicated for those who read the book?
Probably not, as each person’s soul plan is
unique. However, support groups could be
established based on a common need or desire
to share one’s inner path with others. This
seems to be the next logical step for some fully-
developed study groups, along with occasional
participation in spiritual retreats where the
inner life is fostered, based on the truths of the
revelation. True community can be enhanced
through group service activities in addition to
study, worship and sharing. Attending local
groups and larger regional, national and
international gatherings helps one to feel a part
of the greater movement, developing strong
connections to kindred spirits, which in turn
helps to create a stronger Urantia Family of
Believers.
So, what do we call ourselves now?
When Urantia Book students come together
as one in spirit, what would be the name that
best describes this collective? The
```

term,‘ _Urantia Book_ readers’ sounds like
members of a book club. Similarly, Christians
are not called ‘Bible readers.’ The designation,
‘Jesusonians’ seems more desirable, denoting
not a formal organization but the spiritual
collective that naturally comes together when
one believes and follows the original teachings
of Jesus as revealed in _The Urantia Book_.

What Jesus called the ‘Father’s Kingdom’ is
actually the vast spiritual brotherhood of all
spirit-indwelt mortals who choose to do the will
of the Father, not the human ‘church’ as it was
conceived by the Apostle Paul. The ‘Kingdom of
Heaven’ sounds archaic to a modern world
where ruling monarchies have almost
disappeared and the ideals of democracy and
equality are valued, if not always practiced.
Regardless of our religious affiliations, we are
all part of that great ‘cosmic collective,’ which is
experienced spiritually. No formal membership
is required. In the term, ‘Universal
Brotherhood,’ the word, ‘brotherhood’ is gender
specific and therefore no longer ‘politically
correct.’ Why not say, ‘Universal Unity?’ The
Kingdom could become the ‘Father’s Family,’ as
we are all brothers and sisters, his children,
implying an even closer relationship than the

```
word ‘kingdom,’ which denotes a form of
human government.
Maybe it’s time to begin to use new words
for our spiritual connections. The way we do
that is to simply begin using them in our
everyday language. A book that was first
written in the English language of the 1930’s is
still a mighty revelation, full of profound truth.
It is suggested, therefore that the language be
modified verbally to suit modern sensitivities
and sensibilities.

Recognizing the
instructional shift
needed for revelation
based education that
empowers morontian
growth of Jesusonians
and fosters the spiritual
unity and human
diversity of the Urantia
Movement.
_by Dr. Bruce R.
Jackson_
Many members of the Urantia Movement
(UM) who have a passion for education have
long wrestled with a significant teaching and
learning challenge when dealing with the
development of an effective educational system
based on _The Urantia Book_ (UB). While most
of us have been a product of traditional

```
teaching methods such as lecture, homework,
testing, research, etc., we are all deeply
challenged to evolve beyond our traditional
educational experience into an instructional
methodology that fosters an individualized
spiritual growth experience and cultivates the
emergence of a group experience of morontial
living based on a union of souls.
This instructional shift from information
analysis, proof text research, discussion groups,
and UB quotation towards the development of
an ascendant morontian experience contains
the potential for soul awakening and spiritual
rebirth in individuals, the classroom group, and
with the UM at large. The achievement of
balance between traditional instructional
techniques and the promotion of spiritual
growth is a significant challenge facing our
revelation based education. As we develop and
```
The Challenge of Revelation Based Education


grow our schools, we are endeavoring to go
beyond personal religious expression into the
realms group experience where the spiritual
impact of a union of souls guides the
instruction of the Fifth Epochal Revelation
(5ER).

**A similar problem found public
education**
For many years American higher education
has been confronted with a very similar
problem. With the advent of online
instructional delivery systems in higher
education we are challenged by a new emphasis
on individual lifelong learning. Teachers are
increasingly confronted by instructional
methods that are outdated and ineffective even
though such methods were part of their own
educational training. While “sage on stage”
teaching is fair at delivering basic information,
it is not good at delivering an applied
experience. For example, lectures on music
history and theory may fill in gaps in student
knowledge, but without applied lessons and
experiential ensembles where musical
objectives are learned, practiced, and
performed, lectures and other traditional
instructional techniques do not prepare skilled
musicians.

American educational institutions struggle
with the balance between traditional
instruction vs. applied experience in the
attempt to balance the need to make money to
pay bills by teaching large groups of students
vs. teaching individuals with unique needs.
There is great institutional sacrifice when
committing to the creative development of
individual students because it requires
expensive instructional mentoring, more
intimate class settings, uncommon levels of
institutional empathy through personalized
academic advising, and entirely new
approaches to inter-institutional cooperation
rarely practiced in academia.

Morality is increasingly becoming a major
concern of public educational institutions as it
attempts to break the tread-mill approach to
mass instruction while meeting the lifelong
learning needs of individuals. In the current
amoral climate of modern society, it is easy to

```
make promises that are not sustainable.
Though community colleges tend to fare better
than their state university colleagues, they are
deeply challenged with their tremendously
diverse and needy student populations. True,
mentoring and other one-on-one instructional
methods are personnel intensive and expensive,
but overworked adult students limited by
schedule, family, finances, and the inability to
avail themselves of personal opportunities that
are already available is a dilemma that
frustrates well-intentioned academics who
strive to shift into a more personalized method
of teaching.
Our school teachers work hard to
personalize instruction, but numbers driven
education is difficult to overcome in this age of
spreadsheets, bean counter administrators, and
results oriented thinking. While the more
traditional approaches may be easier to test and
quantify than personal development, educators
know that applied instruction has much deeper
life consequences.
The experience of religious education
Seminaries have long incorporated
traditional educational methodology while they
simultaneously strive to provide an
environment of spiritual development. For any
worthy seminary, spiritual training is equally, if
not more important than knowledge-based
instruction. Most seminaries have organized
periods of worship and prayer, a plethora of
personal and group spiritual experiences, and
long list of service opportunities as an essential
part of the curriculum of spiritual development
of each student.
There is a reason why many seminary
degrees require three years; that extended
timeframe may be needed for significant
spiritual growth and the many valuable
experiences needed to prepare for ministry.
Yet, even for seminaries contained within this
spiritual focus is a problem: a one-size-fits-all
approach to spirituality resulting in
denominationalism. Christian seminaries are
particularly prone to this and it may well be one
reason why church worship styles often become
fixed and inflexible: what ministers learn in
seminary before ordination is what takes place
```

in worship in their church.

Most seminaries have found that morality
training is particularly difficult. When engaging
in moral teaching it is all too easy to become
dictators of lifestyles, arbitrators of religious
perspective, and gatekeepers of the “right” way.
Denominationalism generally fails to embrace
diversity in religious expression as it often
places limits on spiritual experience as defined
by a church. It is difficult enough to create an
atmosphere of individual exploration when
dealing with knowledge based instruction;
cultivating an environment of Spirit-led
morontian growth is a much greater challenge.

For example: after my five years of seminary
training where I had developed a record of trust
through church service, teaching, and a
significant missionary effort. The challenge my
seminary faced when they discovered that I had
read the UB before entering seminary was more
than my institution could deal with. With only
six months left on a Doctor of Music Ministry, I
was forced to leave after refusing to publicly
denounce the UB. The seminary forced me to
leave in utter secrecy in fear of my testimony to
colleagues and my students.

**Revelation as the educational foundation
of UM schools**
The UM is facing a similar dilemma as we
develop an educational system that offers a
morontian level spiritual experience while
providing a strong informational curriculum
based on the 5ER. We all have experience with
the “sage on stage” instructional method and its
temptation to love to be the “great teacher”
imparting knowledge. But as we gain
experience with our new online schools, we
have learned through hard lessons the
importance of avoiding spiritual-egos,
judgement of others, argumentative modes of
expression, and the imposition of revelatory
interpretation on sincere and diverse truth
seekers.

As ascendant beings we need our brothers
and sisters to observe, mentor, share, learn
from, and teach each other. To be spiritually
healthy we must not only attend to our
courtship with our Indwelling Adjuster and
enhance our intellectual knowledge of the UB,

```
we must also join with our brothers, sisters,
and superhuman fellows in universal service as
human-morontial beings. We were not created
to be alone and isolated in our personal
religious life – we truly need each other to grow
in spiritual consciousness.
Even so, in this renaissance era of diversity
this is a challenging task. The UM will
increasingly struggle with different cultural
interpretations of the 5ER. It will find
discomfort in the ever expanding and
unfamiliar approaches to worship, meditation,
and prayer. It will continue to be deeply
challenged by its far-flung population and
suffer from the lack of close-knit local social
groups. In this environment the UM must
become more spiritual in expression and
culture as it evolves its educational system into
effective cooperative and complementary
teaching institutions.
The UM is at a serious crossroads that will
require some creative solutions in order to
develop the spiritual education suggested
herein. There are two things that will be vitally
important to that effort: the promotion of
corporate services of worship, meditation, and
prayer on an international scale. We live in
such an age of disconnection we all deeply need
a broad spiritual communion. Churches such as
Unity and online seminaries have long
demonstrated that it is quite possible to do this.
We have internet tools that are able to connect
us around the globe, and we need to use them
in promoting services of worship, meditation,
and prayer to spiritually unite the diverse
Jesusonians of the world. Such an experience of
spiritual unity through worship, meditation,
and prayer will truly change the public nature
of our faith expression and the UM.
The impact of spiritual consciousness
growth in UM education
Guy Perron suggests that “there are
powerful elements of psycho-spiritual work
that unfold when students are engaged in this
soul-expansion as we recognize what is
blocking the emergence of our consciousness.”
The art of consciousness instruction is a
mentoring, shared, supportive, and mutual
experience of spiritual evolution where “all
```

ships in the harbor rise with the tide.” There are
as many different methods of consciousness
training as there are people as it requires a
sustained commitment to a spiritual experience
resulting from strong interpersonal and
mentoring relationships. There is no one
“right” way to do this, only a way that is Spirit-
led.

Teaching the soul rather than the subject
must be founded on worship, meditation,
prayer, service, and a connection with all
Thought Adjusters. It must be based on the
teachings of our Sovereign through the
essential leadership of the Spirit of Truth. It
must be focused on cultivating an
understanding of how to apply the
incomparable teachings of the UB in a practical
way that impacts daily living that is flexible
enough for spiritual individualization. This
level of consciousness training requires that
each brother and sister internally grow his/her
embryonic soul-consciousness under the
guidance of their Indwelling Will of the Father
while simultaneously growing externally thru a
communal and universal experience of the inter

- connectedness of human and superhuman
beings living in kinship with our Mother
Supreme. Through these parental relationships
the siblinghood of human brothers and sisters
along with our unseen universal helpers and
guardian angels is fully realized in the form of a
union of souls.

As our revelatory educational institutions
develop, fulfilling the 5ER’s spiritual mission of
uniting souls in kinship with the Family of God
presents a real inter-institutional challenge. We
should embrace cooperative institutional
sharing of a spiritual educational mission that
augments and uplifts the UM with a renewed
and revitalized spiritual and universal purpose.
In any young movement it is inevitable that
unique groups will emerge, and this is a good
thing.

141:5.1 "I have come into the world to
proclaim spiritual liberty to the end that
mortals may be empowered to live
individual lives of originality and freedom
before God. I do not desire that social
harmony and fraternal peace shall be
purchased by the sacrifice of free
```
```
personality and spiritual originality. What I
require of you, my apostles, is spirit unity—
and that you can experience in the joy of
your united dedication to the wholehearted
doing of the will of my Father in heaven.
You do not have to see alike or feel alike or
even think alike in order spiritually to be
alike. Spiritual unity is derived from the
consciousness that each of you is indwelt,
and increasingly dominated, by the spirit
gift of the heavenly Father. Your apostolic
harmony must grow out of the fact that the
spirit hope of each of you is identical in
origin, nature, and destiny.”
Providing service opportunities as a
fundamental objective of the Urantia
Movement
One of the most serious problems facing the
UM today is the fact that we all live in an age of
ambivalent indifference; to ignore the UB is
just so very easy. For that reason, Jesusonians
need to unite, work, share, and develop as a
group in spiritual unity and cooperative
association guided by mutual respect,
consistent support, collegiality, and
collaborative thinking. An isolated go-it-alone
approach will only result in the continued
ambivalence and indifference of the world. In
contrast, if Jesusonians become a spiritually
united thru their organizations celebrating
diversity and modeling a spiritual union of
souls, then that lesson will offer a stark contrast
to the troubled earth-bound perspective that
currently dominates our modern society.
Inbreeding is a problem that any new
organization faces, and the UM is no exception.
Many modern churches face a similar situation:
the “40-year pew warmer” who feels entitled
and in control. At this stage in the life of the
UM we have found, like most churches, that
growing a group of “like-minded” individuals is
rarely able to cope with diversity and social
differences. The UM is increasingly developing
an “in-crowd” mentality where strangers need
not apply.
My personal experience with UM is
instructive on this matter. For over three years
I have proposed courses, written thousands of
words in online classes, and have published
```

articles on education in the hope that I may
share my 30-year experience in higher
education as a music teacher and
administrator. My work has largely been
ignored, and I have even been told to “go
away.” Frankly, if a third generation academic/
minister with expertise in curricular
development having written accreditation
materials for two collages and a university is of
no interest to the curricular development of our
UB based schools, then they need to reconsider
their loss as I suspect my experience was
unremarkable.

While it is clear to me that my UM
experience is neither personal nor vindictive, it
does indicate a failure of UM institutions to
meet the central objective of their mission: to
offer sincere pilgrims a place of real service.
Our schools are now facing a significant task
that will need the expertise of many, many
people. Any educational system based on the
work of a “chosen few” will only perpetrate
mistakes that have been made in the past. The
UM tends to “shoot itself in the foot” when it
comes to outsiders. As long as the UM remains
dominated by a small clique incapable of
offering expansive service opportunities for the
widely diverse peoples that arrive at their
doorstep, the UM will continue to age, weaken,
falter, and fail to grow. It is no surprise that
after over 65 years the UM is facing inbreeding,
and many churches from a wide variety of
Christian denominations have had very similar
experiences. Nonetheless, this is an issue needs
serious attention.

**Conclusion**
In our enthusiasm for developing spiritual
experience in our revelatory education, we are
fully aware that traditional instructional
methods will continue to be employed where
appropriate because we are rightly reluctant to
“throw the baby out with the bathwater.” Even
so, we are seeking courses that create an
environment where the Will of God becomes
the center of focus, the experience of the
Mother Supreme is enhanced, the teachings of
Jesus are truly experienced and lived, and the
guidance of the Spirit binds both human and
superhuman forces in unified universal
purpose. We seek a revelatory education where

```
unseen helpers are sought out for guidance and
direction, where angelic guardians facilitate our
activities to promote spiritual objectives, and
all our Divine Adjusters are fully engaged by
the dedication of our mortal wills. To achieve
this level of consciousness training requires our
united choice as individuals and as an
organized movement committed to living the
teachings of the UB through prayer, worship,
and service. If our revelatory education
achieves those objectives, then our trust in the
morontian experience will deepen as individual
Jesusonians, as groups, and as the Urantia
Movement.

87:7.5- (^9) In the past, truth has grown
rapidly and expanded freely when the cult
has been elastic, the symbolism expansile.
Regardless of the drawbacks and handicaps,
every new revelation of truth has given rise
to a new cult, and even the restatement of
the religion of Jesus must develop a new
and appropriate symbolism. Modern men
and women must find some adequate
symbolism for their new and expanding
ideas, ideals, and loyalties. This enhanced
symbol must arise out of religious living,
spiritual experience. And this higher
symbolism of a higher civilization must be
predicated on the concept of the Fatherhood
of God and be pregnant with the mighty
ideal of the brotherhood and sisterhood of
humanity. The new cult must, like the old,
foster sentiment, satisfy emotion, and
promote loyalty; but it must do more: it
must facilitate spiritual progress, enhance
cosmic meanings, augment moral values,
encourage social development, and
stimulate a high type of personal religious
living. The new cult must provide supreme
goals of living which are both temporal and
eternal—social and spiritual. If the new cult
could only be dynamic instead of static, it
might really contribute something
worthwhile to the progress of humankind,
both temporal and spiritual.

_by David Kantor_
It is not uncommon to
hear a reader of _The
Urantia Book_ expressing
an ideal of being able to
assist our unseen friends
in some way with their
work. Too often this
doesn't go much beyond
imagining what it would be like to be a
reservist. But there are some very deep spiritual
needs and cosmically compelling service
potentials in our world with repercussions
extending far beyond this life.

This article will provide background on the
present planetary dispensation and highlight
once again the Master's plea to each of his
followers—his kingdom service imperative. On
isolated Urantia, the journey to light and life
may be highly dependent on the mobilization of
dedicated mortals.

**Dispensations**
The Urantia Book describes planetary
history as a sequence of dispensations. What is
a dispensation? The first section of Paper 115
contains a discussion of “universe frames”—
contexts, paradigms, or frames of reference
within which we do our thinking. Imagine a
dispensation as a “metaframe” embodying
administrative goals for guiding planetary
evolution through a specific stage of
development.

There have been four dispensations on our
planet:

- The Era of the Life Carriers
- The Dispensation of the Planetary Prince
- The Adamic Dispensation
    - The Dispensation of the Spirit of Truth—
    the current dispensation.
    Among other purposes a dispensation may
be thought of as providing:
1. _A tool for celestial management of mortal
orientation to the ascension career_.
Dispensations provide structured
conceptual environments within which
evolutionary growth takes place. At the
beginning of each dispensation divine Sons
inaugurate potentials which then are
developed during the dispensation by
mortals responding to the leading of
superhuman ministry.
2. _A tool for managing the superhuman
planetary administration_. Planetary
administrative priorities are structured to
work within the context of the goals and
objectives of a particular dispensation. At
the start of a new dispensation the
superhuman elements of planetary
administration get reorganized relative to
the advancing goals set by the initiating
divine Son.
3. _A tool for integrating planetary
evolution with administrative affairs on the
Mansion Worlds_. Rehabilitation services,
social mechanisms, educational programs,
planetary and local system administration
procedures–all need to be planned, created,
staffed, and put in place in readiness for
new groups of pilgrims arriving from the
evolutionary planets.
It is possible that dispensations also provide
a means for synchronizing the flow of groups
into the Constellation educational regime.
**The Present Dispensation on Urantia**
The present dispensation on Urantia is the

Mobilizing a Dispensation of Planetary Rehabilitation


dispensation of the bestowed Spirit of Truth,
the Comforter, that 34:4.5 “spiritual force which
ever draws all truth seekers towards Him who
is the personification of truth in the local
universe.” On Urantia neither personal spiritual
experience nor the development of civilization
can ever be the same again.

Mighty spiritual forces have been unleashed
for access by individual mortals including the
Spirit of Truth and the universal bestowal of
Thought Adjusters. But the effectiveness of
these resources for planetary rehabilitation
depends on cooperative participation by
individual mortals functioning within the
material and interpersonal environment of the
planet.

What can we discern regarding superhuman
intentions for the present dispensation?
Reviewing the purposes of the guiding Spirit of
Truth illuminates the matter beyond question.

```
194:2.1 “The Spirit of Truth is designed to
live in man and, for each new generation, to
restate the Jesus message so that every new
group of mortals to appear upon the face of
the earth shall have a new and up-to-date
version of the gospel.”
194:3.5 “The Spirit of Truth was bestowed
for the purpose of qualifying believers more
effectively to preach the gospel of the
kingdom.”
194:2.6 “The Spirit of Truth came to help
the believer to witness to the realities of
Jesus' teachings and his life as he lived it in
the flesh and as he now again lives it anew
and afresh in the individual believer of each
passing generation of the spirit-filled sons
of God.”
178:1.6 “The fruits of the spirit, your
sincere and loving service, are the mighty
social lever to uplift the races of darkness,
and this Spirit of Truth will become your
power-multiplying fulcrum.”
191:5.3 “When you shall have been
baptized with the Spirit of Truth, you will
bravely and joyously go forth to meet the
new experiences of proclaiming the good
news of eternal life in the kingdom of God.”
```
```
The primary task of the present
dispensation is to foster global consciousness of
the kingdom. Said Jesus, 176:2.5 “You should
understand that, when this gospel of the
kingdom shall have been proclaimed to all the
world for the salvation of all peoples, and when
the fullness of the age has come to pass, the
Father will send you another dispensational
bestowal, or else the Son of Man will return to
adjudge the age.”
Fostering a world-wide appreciation for the
kingdom will create the foundation upon which
the revelation of the next dispensation will take
place. But the achievement of this planetary
recovery will be heavily dependent on mortal
commitment and work over many generations.
The Spirit of Truth is a resource that will
facilitate the work of the Master's followers who
choose to accept his commission. This is the
Master's personal spirit working in the world to
actualize potentials planted during his
prematurely terminated Incarnation. And we
are commissioned by him to work in
partnership with his bestowed spirit.
He has provided powerful spiritual
resources--the Spirit of Truth, the global
mobilization of Thought Adjusters, and more.
He has reorganized the superhuman planetary
government to address the task. And he has
provided us with an epochal revelation, a
kingdom worker's manual containing context,
instructions, and guidance.
Do we fully appreciate being personally
asked by our Creator Son to help him
rehabilitate this isolated, sin-stricken planet?
As he emphatically instructed the Seventy, 163:4.2
“The gospel of the kingdom must be proclaimed
to all the world.”
The Revolutionary Nature of His
Teaching
The teachings of Jesus brought a
revolutionary new perspective to one of the
most pressing questions of his day; “What must
I do to be saved?”
The Hebrews taught adherence to the Law
of Moses as the means of gaining favor with
Yahweh.
```

The Romans taught political loyalty and
service to the State.

The Greeks valued virtue and taught the
construction of a soul through the cultivation of
philosophical thought.

The mystery religions focused on the
observance of ritual.

Jesus shifted the locus of spiritual attention
to _personality_ , a revolutionary departure from
the religious paradigms of mind, law, and ritual
of his day. His teachings immerse the believer
in a milieu in which the primacy of
interpersonal relationships prevails—our
relationship with God and our relationships
with each other. And this milieu of
spiritualizing communion between persons is
the environment within which his spiritual
kingdom may be discovered.

It has been said that the Greeks discovered
mind mobilized by the development of rational
thought. The teachings of Jesus constitute
nothing less than a revelation of personality
mobilized by selfless service.

**Jesus' Personal Philosophy of Living**
The Beatitudes are reflective of Jesus'
personal philosophy of living. They illuminate
qualities of spiritual being implicit in his
teaching. Be humble, thirst for righteousness,
be meek, and be pure in heart. These four
beatitudes describe ideals of _personal being_.

In the domain of _social being_ , he places a
high value on serving people, comforting them,
being merciful, being a peacemaker, being
willing to stand up for righteousness, doing
good rather than forcefully resisting evil—even
to the extent of loving one's enemies.

The fruits of the spirit are experienced only
as these attitudes of personality are actually
lived. Loving service, unselfish devotion,
courageous loyalty, sincere fairness,
enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding
trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness,
and forgiving tolerance can only be experienced
in relationships with other persons.

Jesus was teaching neither a doctrine nor an
ideology. Neither was he trying to found a
religion. This was our Creator, incarnate, telling

```
us how reality works in a personal universe;
how to grow and thrive as persons in a world
with other persons. He was revealing
personality itself as the very ground of being.
The dispensation he was inaugurating was one
in which 179:5.2 “the enslaved individual emerges
from the bondage of ceremonialism and
selfishness into the spiritual joy of the
brotherhood and fellowship of the liberated
faith sons of the living God.”
This was our Creator who came “that we
might have life and have it more abundantly.”
Participation
But note that this Spirit of Truth 34:5.5 “is
almost wholly limited in function and power by
man's personal reception of that which
constitutes the sum and substance of the
mission of the bestowal Son.”
What might that “sum and substance” be?
137:8.6 “I have come to proclaim the
establishment of the Father's kingdom.”
```
```
Jesus Washing the Feet of his Disciples
by Albert Gustaf Aristides Edelfelt
```

137:8.14 “I have come to preach the glad
tidings of the kingdom.”
145:3.9 “I have come into the world to
reveal the Father and establish his
kingdom.”
140:6.6 “I have come not to reform the
kingdoms of this world but rather to
establish the kingdom of heaven.”
And what might our “personal reception” of
his mission look like?

129:3.5 [Jesus was] “dedicated to the work
of revealing the heavenly Father to his
fellow mortals and at the same time was
consecrated to the sublime task of living his
mortal earth life all the while subject to the
will of the same Paradise Father.”
Our “personal reception” of his mission—
our assimilation of his religion—implies the
embodiment and expression through our own
lives of his personal spiritual objectives. In this
regard we should note that, 160:5.3 “If something
has become a religion in your experience, it is
self-evident that you already have become an
active evangel of that religion since you deem
the supreme concept of your religion as being
worthy of the worship of all mankind, all
universe intelligences. If you are not a positive
and missionary evangel of your religion, you
are self-deceived in that what you call a religion
is only a traditional belief or a mere system of
intellectual philosophy.”

Not only does our personal reception of his
mission further the process of planetary
rehabilitation; our personalities become more
real as we engage with the spiritual trends
and objectives of the present dispensation.
Ascent through the psychic circles is
directly related to mastering the
personality challenges inherent in the
tasks of the kingdom. Here in our initial
lives in the flesh, kingdom service and
personal growth are all provided in an
integrated career package available for the
choosing.

Do we appreciate the magnitude of the
universe career option being offered to us?
We are Agondonters being invited to join a
corps of planetary ministers working in the

```
wake of the Creator Son's final bestowal and
attainment of universe sovereignty; we are
mortals given an epochal revelation containing
background and guidelines for helping with
planetary rehabilitation. We are the boots on
the ground with the ability directly to engage
individuals and impact institutions in a way
that is impossible for our unseen friends.
Our Creator Son has commissioned us to
work for the establishment of his spiritual
kingdom on earth—what an exciting
adventure! What faith he has in us!
The dispensation of the Spirit of Truth
under the transcendent guidance of Michael's
personal spirit will be a time of great transition
during which our troubled world will begin
more fully to embrace the forward progressive
march of evolution in Nebadon. It is a march
toward light and life and the fuller realization of
the kingdom proclaimed by Jesus, catalyzed by
the commitments of countless generations of
his faithful followers.
Will the story of your universe career show
that you were a creative participant or merely
an observer? All Urantia is waiting.
