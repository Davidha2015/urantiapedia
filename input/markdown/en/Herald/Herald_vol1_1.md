**TEE MOST RECENT COLNT (MS THE TOTAL NUMBER OF**

books published by Urantia Foundation as over 400,000
since 1955. The Fellowship's short-lived publishing ven-
ture, undertaken while the book was briefly in public
domain, produced an additional 15,000 copies. The
Foundation currently sells about 20,000 per year, the
great majority of which are sold through major distribu-
**FTORI** publication in 1955 to 1975, almost 58,000
books were sold or given as gifts. Between 1976 and
1979 sales averaged 10,000 per year. There had been a

price increase in 1977 from $20.00 to $26.00 because of inflation, but it did not affect sales significantly. The real plunge in sales occurred after 1979 when the price of the book was raised to $34.00. From 1980 through 1986, sales did not meet the 10,000 mark per yea

The Foundation's new soft cover version, a liber­alized distribution system, more translations available, wider awareness, and demand have pushed annual sales over 20,000. +

**The Internet, a New Medium of Dissemination**

hi _URANIA BCOK I_ **IAS NOT BEEN KTORID**  **BY Ti t**

explosion of the computer and the Internet. Currently _ **The Urania Book** _ is the focus of web sites as well as discussion lists and chat groups.

The Urania Foundation's web page is located at [www.utantia.org](http://www.utantia.org/) Among its many features are confer­ence information, study aids, newsletters and archives, international news and links to International Urantia Associations and offices around the world. It also con­tains the complete version of the Urantia Book with search engine.

The Fellowship's web page can be found at [www.ubfellowship.org](http://www.ubfellowship.org/). It is maintained by David Kantor, of Lafayette California, and is truly a labor of love. The complete text of the English and Spanish editions of the Urantia Book can be found along with current events and conference news. The site is rich with his­tory featuring photographs of the early days, historical papers and even a transcript of the Bill Sadler Jr. talks given to study groups in the '50s. This information is invaluable to every reader interested in the background and history of _ **The Unman Book.** _

Also on the Fellowship site is information about the various discussion lists and chat groups that are available. Some have definite guide lines and restrict discussion to just _ **The Urantia Book.** _ Others are unaf­filiated and encourage open discussion where just about anything goes. Be forewarned that discussions on these lists can be political and heated discourse is often the fare. The Fellowship site also includes information about local societies and their activities.

Urantia Books can be purchased on-line through the web sites of several bookstores, the largest being [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com/). You can help raise money for the Fellow­ship by going to [Amazon.com](http://Amazon.com/) through the Fellowship's website. The Fellowship gets a fee from Amazon _ **every** _ _ **time** _ a purchase is made in this fashion.

The computer and the Internet are here to stay. It is a medium that at first, can seem intimidating but in the king run is well worth the time and effort to learn when considering the communication possibilities and vast array of information available. Another step in the direction of a united planet! +

**Study Groups**

**TEE PAPORTANCE OF STUDY GROUPS GN4•40T BE OVER-**

stated in our review of how The _ **Urantia Book** _ has _ **been,** _ and is being, disseminated. Among the most notable and tireless promoters of study groups was Julia Fenderson who traveled up and down the west coast, and to Australia and Fiji fostering the establishment of study groups. Peter Sarfaty's territory was the upper Mid­west, and likewise engaged in heroic study group activ­ity. Berkeley Elliott's warmly personal attention tostudy groups endeared her to each potential reader in the southwest.

A fuller discussion of how study groups work will be taking place in the months to come as the Domestic Extension Committee reevaluates its role in fostering study of the book.

The following article highlights the concern some­times expressed about how our study groups affect new­comers. It also implies that there must be found a middle ground between the overly intellectual approach and the satisfaction of spiritual needs of individuals. •
