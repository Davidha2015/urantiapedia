# Emilio Coppola, Avi Dogim, Steve Dreier 

_By Larry Bowman_ 

In the 65-year history of Urantia Brotherhood/ Urantia Book Fellowship, there probably has been only one time when General Council lost three of its members from death in a very short time span. That moment occurred from the tail end of 2019 to early April 2020, with the passing of Emilio Coppola, Avi Dogim, and Stephen Dreier. 

EMILIO COPPOLA DIED SUDDENLY on December 29 from surgery for an aortic tear. He was 55. A few weeks earlier, Emilio had resigned as Treasurer of The Urantia Book Fellowship, effective with the upcoming midwinter meeting in Austin, Texas. 

Emilio was elected to a vacancy on General Council in January 2008 and to a nine-year term in summer ’09, at which time he became Treasurer. He continued to serve in that position until his resignation. In 2010 he also became Treasurer of Urantia University, and for a number of years he also served as chair of the ad hoc IT Committee on the Fellowship. 

Emilio was a licensed financial professional and owned a firm that managed investments and consulted with companies on their financial options for funding their businesses. 

A resident of Virginia Beach, Virginia, Emilio is survived by his wife Melanie and three children. 

Following an Executive Committee meeting in Newark in fall 2012, Emilio played host of sorts to three fellow Executive Committee members as they attempted to do some sightseeing in Manhattan, just as Hurricane Sandy came to call. Along with Andrea Barnes, Tony Finstad, and Cristina Seaborn, the four tried to hold out in a Midtown 12th-floor hotel room. But when they learned that the bridges off the island were about to be closed, they realized they quickly had to leave New York City. Emilio drove everyone to his mother’s house in Westchester County, NY, where they stayed for another night or two. Catching flights back home for the three out-of-towners was now a problem, as the NYC airports were closed. Finally, Emilio graciously drove all three to Philadelphia, from where they caught flights back to their home states. 

Thanks to the absentmindedness of John Hales, who almost always called Emilio “Mario,” this name came to be his alternative ID. At a retreat during a General Council meeting near Los Angeles Airport in February 2013, Emilio/ Mario took advantage of his Italian-American heritage to share a story about his past that he said he was not proud of. During the retreat, each Councilor was to tell three stories, one of which was not true, and we were to guess which one was a lie. When it came Emilio’s turn, he went to elaborate precautions by making sure that no hotel staff were in the room to hear his story, and then to have the doors shut so that no one would come in while he was speaking. He then proceeded to tell his three stories. In one, he said he had been a male stripper. I don’t remember what another story was, but the one that took the longest to tell was so dramatic, I began to wonder if this was true. Emilio said that, as a young man, he was asked by family members to “take care of” someone who was a “problem” to the rest of them. In other words, at the family’s request, Emilio was forced to kill someone to get rid of him. 

As he told the story, I hoped and hoped that this was not a true story, but as he went on, he spoke so convincingly, I began to wonder if he had really done this. When he was through and it came time to reveal which story was a lie, he broke into a hearty laugh as he confessed that this rather preposterous story was indeed untrue. He won the award that evening for telling the big-gest lie. 

Emilio missed his calling as an actor. 

IN 1964, **AVI DOGIM** was at dockside in New York with his friend, Mark Sztejnberg, awaiting the arrival of Mark’s Russian- born cousin, Lila, who was coming from Poland, where she had lived for five years. When Avi caught sight of her coming down the gangplank, he commented, “Mark, you never told me you have such a pretty cousin!” It was love at first sight. 

Avi was born in 1946 in what was then Palestine, before the state of Israel was created. He was 14 when he came to the US. After he and Lila were married and began raising two daughters, he had an extensive career in vocational services for Jewish immigrants, while Lila became a doctor specializing in general medicine, geriatrics, and administration. A _New York Times_ article in June 1990 quoted Avi as saying that it was fairly easy to find clerical jobs for refugees, “but it’s tough to place engineers, computer programmers, scientists, and teachers.” 

In 1984 Avi became a member of the Fellowship’s Charter Committee (now Membership). He became chair four years later when he was elected to General Council and continued in that role until 1997, when he became Publications Chair. (I served on Charter during Avi’s last two years as chair.) In 2000 he was elected to the first of two three-year terms as President. He went off the Council in 2012, just as his wife became President. In January 2016 he was chosen to fill a vacancy on GC and remained a Councilor until his death this February, due to a recurrence of cancer. Avi and Lila lived in a high-rise condo in Cliffside Park, NJ, overlooking the Hudson River and, beyond, Manhattan’s Upper West Side. 

In spring 2008 Avi and Lila conducted a tour to Israel for Urantia Book readers. Several participants remember Avi’s brother and sister- in-law, who live in Israel, joining the others in Galilee and bringing along the best strawberries anyone had ever eaten. A niece (who is a UB reader), her husband, and their two children also showed up in a couple of places around the country. 

In 2012 Avi joined Chuck Burton and John Hales on a weeklong bike ride along Erie Canal from Buffalo to Albany. Lila also participated by driving her car and doing some sightseeing each day along the way. At night she and Avi would stay at B&Bs, while Chuck and John would pitch their tents at designated campgrounds—along with about 500 other bikers. Each morning Avi would ride along with the guys for a while and then would say, “Well, I’ve got to get some exercise.” And his wiry body would whirl off, leaving the others in the dust. Avi had been an avid bike rider for years. 

GOOGLE MAPS SHOWS that the distance from the Dogims’ condo tower to the one in Fort Lee, NJ, where Steve and Bobbie Dreier live, is just 1.2 miles. Knowing Barbara (her real name) as I do, she likely frequently walks that distance. **Steve Dreier** probably did not. I understand that their apartment looks out on George Washington Bridge. 

Bobbie taught grade school for 37 years. Steve was a chemistry professor and later chair of the chemistry department at New York City Technical College in Brooklyn. 

At the time of his passing, Steve had served on General Council for over 40 years. This, however, is not a record; John Hales is at least one person who has served much longer. Steve was first elected a Councilor in 1979 and immediately approved as a member of the Education Committee. In ’85 he became chair of the Charter Committee, to be succeeded three years later by Avi. Steve in turn became Judicial Chair. Steve became President in 1991 and served two terms. Afterwards he became Education Chair, but just a year later (1998) he became Vice President when Mo Siegel resigned to become a Trustee of Urantia Foundation. Steve served as Secretary to Avi’s two terms as President and then was off Executive Committee for a term before becoming Secretary again in 2009. He was still serving in that position when he “graduated.” 

Over the years Bobbie occasionally ran for General Council but was never elected until winter 2014, when she was chosen to fill a vacancy—along with youngster Geoffrey Theiss. It was satisfying to many fellow Councilors to see one with many years of experience in the movement chosen alongside an enthusiastic newcomer. In summer 2015 both her term and her husband’s were up, and they firmly said they were going off. But at the last minute, they both decided to run again and were each elected to nine-year terms. A year or so later, I overheard Steve tell others on EC that his term was for either three or six years—he couldn’t remember which. I told him he had been elected for nine years. He exclaimed, “Oh, hell, I’ll never live that long!” 

Sadly, that turned out to be true. On April 1 of this year he started throwing up, and the next day his son Marc, an ER doctor, took him by ambulance to the hospital. The following day he was diagnosed with Covid-19. He died the evening of April 5, with Marc holding his hand. He was 79. Steve told his son that night, “I'm going to take a little nap and when I wake up I'll either see you, or be somewhere else.” Bobbie was on the phone with Marc when Steve took his last breath. Marc later said, “Mom, I've seen a lot of people die, but I never saw anyone facing death as peacefully as Dad.” 

Among the many tributes to Steve was this one from Angie Thurston, who said, in part: “Steve taught me what it meant to be a cosmic citizen. I remember him sharing his aspiration to be an associate to a recording angel, and the steps he was taking in this life to prepare himself for that position. This had a lot to do with dependability, accuracy, and trustworthiness. ... I got to know Steve best when he mentored and supported me in chairing IC'14. In addition to sharing his wisdom, I got to see him take on the minutia of thankless logistical tasks so that I could focus on the bigger vision and practicing relational leadership. He did this on purpose so that I could learn. I, in turn, learned something about selfless service from him. I hope to pass on this kind of mentorship to someone someday.” Calling Steve one of the wisest people she had ever known, Angie concluded, “I look forward to learning from him in eternity, and seeing him take up his growing responsibilities in the vast school of the universe.” 

Steve was known for the many talks he gave over the years at conferences and retreats. Marc once asked him why he didn’t write his speeches, and Steve said he wanted to speak to the hearts of those who assembled, that he hoped to share personally what he understood and help bring them closer to God. The speech by Steve that I remember the most was one at a plenary at Summer Study Session at Lake Forest College sometime in the ‘90s. Steve used George Gershwin’s song, “Our Love is Here to Stay,” as his theme. In it he said that this was the last song that Gershwin ever wrote, as he was dying from a brain tumor. As I recall, Steve surmised that Gershwin knew he was about to die, so this was his farewell song. What I particularly remember is that Steve finished his speech by giving an a cappella rendition of the song and received a roaring response. His singing was not of the caliber of Francyl Gawryn, Barbara Hester, or Sally Annabella, but it was heartfelt. Last summer’s SSS at Techny Towers ended with a discussion about this very song and included a recording of Dinah Washington singing it. Afterwards I went up to Steve and commented on his speech of years earlier. He was pleased that I remembered it. 

ON THE COVER of this issue of Fellowship _Herald_ , Stephen Sawyer has created a drawing of Steve Dreier, Emilio Coppola, and Avi Dogim in a canoe. Steve Sawyer could not have known at the time that Steve and Bobbie Dreier took their first (and perhaps only) canoe trip in the summer of 1984 after the conference in Green Lake, Wisconsin. The accompanying photo of that adventure in Boundary Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota shows them along with three other former Presidents of the Brotherhood/ Fellowship: Paul Snider, John Hales, and David Elders. Of those three, only John is still living. Paul, David, and Steve have all died within the past year. Paddle on, gentlemen. 

# From the Supreme to the Three-person’d God: Seven Levels of Total Deity 


By Dave Holt How do we put it together in our minds that the absolute, unchanging God can also be a growing, evolving God, manifesting in new ways? In conversations with my Catholic cousin, he had a great deal of trouble unifying these seemingly contradictory ideas of Deity, not to say I didn’t. We can do it if we begin to accept the fundamental idea that not only life continues to evolve, but also God is evolving to meet the needs brought about by changes in the earth, the universe, and transformations initiated by human beings. That is why The Urantia Book (The UB) offers us its new vision, a revelation of a Supreme Being. “Action, completion of decisions, is essential to the evolutionary attainment of ... progressive kinship with ... the Supreme Being.” (pg. 1211; 110.6.17) 

Talking about God as The Supreme is not new. Asian religions have used the term in their sacred writings. When I was a yoga student, it was the first term for God that I learned from the Hindu tradition. "How universal is the Supreme—he is on all sides! The limitless things of creation depend on his presence for life, and none are refused." Those of us who are students of history know about Robespierre’s establishment of a Cult of the Supreme Being to replace Roman Catholicism during the French Revolution. 

The Supreme is perhaps the biggest upgrade to our language in The UB of the many that the authors attempted. It’s not just another name for God; it is classified as one of the Seven levels of Total Deity and, as The Supreme Being of the Sevenfold God, is the fourth step in our approach to the Paradise Trinity. 

Philosophers, thinkers and theologians have often tried to harmonize a god of “Being,” with a god still “Becoming.” The UB refers to the Static, Potential, Associative aspects of Deity, “This incomprehensible aspect of Deity may be static, potential, and associative but is not experientially creative or evolutional as concerns the intelligent personalities now functioning in the master universe.” (0:11.14) It is what Tillich and others described as “the Absolute ground of Being.” The god who is becoming, whose creative nature is still expanding, unfolding, growing, and developing is Associative, Creative, Evolutional, and becoming a personality, God the Supreme. 

In a class I attended years ago, workshop leader and teacher of The UB, David Glass, came up with the mnemonic device SPACE-SU (IT added to make it a word easy to memorize) to teach the Seven levels of Deity in the Foreword ( _The UB_ , 0:1.3, pg 2; Foreword.I.1- 4). I still regularly use it to help me remember them. 

- **Static:** “We may choose something like a star to stay our minds on and be staid.” (Robert Frost) 
- **Potential:** “The Tao ... is like the eternal void; filled with infinite possibilities. It is hidden but always present. I don’t know who gave birth to it. It is older than God.” (Tao Te Ching #4) 
- **Associative:** “That all of them may be one, Father, just as you are in me and I am in you. May they also be in us so that the world may believe that you have sent me. I have given them the glory that you gave me, that they may be one as we are one— I in them and you in me—so that they may be brought to complete unity. (John 17: 21-26) 
    “The universe is triune ... there is nothing that is not a unity of potentiality, actuality and connecting motion.” (Nicholas of Cusa, De Docta Ignorantia, circa 1450) 
- Creative: “Where there is creation there is progress. Where there is no creation, there is no progress.” (Chandogya Upanishad 7.16- 25, Trans. by Juan Mascaro) 
    “Create in me a pure heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me.” (Psalm 51) Evolutional: “God is a verb.” (Buckminster Fuller) Supreme: “Supreme reality ... is in process of dynamic growth between the unqualified potentials of outer space and the unqualified actuals at the center of all things.” (UB, pg. 1264; 115. sec 4) 
- Ultimate: “time-space-transcending Deity.” ( The UB , pg. 2) 

In paper 94:3.3 (The UB) we read about the advances made in Hindu religion: "Had the philosophers of those days been able to make this next advance in deity conception, had they been able to conceive of the Brahman as associative and creative, as a personality approachable by created and evolving beings, then might such a teaching have become the most advanced portraiture of Deity on Urantia since it would have encompassed the first five levels of total deity function and might possibly have envisioned the remaining two." 

The Supreme Being is also the fourth step in “our sevenfold approach to Deity,” (0:8.1) by which, “the finite attains the embrace of the infinite.” (0:8.11) 

Jesus’ teaching about the approachability to God (through the Supreme) is one that survived in Christianity. “Come to me, all you that are weary, and heavily burdened, and I will give you rest.” (Matthew 11:28) “Come near to God and he will come near to you.” (James 4:8) 

Michael Meade envisioned the reciprocal creation, our participation in the evolution of the Supreme through our own creative actions; he puts it this way, “The genius of human nature involves innate capacities for creation and invention that are important in the life of each individual and essential to the balance of the world. The true individual, by virtue of being himself or herself, enters a state of partnership with the ongoing acts of creation and thereby adds something to life that was not there before.” (Michael Meade, The Genius Myth, p. 14) 

We as artists, musicians, writers, and others who seek to reveal the Supreme through our creative work, or as parents, community leaders, organizers work to effect such a revelation in our actions; we are discovering more new pathways for doing God’s will. It’s a path to mutual love of God and humanity in conjoined action, a path to Joy. 


# Growing the Supreme 

By Michael Hill 

(From a presentation given a the 2018 UCNOW Gathering at Lake Wallowa by Michael Hill) For more information on the Urantian Communities Northwest see https://www.ucnow.net/ 

Relationships are the threads on the loom of time that weave the tapestry that is the Supreme. 


## Review of The Supreme 

1. 117:6.24 The Supreme Being is our deity – the Deity of evolutionary experiential perfection attainment. He is the culmination of the “exhaustion of all finite potentials” and “the attainment of perfected equilibrium throughout the universes” 
2. 22:7.11 The Supreme Being is the unification of three phases of deity reality: God the Supreme, the Almighty Supreme and Supreme Mind 
3. 0:9.2 “The Supreme is the Trinity unification comprehended by finite beings” 
4. 0:7.9 When finally actualized, this evolutionary Deity will constitute the eternal fusion of the finite and the infinite — the everlasting and indissoluble union of experiential power and spirit personality. 
5. 117:7.16 ...Certainly, though, the personality of the Supreme Being will be definitely contactable at some specific locality, although the ubiquity of his Deity presence will probably continue to permeate the universe of universes. 
6. Reality of the Supreme - 130:4. Causation in the physical world, self- consciousness in the intellectual world, and progressing selfhood in the spirit world — these realities, projected on a universal scale, combined in eternal relatedness, and experienced with perfection of quality and divinity of value — constitute the reality of the Supreme.” 

## Growing The Supreme – Relationship With God What We Need To Do 

1. 115:0.1 WITH God the Father, sonship is the great relationship. With God the Supreme, achievement is the prerequisite to status — one must do something as well as be something 
2. 116:1.1 The experience of every evolving creature personality is a phase of the experience of the Almighty Supreme. Our decision-actions either impede or further the actualization of the Supreme. 
3. 116:0.3 And such experiential growth implies creature-Creator partnership — God and man in association. 
    - a. And that partnership is represented in the adjuster and us 
        -i. We seek to know the will of God and partner with him in forming how we live our lives - this is our relationship intention with Deity 
    - b. 0:8.9 Additionally it is through God the Sevenfold that we mortals can attain the presence of God which begins with our recognition of the divinity of our Creator Son, Michael and our Divine Mother Spirit 
    - c. So there are two avenues for us to grow our relationship with God – with the adjuster and with our Creator Son, Michael who is the first rung on the ladder of God the Sevenfold as well as with our Divine Mother Spirit. 
    - d. 110:6.4 To grow our relationship with the Supreme, we need to have lives with a 
        - i. mind of perfect poise, 
        - ii. housed in a body of clean habits, 
        - iii. stabilized neural energies, 
        - iv. and balanced chemical function — 
        - v. for it is when the physical, mental, and spiritual powers are in triune harmony of development — that a maximum of light and truth can be imparted to us 
4. 100:1.5 And this forms the foundation for our religious growth. And we know that the behaviors essential for religious growth are 
    - a. progressive life of self-realization, 
    - b. the co-ordination of natural propensities, 
    - c. the exercise of curiosity and the enjoyment of reasonable adventure, 
    - d. the experiencing of feelings of satisfaction, 
    - e. the functioning of the fear stimulus of attention and awareness, 
    - f. the wonder-lure, and a normal consciousness of smallness, humility. 
    - g. Growth is also predicated on the discovery of selfhood accompanied by self- criticism — conscience, for conscience is really the criticism of oneself by one’s own value-habits, personal ideals. 
5. 100:1.8 We are also told of the religious habits of thinking and acting [which] are contributory to the economy of spiritual growth. And they are: 
    - i. cultivated sensitivity to divine values, 
    - ii. recognition of religious living in others, 
    - iii. reflective meditation on cosmic meanings, 
    - iv. worshipful problem solving, 
    - v. sharing one’s spiritual life with one’s fellows, 
    - vi. avoidance of selfishness, 
    - vii. refusal to presume on divine mercy, living as in the presence of God. 
6. And we know that our success in growing our relationship with God is the degree to which we manifest the fruits of the spirit in our lives. 
    - a. 117:6.17 The fruits of the spirit are the substance of the Supreme as he is realizable in human experience. 
7. And those fruits are:
    - a. 34:6.13 love, joy, peace, long- suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance
    - b. 193:2.2 loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace
    - c. 115:7.2 The Father’s plan for us has mandated
        - i. finite progress upon effort,
        - ii. creature achievement upon perseverance,
        - iii. and personality development upon faith. 
8. 110:6.17 Faith makes sonship with God real; action – completion of decisions – is required for consciousness of kinship with the Supreme Being, an essential component for circle attainment. 

## Growing The Supreme – Relationships With Others What We Can Do 

1. Michael in his bestowal as Jesus showed us all how to relate with others. 
2. It is how we are with others that either adds to or retards growth of the Supreme. 
    - a. It is in our relationships with others that we may show forth the fruits of the spirit. 
    - b. Our ability, choices and actions in expressing the fruits of the spirit is that measurement of our success at becoming God-like as mortals. 
    - c. And success in this effort defines our mortal divinity; in doing so we make will of God real 
3. It is our success at self-mastery and the keeping of spiritual habits that make up the soil for spiritual growth that aids us in shining forth the fruits of the spirit in our relationships with others which concomitantly nourishes the actualization of the Supreme. 

## Conclusion 

1. So what do we do to achieve this growth within ourselves, growth in our relationship to the Supreme and growth in improving our relationships with others? 
2. I believe that process begins with self- mastery. 
    - a. Jesus told the apostles, 143:2.3 Verily, verily, I say to you, he who rules his own self is greater than he who captures a city. Self- mastery is the measure of man’s moral nature and the indicator of his spiritual development. 
    - b. 28:6.13 And we are told that Trustworthiness is the true measure of self- mastery, [it is] character. 
3. 133:6.5 It is our soul that is the self- reflective, truth-discerning, and spirit- perceiving part of us 
4. 132:3.5 We are told that true faith is predicated on profound reflection, sincere self- criticism, and uncompromising moral consciousness 
    - a. We can each grow our side of our relationship with God as we practice reflection, self-evaluation and sustained moral consciousness. Our achievement of these efforts grows the Supreme and conditions the growth of our relationships – human and divine. 


# Adoration of the Mother 


_By Bro. Joshua Wilson. Edited by Elianne Obadia_ 

EVERYONE has a birth mother. And, to foster greater love within the family circle, much can be gained from discovering and knowing the _divine feminine_. 

The truth of motherhood begins all the way from the Trinity in Paradise, and continues to God the Mother, the Supreme Being. [117:6.8] " _All soul- evolving humans are literally the evolutionary sons of God the Father and God the Mother, the Supreme Being._ " This truth is further revealed in the person of our Universe Mother residing at the center of our local universe, and extends to us creatures—parental procreators— and then on to more children. 

Let us think of the person of our Universe Mother as our focal point. She is our near and divine mother who we can, and do, contact on a continual basis, because of the presence of her Holy Spirit on earth. She is ever present with us, and _to be adored_. 

The Greeks had a figure of speech, “The material is the shadow of the more real spirit substance.” I submit to you that the reason our families have fathers and mothers as parents is not mere biological happenstance or unrelated coincidence. The reason lies in the fact that _this is the way it is above_ , in our universe capital where resides Christ our Father, and our Mother, the Creative Spirit. Her Holy Spirit is a personal revelation to us, helping us to understand more clearly who she is and who Christ is. The day has dawned for us to be freed to _Adoration of the Mother_ —to see her and know her, and love her as she is. 

## Views of The Trinity 

Many religions contain trinity concepts, and a clear one is seen in Christianity. Yet some parts of Christendom have been slow to recognize the divine feminine. We hear of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Playing one day with a young child, I assembled several dolls and figurines in a pile on the floor. On a piece of paper I drew three circles. I placed a father on one circle, a baby on the middle, and pointing to the open circle said, “What goes on this circle?” She looked over the group of dolls, animals, and objects, and picked up a woman and placed her on the remaining circle. “A little child shall lead us.” This is a simple and clear picture of the trinity of God. 

And so, it doesn’t require an astute theology to plumb the mystery. The hang up has been, in simplest terms, a dominant cultural orientation slow to honor and recognize women on many levels. Fortunately, we have her spirit with us and wonderful examples all around, clarifying the picture for us.

## Mother Mary

In Catholicism a doctrine was codified by Pope Pius XII (Eugenio Pacelli) in 1950, called the Assumption of Mary. It promulgates the idea that Mary, the mother of Jesus was translated to heaven, without seeing death. It is known that a number of persons, such as Enoch and Elijah, and even people in the current era have been so translated from earth without seeing natural death. Interestingly, there is no verified history, tradition, or record of Mary’s death and burial. I do not have personal knowledge about whether she was translated or not. Yet, when I visit a Catholic or Orthodox church and observe the statues and icons of Mary, some of them quite artistic and beautiful, I enjoy taking some moments spending time contemplating our Universe Mother. Before any hasten to criticize such adoration, let me suggest that such religious practices, though perhaps incomplete, at the same time show an important evolutionary step toward recognition of the Divine Mother. There have been many such theological-evolutionary steps throughout history. 

It should be noted that psychologist Dr. Carl Jung (contemporary of Dr. William Sadler), through his archetype of The Great Mother, viewed this recognition in 1950 as a significant, even monumental development in the human psyche moving toward recognition of the _divine feminine_. 

image  Krisna and Radha

## Radha in Hinduism 

Readers of the revelation have speculated over the years that there could be a connection between the Hindu avatar Krishna and his wife Radha —and the historical Adamson and his wife Ratta. Adamson, the first son of Adam and Eve, was a pure-line violet race progeny (and Krishna is usually portrayed in paintings with blue skin color.) Ratta was the last of the pure- line offspring of the Prince’s staff from Jerusem. What a pair Adamson and Ratta must have been! 

The adoration in India and elsewhere of Radha, and also of Shakti Ma (part of the trinity pantheon with Shiva and Vishnu) shows the idealization of the mother in a large and ancient population. 

There are such examples to be found in every culture, including Danu (the Irish-Celtic goddess mother), El Shaddai and Shekinah (Hebrew feminine concepts of deity), Eve (first mother in many traditions), and Gaia (revived modern pantheistic goddess.) Christian Scientists often refer to God as “Father-Mother God.” The LDS or Mormon church teaches that all human beings are beloved spirit children of the Heavenly Father and the Mother in Heaven. 

## A Dystopian View Without Mother

In an opening scene from the science fiction film-noir movie _Blade Runner_ (Warner Bros., 1982), a “replicant” named Leon (played by Brion James), a near-perfect human-appearing android, is tested by his employer using a machine that magnifies and observes slight changes in the iris of the eye. Leon is asked questions to evoke emotional responses. When Leon is asked about his mother, he becomes enraged and violent. Perhaps the scene contains a message that the mother-child relationship is essentially what makes us human. 

## Mother-Love

A challenge some new believers encounter has to do with calling God “father.” Some of us grew up in loving homes enveloped in fairness, kindness and forgiveness, others to lesser degrees. In our culture individuals deal with the feelings they have about their birth mothers or the mothers who raised them—and just how to carry these experiences forward into their maturing lives. These feelings in some cases help them to recognize the presence of the divine Mother, and in others hinder. 

Fortunately, the religious experience is a transformative one, and transcendent. The way to knowing and loving our divine parents is fully open to all, equally, regardless of our upbringing or heredity. 

## Our Mother Who Is In Heaven 

We are so very lovingly cared for and watched over by our Mother. “Mother, we adore you.” Having covered some preliminary insights, let us now think about the wonderful realities of her ministry to each of us, as disclosed by the revelation of the Urantia papers: 

- The Mother Spirit of Salvington knows you fully, for her Holy Spirit on our world “searches all things.” [UB 28:5.22] It is comforting to know that if any personality in all the wide universes desires or has reason to know about us, such knowledge must be gained from the Mother. _She protects us_. 
- The Universe Mother Spirit never leaves the local universe headquarters world. [34:4.7] _She is always home_. 
- Christ’s Spirit of Truth works as one with the presence of the spirit of the Mother. "This dual spirit liaison hovers over the world, seeking to teach truth and to spiritually enlighten your mind, to inspire your soul, and to lead you ever towards the Paradise goal of divine destiny." [34:5.4] _Mom and Dad work together._ 
- "The Holy Spirit is partly independent of your human attitude—and partially conditioned by the decisions and co- operation of your will. The ministry of the Holy Spirit becomes increasingly effective in sanctifying and spiritualizing your inner life as you more fully obey the divine leadings." [34:5.5] _Do what Mom says._ 
- "The Holy Spirit of the Mother ministers to your conscious realization of the faith-fact of your sonship with God." [34:5.7] _You are her child._ 
- We need truth “Not in word only but also in power and in the Holy Spirit.” "The seed of theoretical truth is dead, the highest moral concepts without effect, unless and until the divine Spirit breathes upon the forms of truth and quickens the formulas of righteousness." [34:6.6] _She is powerful._ 
- The spirit domination of your human life is increasingly attended by the characteristics of the Spirit in your life, “for the fruits of the spirit are love, joy, peace, long-suffering, gentleness, goodness, faith, meekness, and temperance.” [34:6.13] _She brings fruitfulness._
- "The Holy Spirit is your initial supermind bestowal. This ministry to your worship-craving and wisdom-desiring mind creates the capacity to realize the idea of human survival beyond this life." [92:0.4] _She is forever._ 
- Spiritual reason and soul intelligence is the endowment of the Holy Spirit, the Creative Spirit’s gift to you. [101:3.2] _She shares all with her children._ 

## It Takes A Family To Raise A Child

Let me speak clearly about our spiritual connections. The Thought Adjuster is very real, a pure spirit, and therefore somewhat remote to our almost wholly material minds at this time. On the other hand, the influence of Christ (who proceeds from the Universal Father and the Eternal Son) is unmistakable, and the presence of his partner, the Universe Mother (who proceeds from the Infinite Spirit) are very approachable and able to be experienced, personally known, loved, and adored. _She is adorable._ 

Christ, our Father, who visited as Jesus of Nazareth, and our Universe Mother are our true parents, our divine co-creators. Our universe is governed by dual supervision. Christ and Mother are marriage partners in the real, not allegorical, sense: they together literally designed and built their universe home, and bore many children and high personalities of the universe. They oversee our education, and are planning for our future. Just as children growing up need the influence of both a father and a mother, so we need the saving watchcare of both—Father Michael and Divine Mother. 

## To Love, Adore, Exalt, Honor

We hear and talk about the terms: worship, prayer, and meditation, and they are intrinsic parts of our lives. Importantly, we know that throughout the universes it is taught that worship is to be accorded only to our Universal Father in Paradise. But what about our heart-felt affections for Michael and Mother? _Adoration_ is the word. To “exalt, honor, and cherish” are other appropriate words. “Honor your father and mother.” 

image Coronation by Giotto di Bondone 

At this point in my upward, inward journey, Michael and Mother are becoming closer, more approachable, and more real to me day by day. Now when I read encouragements to “love God,” or to “love God with all your heart and mind and soul and strength” I’m more likely to immediately think of Michael and Mother, creator Father and creative Mother of our universe. [174:4.2] Perhaps its because each passing day I’m farther along in my journey to meet them face to face, and I look forward to it greatly. 

Our earthly mothers raised us and helped us leave the nest like little eaglets. At some point our local Universe Mother will hand us off to God the Mother, the Supreme, as we graduate to our superuniverse career. And then at a further point, the Supreme will send us on to discover the Eternal Mother on Paradise. 

I don’t remember my earthly father exactly telling me to love my mother, but he did tell me to do what she said, and the unspoken command was clearly “become what she hopes for you, and all you can be.” It has been natural for me to love my mother. I do read in the Revelation, regarding the Divine Mother, to “obey her leadings.” [34:5.5] That is the way of love. And I read of the exquisite, divine love and mutual cooperation between our Creator Father and Mother, which is surely my best example and inspiration. Jesus said, 

> “ **_The Father in heaven treats the Spirit Mother of the children of the universe as one equal to himself._** _It is Godlike to share your life and all that relates to it on equal terms with the mother partner who so fully shares with you that divine experience of reproducing yourselves in the lives of your children. If you can only love your children as God loves you, you will love and_ **_cherish your wife as the Father in heaven honors and exalts the Infinite Spirit, the mother_** _of all the spirit children of a vast universe.”_ (The Urantia Book, 133:2.2) 

Also, my earthly mother doesn’t need to say, “Love me,” but she did ask me to call more often, and she loved it when I came to visit. 

Maybe to love our divine Mother means just that... to call her up, frequently, and to follow, obey her perfect leadings. Still, I like to just say, “Mom, I love you.” 

## You Are Exalted (Hymn) 

> You are exalted, forever exalted on high, 
> I will praise you. 
> You are exalted, forever exalted and I will praise your name—Michael. 
> You are the Lord, forever you reign on high. 
> Heaven and earth rejoice in your holy name, You are exalted, forever exalted on high. 
> You are exalted, forever exalted on high, 
> I will praise you. 
> You are exalted, forever exalted and I will praise your name—Mother. 
> You are the One, forever you reign on high. 
> Heaven and earth rejoice in your holy name, 
> You are exalted, forever exalted on high.

## A Visualization

Picture, if you will, a great stream of power and loving spirit extending from Paradise, through Havona, and focalizing on the capital of our local universe of Nebadon. Then picture another stream continuing from that universe capital and opening to the creations of time and space in which we live, move and have our being. Here is another way to picture this from the center, moving outward: 
- a. The Eternal Mother, Source and Center in Paradise 
- b. God the Mother, the Supreme Being residing in Havona and overseeing the evolving grand universe—our experiential mother 
- c. The Divine Minister, the Universe Mother Spirit, Christ Michael’s consort, without whom we could not so much as breathe a breath, think a thought, or take a step, who has given us her Holy Spirit 
- d. Our own birth mothers, grandmothers, great grandmothers, and cultural mothers on earth to whom we owe our beginning life.

People are prone to start from what is “at hand” and work backwards to origins. But this is not the way of wisdom. We must start from the core (inside) and work our way outward. 

Do not each of us carry inheritance traits of both our biological mother and father? Are not fathers sometimes called upon by necessity to fulfill the role of mother, and vice versa? 

The Trinity Inevitability. Universe philosophers have stated there are multiple, many, perhaps even infinite ways that all things can or could be done. But, there is only one absolute inevitability—the Trinity. [10:0.3] All that we know or attempt to imagine could not be done but through the Trinity—the Father, the Mother, and their Conjoint Action.

# TODAY is the day for JOY! 

By David Glass 

All of these truths shall be valid for any day that is TODAY exploring the divine love of God! 

> This is the day the Lord has made; 
> Let us rejoice and be glad in it. 
> 
> [Psalm 118](/en/Bible/Psalms/118): 

> Serve the Lord with gladness; 
> Come before his presence with singing. 
> Know that the Lord is God; 
> It is he that has made us 
> And not we ourselves. 
> Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, 
> And into his courts with praise. 
> Be thankful unto him 
> And bless his name; 
> For the Lord is good, 
> His mercy is everlasting, 
> And his truth endures to all generations. 
> 
> [Psalm 100](/en/Bible/Psalms/100) 

There is inherent joy in freewill existence. [28:5.16] (312.3) 

We get a peculiar satisfaction out of the assurance “that all things work together for good”—for spirits and celestials as well as for mortals. This confidence grows out of our faith in the loving overcare of our universe superiors and in the divine stability of the supreme directors. [48:4.7] (548.2) 

Said Jesus: “Future generations shall know the radiance of our joy, the buoyancy of our goodwill, and the inspiration of our good humor. We proclaim a message of good news which is infectious in its transforming power. Our religion is throbbing with new life and new meanings. Those who accept this teaching are filled with joy and in their hearts are constrained to rejoice evermore. Increasing happiness is always the experience of all who are certain about God. [159:3.10] (1766.6) 

_The Joys of Existence._ The principal activities of this group of superuniverse seconaphim are directed toward promoting reactions of joy among the various orders of the angelic hosts and the lower will creatures. In a more general manner, they function as joy clearinghouses, seeking to up step the pleasure reactions of the realms while trying to improve the humor taste, to develop a superhumor among mortals and angels. They endeavor to demonstrate that _there is inherent joy in freewill existence_ , independent of all extraneous influences. [28:5.16] (3112.3)

Wrote Ganid: This new religion of ours is very full of joy, and it generates an enduring happiness. The loving service of the children of God enlarges our capacity to receive and experience the joys of heaven. [131:10.5-6] (1454.2-3)

image Detail from "The lighthouse at Alexandria" by Slawa Radziszewska 

Consider the life of joyous faith that Jesus attained and lived and whereby he was able to reveal the loving nature of the heavenly Father: 

Jesus experienced the tranquility of supreme and unquestioning trust in God and felt the tremendous thrill of living, by faith, in the very presence of the heavenly Father. He calmly stood in the divine presence free from fear and fully conscious of spiritual invincibility. 

In the Master’s life, we discover a new and higher type of religion based on personal relations with the Universal Father and validated by the supreme authority of genuine personal experience. In the human life of Jesus faith was personal, living, original, spontaneous, and purely spiritual. 

The secret of his unparalleled religious life was this consciousness of the presence of God and he attained it by intelligent prayer and sincere worship—unbroken communion with God. Said Jesus: “It is not so important that you should know about the fact of God as that you should increasingly grow in the ability to _feel the presence of God_ .” 

The Master desires that all his followers should fully share his transcendent faith. Jesus brought to God, as a man of the realm, the greatest of all offerings: the consecration and dedication of his own will to the majestic service of doing the divine will. Jesus desires his disciples to believe with him in the reality of the love of God and in full confidence accept the security of the assurance of sonship with the heavenly Father. [196:0] (2087-2089) & [155:6.12] (1733.1) 

The Father desires all his creatures to be in personal communion with him. There is an infinite grandeur and an inexpressible generosity connected with the majesty of his love which causes him to yearn for the association of every created being who can comprehend, love, or approach him. 

Settle in your philosophy now and forever: to each of you, God is approachable, the Father is attainable, the way is open; the forces of divine love and the ways and means of divine administration are all interlocked in an effort to facilitate the advancement of every worthy intelligence of every universe to the Paradise presence of the Universal Father. 

Although the approach to the Paradise presence of the Father must await your attainment of the highest finite levels of spirit progression, you should rejoice in the recognition of the ever-present possibility of immediate communion with the bestowal spirit of the Father so intimately associated with your inner soul and your spiritualizing self. Said Jesus: “Every honest attempt of the material mind to communicate with its indwelling spirit meets with certain success.” [5:1.2-3,8] ([62.4]- [63.1,6]) & [133:4.10] (1475.4) 

The greatest evidence of the goodness of God and the supreme reason for loving him is the indwelling gift of the Father—the Adjuster who so patiently awaits the hour when you both shall be eternally made one. That fragment of the pure Deity of the Universal Father which indwells mortal man is a part of the infinity of the First Great Source and Center, the Father of Fathers. 

The great God makes direct contact with mortal man and gives a part of his infinite and eternal and incomprehensible self to dwell within him. God has embarked upon the eternal adventure with man. If you yield to the leadings of the spiritual forces in you and around you, you cannot fail to attain the high destiny established by a loving God as the universe goal of his ascendant creatures from the evolutionary world of space. [2:1.11] (35.4) & [5:1.12] (64.3) & [2:5.5] (39.4)

The love of the Father appears in the mortal personality by the ministry of the indwelling Adjuster. All true love is from God, and man receives the divine affection as he himself bestows this love upon his fellows. Man can never take the love of God and imprison it within his heart. The Father’s love can become real to mortal man only by passing through that man’s personality as he in turn bestows this love upon his fellows. Such a God-knowing son reveals this love to his universe brethren, and this fraternal affection is the essence of the love of the Supreme. 

The great circuit of love is from the Father, through sons to brothers, and hence to the Supreme. The search for God is the unstinted bestowal of love attended by amazing discoveries of new and greater love bestowed. Men all too often forget that God is the greatest experience in human existence. Other experiences are limited in their nature and content, but the experience of God has no limits save those of the creature’s comprehension capacity, and this very experience is in itself capacity enlarging. When men search for God, they are searching for everything. When they find God, they have found everything. [117:6.9-10] (1298.2-3)

At times I am almost pained to be compelled to portray the divine affection of the heavenly Father for his universe children by the employment of the human word symbol love. How unfortunate that I cannot make use of some supernal and exclusive term which would convey to the mind of man the true nature and exquisitely beautiful significance of the divine affection of the Paradise Father! [2:5.11] (40.3) 

Mortal man cannot possibly know the infinitude of the heavenly Father. But this same finite human being can actually feel —literally experience—the full and undiminished impact of such and infinite Father’s LOVE. Finite appreciation of infinite qualities far transcends the logically limited capacities of the creature because of the fact that mortal man is made in the image of God—there lives within him a fragment of infinity. Therefore, man’s nearest and dearest approach to God is by and through love, for God is love. [3:4.6-7] (50.4-5)

To finite man truth, beauty, and goodness embrace the full revelation of divinity reality. As this _love-comprehension of Deity_ finds spiritual expression in the lives of God-knowing mortals, there are yielded the fruits of the divine spirit: intellectual peace, social progress, moral satisfaction, spiritual joy, and cosmic wisdom. The advanced mortals on a world in the seventh stage of light and life have learned that love is the greatest thing in the universe, and they know that God is love. Love is the desire to do good to others. [56:10.20-21] (648.2-3) (my emphasis) 

The divine personality is defined as consisting in spirit and manifesting himself to the universe as love. Therefore, in all his personal relations with the creature personalities of the universes, the First Source and Center is always and consistently a loving father. God’s only personal attitude towards the affairs of the universe is always a reaction of divine affection. The infinite love of God is not secondary to anything in the divine nature. He is eternally motivated by the perfect idealism of divine love, and that nature finds its strongest expression and in loving and being loved. [188:4.8] (2017.2) & [4:4.6] (59.2) 

Said Jesus: Love is the greatest of all spirit realities. I declare to you that my Father in Paradise does rule a universe of universes by the compelling power of his love. Love is the supreme relationship. God the Father divinely loves his children, all of them. [134:4.1] (1486.4) 

God loves every individual; he is no respecter of persons; yet God thus loves each individual as an individual child in the heavenly family. The love of the Father absolutely individualizes each personality of the Universal Father. The Father’s love glorifies each child of God, illuminating each member of the celestial family. The love of God strikingly portrays the transcendent value of each will creature, unmistakably reveals the high value which the Universal Father has placed upon each and every one of his children. [12:7.8-9] (138.3-4) (my emphasis) 

There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. [32:5.7] (365.3) 

image here

We all love the Universal Father and all other beings, divine or human, because we discern that these personalities truly love us. The experience of love is very much a direct response to the experience of being loved. [2:5.8] (39.7) 

As you ponder the loving nature of God, there is only one reasonable, natural personality reaction thereto: You will increasingly love your Maker; you will yield to God an affection analogous to that given by a child to an earthly parent; for as a father, a real father, a true father, loves his children so the Universal Father loves and forever seeks the welfare of his created sons and daughters. [2:5.9] (40.1)

The affectionate dedication of the human will to the doing of the Father’s will is man’s choicest gift to God; in fact, such a consecration of a creature will constitute man’s only possible gift of true value to the Paradise Father. There is nothing which man can give to God except this choosing to abide by the Father’s will, and such decisions, affected by the intelligent will creatures of the universe, constitute the reality of that true worship which is so satisfying to the love-dominated nature of the Creator Father. [1:1.2] (22.5)

God first loves man and confers upon him the potential of immortality—eternal reality. And as man loves God, so does man become eternal in actuality. And here is a mystery: The more closely man approaches God through love, the greater the reality—actuality—of that man. When man consecrates his will to the doing of the Father’s will, when man gives God all that he has, then does God make that man more than he is. [117:4.14] (1285.3)

Sooner or later all universe personalities begin to realize that the final quest of eternity is the endless exploration of infinity, the neverending voyage of discovery into the absoluteness of the First Source and Center. We arrive at the understanding that living the will of God is the eternal passport to the endless possibility of infinity itself. To material evolutionary, finite creatures, a life predicated on the living of the Father’s will leads directly to the attainment of spiritual supremacy in the personality arena and brings such creatures one step nearer the comprehension of the Father-Infinite. 

Such a Father life is one predicated on truth, sensitive to beauty, and dominated by goodness. Such a God-knowing person is inwardly illuminated by worship and outwardly devoted to the wholehearted service of the universal brotherhood of all personalities, a service ministry which is filled with mercy and motivated by love. [106:9.11-12] (1174.7-1175.1) Said Jesus: “If you would but believe that my Father loves you with an infinite love, then you are in the kingdom of God.” [137.8.17] (1537.5) 

The Father’s love follows us now and throughout the endless circle of the eternal ages. [2:5.9 ]


# Uversa

The future Headquarters of the Supreme Being

_By Tom Allen_ 

The Urantia papers reveal that each of the seven superuniverses has a major purpose in the expression of its totality. The major purpose of tardy Orvonton is the bestowal of lavish mercy upon us all. [15:14.2-3] Because this bountiful conferral of love and mercy encompasses the “meaning-of-the-whole,” God the Supreme is likely, in the distant future, to wield Her completed personal and sovereign Almighty power as the Supreme Being from Uversa. This makes Uversa a very special place in the grand universe. 

The Urantia papers give rise to a credible hypothesis about the location of Uversa when coupled with current astronomy and historic considerations. Recent research on the distant globular cluster NGC 2419 reveals certain possibilities that the “Intergalactic Wanderer” is the greater system wherein Uversa is located in the constellation Lynx. 

Because it seemed so distant, Harlow Shapley in 1922 called NGC 2419 the “Intergalactic Tramp,” meaning that it seemed to be tramping across the universe with no connection to the Milky Way. It is now commonly nicknamed the “Intergalactic Wanderer” to clarify what Shapley meant. 

image here NGC 2419 ESA/Hubble 

In order to justify the hypothesis that NGC 2419 is the location of Uversa, here are pertinent historical and current facts used to find a universe framework for comparative analysis and synthesis with the Urantia papers: 
- It was discovered by William Herschel on December 31, 1788. 
- It is estimated to contain a million stars across a spatial diameter of 400 light-years. 
- NGC 2419 is in the direction very near the galactic anticenter toward Lynx. This line begins at the center of the Milky Way and goes through Urantia (and Jerusem) and follows this particular direction through the dense diameter of the Milky Way toward Lynx. 
- It is one of the brightest, largest, and most distant globular clusters surrounding the Milky Way. 
- Harlow Shapley estimated the distance to NGC 2419 in 1922 at 168,000 light-years.[^1] 
- Walter Baade estimated the distance in 1935 at 185,000 light-years.[^2] 
- The radial velocity is 20 km/sec in our direction.[^3]
- It takes three billion years for NGC 2419 elliptically to rotate once over the pole of the Milky Way.[^4]
- NGC 2419 contains two separate populations of red giant stars, one of which is unusually helium-rich. These stars are rotating predominantly in the center of NGC 2419.[^5] 
- The present distance estimate from Urantia to NGC 2419 is approximately 270,000 light-years. 
- The furthest distance in the rotation of NGC 2419 around the Milky Way from Urantia is 319,000 light-years. 
- The closest approach of NGC 2419 to Urantia is 172,000 light-years. 
- The average distance of NGC 2419 from Urantia is 245,000 light-years.

The following four quotes are all the references in the Urantia papers about the location of Uversa. Each quote is followed with analysis about how NGC 2419 correlates with evidence concerning the location of Uversa. 

> 1. The Sagittarius sector and all other sectors and divisions of Orvonton are in <ins>rotation around Uversa</ins>, and some of the confusion of Urantian star observers arises out of the illusions and relative distortions produced by the following multiple revolutionary movements: [15:3.7]
> 
> 6. The <ins>whirl</ins> of the ten major sectors, the so-called star drifts, <ins>about</ins> the Uversa headquarters of Orvonton. [15:3.13]

Analysis of English usage is critical to decipher what the revelators mean when describing cosmology. As a noun in Webster’s 1934 dictionary, “whirl” means rapid rotation, gyration, or circumvolution. In complicated English, the word “about” can be used as a prepositional phrase functioning as an adverb. This means that “about” translates to “in or somewhat near.” Example: I ride my bicycle** _about_ my neighborhood. This is the same way “about” is used in [15:3.13]. All ten major sectors within the Milky Way are in rotation “around” Uversa. “Around” is also used as a preposition and is defined in its second definition from Webster’s 1934 dictionary as, “Here and there in the vicinity of, so as to lie on every side; also, into proximity of or toward, from all directions; as the trees _around_ his grave.” This may be the way the Universal Censor meant to define “around.” Major sectors rotate _around_ Uversa and NGC 2419. 

It is clear that the Milky Way is in rotation.[^6] This rotation is the Milky Way “whirl” along with the whirl of the ten major sectors within the Milky Way. NGC 2419 orbits over the pole of the Milky Way every three billion years. Thus, the Milky Way and the ten major sectors all whirl around multiple times for each polar rotation of NGC 2419. This hypothetically means that these ten Orvonton major sector so- called star drifts rotate and “whirl” “around” and “about” Uversa — NGC 2419.

> 2. While each superuniverse government presides <ins>near the center</ins> of the evolutionary universes of its space <ins>segment</ins>,... While <ins>sharing the light of near-by suns</ins>,... These headquarters worlds belong to <ins>one</ins> of the <ins>greater systems situated near the astronomical center of their respective superuniverses</ins>. [15:7.1]

Barycenter is an astronomical term to denote the specific location of the common center of mass around which two or more bodies revolve. For example, the barycenter of the Milky Way is situated in an immense black hole or a massive dark island of space estimated to be the mass of four million suns named Sagittarius A*. (Sag A*) Another example is that the barycenter of Monmatia (our solar system) is centered in our sun.

Uversa is over 200,000 light-years from Jerusem, and is “near” or close to the astronomical center of the seventh superuniverse space segment. If NGC 2419 is being identified as the astronomical center because of its power control, then NGC 2419 being near the center, could itself be the barycenter of the entire space segment of the seventh superuniverse. However, the physical or astronomical barycenter could be somewhere else nearby, such as the center of the Milky Way or another undisclosed nearby location. Uversa is still “near” wherever is located the barycenter of “its space segment.” This seventh space segment possibly involves many more uninhabited galaxies from the local group, the local sheet, or the local volume along with the partially and solely inhabited Milky Way. Speculatively, they will all architecturally conjoin with the evolving Milky Way in possibly trillions of Urantia years. That is possibly how long we must wait for the completion of Supremacy. 

Regardless of what the revelators meant by the true physical and astronomic center of the seventh superuniverse, it is non-consequential to the theory that NGC 2419 is the location of Uversa. 

NGC 2419 is clearly “one of the greater systems” surrounding the Milky Way. NGC 2419 can provide many nearby suns for Uversa. If Uversa is located on the periphery of NGC 2419 and if it is being referred to as the astronomical center, then Uversa would be near to that center and free from the unwanted influence of gigantic living or dead suns. 

> 3. Uversa is favorably situated for the work of this colony, not only because of its central location, but also because there are no gigantic living or dead suns near at hand to disturb the energy currents. [30:3.2]

Uversa within NGC 2419 has a central location near the astronomical center of the entire seventh superuniverse space segment. Uversa is the nucleus of electronic power regulation for the entire space segment of Orvonton. Two populations of rotating red giant stars rotate around the center of NGC 2419, so Uversa with its central location could have been constructed outside of the center of NGC 2419. Uversa could be situated in the periphery of the cluster in a central location of its space segment. It could easily share the light with near-by suns. 

> 4. The Satania system of inhabited worlds is <ins>far removed from Uversa and that great sun cluster</ins> which functions as the <ins>physical or astronomic center</ins> of the seventh superuniverse. <ins>From Jerusem</ins>, the headquarters of Satania, it is <ins>over two hundred thousand light-years</ins> to the <ins>physical center</ins> of the superuniverse of Orvonton, far, far away <ins>in the dense diameter of the Milky Way</ins>. Satania is on the periphery of the local universe, and <ins>Nebadon</ins> is now well out towards the edge of Orvonton. From the <ins>outermost system</ins> of inhabited worlds to the <ins>center of the superuniverse</ins> is a <ins>trifle less than two hundred and fifty thousand light- years</ins>. (32:2.11)


image  The anticenter through Urantia from the galactic center is in the direction through “the dense diameter” of the Milky Way plane, toward the constellation Lynx, which is the location of NGC 2419. 

In this quote, Uversa seems to be identified as “the physical and astronomic center of the seventh superuniverse.” From this astronomical center, power is regulated by one thousand power centers of the third order. [15:8.1-2] [29:2.13-15] Immense electronic power is partially controlled from Uversa and bathes the entire seventh space segment. This is what possibly makes Uversa “the physical and astronomic center of the seventh superuniverse.” In this quote, the barycenter is not being identified, although arguments can be made that Uversa is “near” the ambiguous barycenter.** 

It is likely that our superuniverse is gravitationally barycentric at some unrevealed place in the vast space segment of Orvonton. Identification of the physical and astronomic barycenter of Orvonton is a worthy study not relevant to the hypothetical conclusion that NGC 2419 is the location of Uversa, and near to whichever center is being postulated. 

“In” is a common astronomic term that indicates direction. “<ins>In</ins> the dense diameter of the Milky Way” refers to the direction through the density of the flat plane of the Milky Way. There are conceptually an infinite number of dense diameters within the Milky Way. This particular anticenter direction is a line through the dense diameter from the galactic center toward nearby Lynx and NGC 2419. The Milky Way is quite dense in this direction as opposed to a direction above or below the Milky Way. 

The “outermost system” is probably in Nebadon because the prior sentence references Nebadon. Thus, the outermost system in Nebadon is a trifle less than 250,000 light-years from Uversa. The average distance of NGC 2419 from Jerusem is approximately 245,000 light-years. A comparison of the average distance of a nearby and outermost Nebadon system to the average distance of Jerusem to Uversa, puts these two systems only a few thousand light-years apart. This could be true if the revelators plausibly meant to average the distances of these two Nebadon systems from Uversa. 

In conclusion of this hypothesis, these following data and speculations give strong evidence to justify the conclusion that NGC 2419 is possibly the location of Uversa. This theory is based on the concept that “over two hundred thousand light-years” is literal and not an analogy. 
- Uversa is located “in the dense diameter” which means that it is in the direction of the anticenter through Urantia which is through the medium of the density of the Milky Way toward Lynx and NGC 2419. The distance from Urantia to Jerusem does not significantly change this direction. 
- “That great sun cluster” NGC 2419 is posited to be either the barycenter of the seventh space segment, the astronomical center of power control, or both. Any interpretation of the location of “the physical and astronomic center” is compatible with NGC 2419 as the home of Uversa. 
- 245,000 light years is the average distance from Urantia to Uversa. This is consistent with the revealed distance to Uversa from Jerusem which is over 200,000 light-years. One plausible reason the revelators could not reveal the actual distance to NGC 2419 by 1934, is because Shapley and Baade measured it at less than 200,000 light-years. Knowing that modern science would eventually discover a truer distance to NGC 2419, the only clue the revelators were willing to give was that its distance is over 200,000 light-years. 
- A trifle less than 250,000 light-years is the average distance of the “outermost system” in Nebadon to Uversa. Satania’s average distance from NGC 2419 of 245,000 light-years could be just a few thousand light-years apart from this furthest away Nebadon outermost system. 

The ten major sector Milky Way so-called star drifts whirl elliptically around and about the three billion light-year orbit of NGC 2419 over, and around the Milky Way.

I am eager to see if others can come up with a better location for Uversa. Feel free to discourse with me at tommykaren1@gmail.com. It seems that the revelators expected us to find the location of Uversa with these vague clues about its whereabouts. 

In the meantime, let us enjoy all the love and mercy lavishly bestowed upon us and spread this beneficence to all, as we progress in the glory of our universe ascent as sons and daughters of a living and loving Father God and a Supreme Mother. [117:6.2]

When the grand universe is in light and life, the maximum finite completion of our divine Mother — the Supreme Being — will likely reign in loving power-personality synthesis from Uversa. NGC 2419 could very well eventually be Her finite home.

# To Beget, Or Not to Beget, That Is the Question: 

Paper 20 vs. Paper 120


_By JJ Johnson_ 

A fascinating and somewhat perplexing part of The Urantia Book has to do with the options presented to our Creator Son in preparation for his final bestowal. One in particular involved life choices that all mortals face: whether to take a mate and whether or not to have offspring. However, in Jesus' case the counsel was that no offspring can be left behind. 

Jesus, before baptism, could have had offspring (with the caveat that he could not leave them behind 120:3.8) and it is not in conflict with Paper 20 which states divine Sons could not beget offspring on the worlds of their sojourn. 20:6.2 is referring to the human- **divine Sons** in the last sentence vs. Son of Man ( **human** ) phase described in the first four sentences of this paragraph. 

When study groups are comparing papers 20 and 120, there are two prevailing viewpoints. One view is that paragraphs 20:6.2 and 120:3.8 appear to be inconsistent regarding “leaving offspring behind” vs. “do not beget offspring.” This view holds that “leaving offspring behind” infers that offspring can be had but cannot be left behind. To them, ‘do not beget offspring,’ does not allow for “leaving offspring behind.” One has to beget offspring in order to be advised that they are not to be left behind. This inconsistency continues to perplex new and long-time students of The Urantia Book who view these two statements as having different meanings. This paper will establish that in 120:3.8 Jesus’ elder brother and Paradise counselor, Immanuel, is counseling the Creator Son just before his mortal bestowal that as Jesus of Nazareth (Son of Man) he could have offspring but as Son of Man and Son of God (after his baptism) he cannot leave them behind nor beget offspring as Son of God. This paper provides an acceptable answer that allows papers 20 and 120 to be consistent and at the same time clears up the perplexing view taken that “do not beget” and “leaving no offspring behind” are two different meanings. The other viewpoint is taken by those who think 20:6.2 infers Bestowal Sons cannot have (beget) offspring at all ( **before or after baptism** ). In this view these two passages are accepted as meaning the same thing and therefore consistent. To them, the wording in 120:3.8 is just re-stating 20:6.2 and therefore the two passages mean the same thing. This paper will provide a graceful reception for both views above and will demonstrate a third view in which the first two views can be seen as compatible. 

We begin by examining paragraph 20:6.2 in which a Perfector of Wisdom from Uversa is presenting to us the mortal-bestowal career of a Paradise Son (in our case Michael of Nebadon.) The first four sentences cover his mortal bestowal from infancy through youth to manhood. This is the **human** side of the **human** - divine bestowal. The last sentence in 20:6.2 draws attention to the Son of God, after baptism. This sentence addresses the **divine** side of the human- **divine** bestowal. 

> On a mortal-bestowal mission a Paradise Son is always born of woman and grows up as a male child of the realm, as Jesus did on Urantia. These Sons of supreme service all pass from infancy through youth to manhood just as does a human being. In every respect they become like the mortals of the race into which they are born. They make petitions to the Father as do the children of the realms in which they serve. From a material viewpoint, these human- **divine Sons** live ordinary lives with just one exception: They **do not beget offspring** on the worlds of their sojourn; that is a universal restriction imposed on **all orders** of the **Paradise bestowal Sons**. (All **Bold** my emphasis) [20:6.2]

In paragraph [120:3.8] Immanuel counsels Michael in a farewell conference before his mortal bestowal as the Son of Man. 

> While you will live the normal and average social life of the planet, being a normal individual of the male sex, you **will probably not** enter the marriage relation, which relation would be wholly honorable and consistent with your bestowal; but I must remind you that one of the incarnation mandates of Sonarington forbids the **leaving of human offspring behind** on any planet by a bestowal Son of Paradise origin. [120:3.8].

Additional references are provided below to help make sense of the “forbids the leaving of human **offspring behind** ” vs. “do not **beget offspring** ” dilemma that perplexes those who have no answer to this apparent inconsistency. The other prevailing viewpoint, that the two paragraphs are consistent and the wording means the same in both, does not hold up to scrutiny. The third point of view, outlined in this paper, satisfies the conundrum readers have often found themselves in. It is helpful, in weighing these two papers, to reflect on the specific wordings in bold above in papers 120 and 20 respectively. The nature of The Son of Man before baptism and the Son of Man and Son of God after baptism is different in each case. The free will of Jesus of Nazareth as the Son of Man before baptism is not treated in the same manner after baptism. Before baptism, Jesus was not conscious of the guidance from his elder brother. After baptism and becoming conscious of the guidance from Immanuel, Jesus, now as the Son of Man and Son of God, took action on the “leave no writings behind.” It was not necessary to address the “leaving no offspring behind.” The wording is the same except Jesus did not have to deal with the offspring issue. Before baptism Jesus chose not to enter into marriage; therefore, he did not have to address the “leave no offspring behind” in Immanuel’s counsel. 

Paragraph [129:3.9], given below, should put to rest the question of when Jesus became conscious of Immanuel’s farewell conference. (Immanuel’s counsel included leaving no writings or offspring behind [120:3.7], [120:3.8].) 

> ...The last episode of his prehuman experience to be brought forth by the Adjuster was his farewell conference with Immanuel of Salvington just before his surrender of conscious personality to embark upon the Urantia incarnation. And this final memory picture of prehuman existence was made clear in Jesus’ consciousness on the very day of his baptism by John in the Jordan. [129:3.9]

image Leave No Writing by Russ Docken 

Paragraph [0:5.3] below discloses how the Son of Man and Son of God can coexist in a unified personality, in his present status. This title was given at baptism, not before. After baptism, Christ Michael’s present status is Son of Man and Son of God. This could only happen after his baptism. That’s when Christ Michael picked up this combined title that he experientially earned. 

> On attained experiential levels all personality orders or values are associable and even cocreational. Even God and man can coexist in a unified personality, as is so exquisitely demonstrated in the present status of Christ Michael — Son of Man and Son of God. [0:5.3]

> More of the character and merciful nature of the Eternal Son of mercy you should comprehend as you meditate on the revelation of these divine attributes which was made in loving service by your own Creator Son, onetime Son of Man on earth, **now** the exalted sovereign of your local universe — the Son of Man and the Son of God. [7:7.6]

In the following paragraph, Immanuel is again speaking to Michael in his farewell conference. In his bestowal Jesus, before baptism and as the Son of Man, was under the safekeeping of Gabriel. I surmise that if Jesus as the Son of Man, had contemplated marriage, Gabriel had options. Perhaps he would have informed Jesus of the offspring restriction before baptism. It never came up. 

> In your stead I now reign. I assume jurisdiction of all Nebadon as acting sovereign during the interim of your seventh and mortal bestowal on Urantia. And to you, Gabriel, I commit the safekeeping of the Son of Man about- to-be until he shall presently and in power and glory be returned to me as the Son of Man and the Son of God. And, Gabriel, I am your sovereign until Michael thus returns. [120:3.11]

> Jesus was now thoroughly self- conscious regarding his human existence, his divine pre-existence, and the status of his combined, or fused, human and divine natures. With perfect poise he could at one moment enact the human role or immediately assume the personality prerogatives of the divine nature. [137:4.2]

> Jesus’ devotion to the Father’s will and the service of man was even more than mortal decision and human determination; it was a wholehearted consecration of himself to such an unreserved bestowal of love. No matter how great the fact of the sovereignty of Michael, you must not take the human Jesus away from men. The Master has ascended on high as a man, as well as God; he belongs to men; men belong to him. How unfortunate that religion itself should be so misinterpreted as to take the human Jesus away from struggling mortals! Let not the discussions of the humanity or the divinity of the Christ obscure the saving truth that **Jesus of Nazareth** was a religious man who, **by faith** , achieved the knowing and the doing of the will of God; he was the most truly religious man who has ever lived on Urantia. [196:1.1]

> On the day before the Passover Sabbath, flood tides of spiritual illumination swept through **the mortal mind** of Jesus and filled his human heart to overflowing with affectionate pity for the spiritually blind and morally ignorant multitudes assembled for the celebration of the ancient Passover commemoration. This was one of the most extraordinary days that the Son of God spent in the flesh; and during the night, for the first time in his earth career, there appeared to him an assigned messenger from Salvington, commissioned by Immanuel, who said: “ **The hour has come. It is time that you began to be about your Father’s business.** ” (Such a message, arriving at puberty, may explain why Jesus never contemplated marriage.) [124:6.15]

> Between these two celestial visitations, one in his thirteenth year and the other at his baptism, there occurred nothing supernatural or superhuman in the life of this incarnated Creator Son. Notwithstanding this, the babe of Bethlehem, the lad, youth, and man of Nazareth, was in reality the incarnated Creator of a universe; but he never once used aught of this power, nor did he utilize the guidance of celestial personalities, aside from that of his guardian seraphim, in the living of his human life up to the day of his baptism by John. And we who thus testify know whereof we speak. [128:1.9]

The following additional partial quotes are used to support the above narrative: 

> Consciousness of divinity was a gradual growth in the mind of Jesus up to the occasion of his baptism. After he became fully self-conscious of his divine nature, prehuman existence, and universe prerogatives, he seems to have possessed the power of variously limiting his human consciousness of his divinity. [161:3.1]

> In passing through these events, Jesus chose to be guided by the limited knowledge of his human mind. He desired to undergo the experience with his associates as a mere man. [154:6.10]

Again, as a mere man, before baptism, Jesus was not conscious of the guidance that he is not to leave any offspring behind. Should Jesus have seriously contemplated marriage as a mere man before baptism, one can speculate that Gabriel might have appeared and provided Jesus the guidance from his elder brother that Jesus was not yet conscious of. This never came up like the “leave no writings behind” did and he had to clear that up by destroying his writings after he became conscious of this guidance at his baptism. The point here is to recognize that Jesus of Nazareth as a “mere man,” before baptism, accomplished all that he did with his free will by living faith with the help of only his Thought Adjuster, guardian seraphim and the one message from Immanuel that it was time “to be about your Father’s business.” 

**NB: As a thought provoker consider the following:** For the purpose of this paper, there are three phases/titles to the Creator Son’s incarnation: 
1. before bestowal – Creator Son/Son of God 
2. birth until baptism – Jesus of Nazareth/ Son of Man 
3. after baptism – Exalted sovereign/Son of Man and Son of God 

There is a demarcation at baptism. Baptism ends Jesus’ experience strictly as the Son of Man and he now enters the dual phase as Son of Man and Son of God as he so chooses for the remainder of his bestowal. 

As the Son of Man, before baptism, Jesus lived/experienced his life **“[As] in the Presence** ” of our Paradise Father by the assurance of Faith (100:1.8). Jesus of Nazareth achieved the knowing and the doing of the will of God by ‘ **living faith** in God’ like we all can [196:0.3]. 

As the Son of God, after baptism, Jesus lived/experienced his life ‘[In] the Presence’ of his Paradise Father. It was up to him, as the Son of God, to live the remainder of his bestowal mission sometimes [As] in the Presence (experience more of the mortal bestowal by living faith) or [In] the Presence of God (as Son of God) while completing his bestowal mission. 

It is not within the scope or intent of this paper to speculate on how Jesus, now our Creator Sovereign Son, Master Michael of Nebadon, could do these things on this mortal bestowal. The Urantia Book references in this paper are provided to establish that Jesus, before baptism, could have had offspring (with the caveat that he could not leave them behind) and it is not in conflict with Paper 20 which states divine Sons could not beget offspring on the worlds of their sojourn, referring to the human- **divine Sons** in the last sentence of [20:6.2] vs. Son of Man (human) phase described in the first four sentences of [20:6.2]. 

To the extent the distinctions put forth in this paper (regarding the Son of Man before baptism vs. the Son of God and Son of Man after baptism) foster the appreciation of the **free will** that Jesus of Nazareth was permitted and required to experience by living faith as in the presence of God, I will have achieved my purpose. 

Each generation of Urantia students owe it to future generations to archive thought provoking topics that will enhance our progress toward light and life.

# An Encounter This Unique 

_by Duane R. Johnson_ 

I’m not likely to forget an encounter this unique: 
an epiphany is emerging from my interface 
with the boundaries of Little Lake Shawnee, 
a natural lake for children, our little ones, 
drained while improvements are made. 

Stones, uniformly carved and faithfully fitted 
to this tiny lake’s old shoreline 
form a collar-colored wall, a boundary 
four feet high. 

Coincidentally perhaps, I’ve been pushing 
the envelope of my collared mind 
to explore the expanding boundaries of the evolving God, 
One that grows by embracing and becoming 
the experience of each and every one of us 
in our cornucopic encounters with each other. 

And now, this encounter with a wall, 
intelligently crafted, though unaware of me 
as I tightrope along the edge of it 
to an unfinished spot where there is no wall 
—a 60-foot gap, intended 
for some purpose I don’t comprehend. 

I sense an unspoken promise in that unknown purpose, 
one self-similar to the greater Mystery I’ve been stalking 
as It emerges, self-aware and with holy purpose. 

I believe I’m emerging as well, 
which may explain why I see promise in mystery, 
whereas, in my youth, as a little one, 
I trembled at unknown gaps. 

The next time I visit this part of the park 
I expect I’ll see this puzzle solved. 
Not so with the Mystery that is the evolving God, 
an enigma born at the dawn of time and space 
and promising not to be fully revealed 
until eons from now. 

We have a choice to remain in this unfolding mystery 
sometimes draining ourselves while improvements are made 
fearlessly exploring the supreme intelligence behind the wall, 
all the while being gifted to know 
we are the little ones, and God keeps his promises. 



# Contrasting Jesus and Paul 

_By David Kantor_ 

What we know as Christianity—as well as most of the New Testament—is based almost exclusively on the experience of Paul of Tarsus with “the risen and glorified Christ” on the Damascus Road. 

But Paul never knew the human Jesus--God incarnate, encountering human life as a mortal man. Paul never worked up a sweat with Jesus, hauling in heavy fishing nets from the Sea of Galilee. He never observed Jesus chatting up vendors in the produce market in Capernaum. Paul never knew about Jesus' early struggles as the eldest son in a working-class family making its way in the world. He never sat with Jesus and the apostles around a campfire late into the night listening to the Master talk about his kingdom—a spiritual civilization which pervades our universe. Paul essentially missed the most fundamental element of revelation in the Incarnation—the observation of God living life as a human being in the midst of daily life. 

Key early Christian leaders who had actually spent time with the human Jesus, objected to Paul's teachings. Among them were the Master’s brother James, Peter, Barnabas, Abner, and John Mark. Neither of the two men most influential in the early spread of Paul's teachings--Luke and Marcion--had any experience with the human Jesus. Paul never even read the Gospels; he was dead before they were written. 

It's instructive to contrast the teachings of Jesus with those of Paul: 

Jesus founded the religion of personal experience in doing the will of God and serving the brotherhood of man; Paul founded a religion in which the glorified Christ became the object of worship and the brotherhood consisted of baptized believers in the resurrection and imminent return of the Master. 

Jesus focused on expressing the love of God in the service of humanity; Paul focused on personal salvation for the individual. 

Jesus taught salvation was freely available from God "who knows how to give his children what they need" ([Matthew 7:11](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v11)); For Paul, there needed to be a ritual transaction--Christ had to be "made sin" ([2 Corinthians 5:21](/en/Bible/2_Corinthians/5#v21)) and "handed over for our transgressions" ([Romans 4:25](/en/Bible/Romans/4#v25)). 

Jesus taught that sin is deliberate disloyalty to God; Paul taught that sin was an inescapable element of human nature. 

For Jesus, faith is trust in the Father's watchcare and guidance; for Paul, faith is belief that Christ died for our sins. 

Jesus proclaimed salvation as a gift from God freely available to each individual; Paul proclaimed that Jesus had to purchase salvation for us from an alienated God. 

Jesus described man's relationship to God as that of a child and its loving Father; Paul described it as that of a criminal to a judge. 

For Jesus, the kingdom of heaven is a present reality, here and now; for Paul the kingdom was a future event associated with a second coming and a judgment. 

Jesus taught that we live in the presence of a loving Father; Paul taught that we live in the midst of an evil force seeking to control us. 

The coming reformation will shake the very foundations of Christianity because it will finally replace Paul's morose metaphysics of death with the robust revelation of life which Jesus lived and taught during his mortal sojourn as the Son of Man and the Son of God. ([196:2.1]) 

Said Jesus, “You are to go forth preaching the love of God and the service of man. That which the world needs most to know is: Men are the sons of God, and through faith they can actually realize, and daily experience, this ennobling truth.” ([193:0.4])
