# Letter from Publications Chair Cristina Seaborn 

The Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit are the themes of the 2021 Fellowship Herald. 

How much do we know about either? 

How important is it for us to focus on both the Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit as spiritual resources to help us grow? 

From the insights of these authors, timeline charts of Jesus’ resurrection appearances, Jesus’ message, the fruits of the spirit, adjutant mind spirits, the fruits of divinity, the synergy of both the Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit, we can all grow and learn.

# Cooperating with the Holy Spirit 

_by Kaye Cooper_ 

The Holy Spirit is the personal presence of our Local Universe Mother Spirit, a gentle, yet powerful, stream of her spiritual energy, mercy, patience, love, and wisdom. Our Universe Mother Spirit fosters our ascension through the universe in many ways, through her angels and the adjutant mind-spirits, for example. But her direct personal ministry comes to us through the Holy Spirit. 

## Who is our Local Universe Mother Spirit?

She is the co-creator of this universe and the vast family who lives here. She is the mate, the partner, of our Creator Son, who incarnated on our planet as Jesus of Nazareth. Because Jesus lived as a person on this planet, it is easy for us to imagine our Creator Son. Because _The Urantia Book_ reveals so much about his life, it is easy to know Michael of Nebadon. I love to imagine myself as a small child sitting on Jesus’ lap while he tells a story or talks to me personally. That experience in imagination helps me feel close to Michael through the Spirit of Truth. 

We do not have a human demonstration of our Mother Spirit to help us know her. In fact, outside of _The Urantia Book_ , we have heard very little about her. But we do have a way to experience her and come to know her, because she establishes direct contact with us through the Holy Spirit—her personal presence. Just as our consciousness of the Spirit of Truth enhances our experience of relationship with Michael, so the Holy Spirit gives us an experience of the presence of our Mother Spirit. We have already experienced her. We just may not have realized that our sense of spiritual presence was our Mother Spirit. 

Imagination is given to us for the purpose of connecting spiritually and growing closer to God. Let’s use our imaginations to help us get a sense of our Mother Spirit. Think of the most amazing, unselfish, generous mother you can imagine. Imagine her encouraging her one-year-old toddler son to walk. She calls to him. She reassures him by standing close. She reaches out with her hand and gives him a little bit of help, just enough for him to be successful. He walks a few steps. The child is so proud of his accomplishment. His mother praises his efforts. The child beams and grins ear to ear.

As you enjoy this image, feel the mother’s presence—her love, her patience, her wisdom, her pleasure in her beloved child. Feeling our Mother Spirit is similar. Feeling her presence is possible through contact with the Holy Spirit; and we have been in continuous contact with the Holy Spirit since about the age of five.

## How is the Holy Spirit related to the Infinite Spirit?

We mortals can personally know the Infinite Spirit—the third person of the Trinity—because we can actually experience her goodness and generosity as she “functions as the Holy Spirit” in each local universe. [9:2.5 (100.7)]

We can experience both our Universe Mother Spirit and the third person of the Trinity, because the Infinite Spirit is actually present as our Mother Spirit. Each Local Universe Mother Spirit is a divinity attenuation of the Infinite Spirit. An attenuation is a stepped-down form of the original, so each Mother Spirit is a version—the essence—of the Infinite Spirit.

The Infinite Spirit and the Mother Spirits exude the Motherliness of God. We can see that in the way the Holy Spirit interacts with us. The Infinite Spirit and the Mother Spirit display all the qualities that we recognize as the characteristics of an ideal mother. They love us no matter what. They are warm and welcoming as we turn to them. They laugh with us and delight in our discoveries. They cheer us on as we take our first spiritual steps. They teach us and guide us as we learn and grow. They are patient and encouraging, kind yet firm. They^ are constantly supportive yet allow us to learn by experience. To consciously experience our Mother Spirit is to be drawn closer into the arms of God! That is one of the wonderful benefits of seeking a relationship with the Motherliness of God. 

Our Mother Spirit, along with many other children of the Infinite Spirit, is intensely involved in the “practical affairs” of our daily lives. In fact, we are told to “work out the details” of our lives with these motherly aspects of God. [5:3.5 (66.1)] If you have noticed the hand of God in your ordinary daily life, you have probably recognized the Holy Spirit at work. The Spirit leads us. One of the reasons I think it is important that we pay more attention to her work is this: by becoming aware of what our Mother and her daughters do in our lives and how they work with us, we can better cooperate with her and strengthen her influence on our spiritual growth and development. 

“The Holy Spirit is partly independent of human attitude and partially conditioned by the decisions and cooperation of the will of mortals. Nevertheless, the ministry of the Holy Spirit becomes increasingly effective in the sanctification and spiritualization of the inner life of those mortals who the more fully _obey_ the divine leadings.” [34:5.5 (379.5)] 

So... 

## How do we work out the practical affairs of daily life with the Infinite Spirit and her daughters?

The possibility of receiving help with my daily life interests me tremendously! I am committed to God, my Heavenly Parent. I want to make this great voyage through the universes from material child to morontia being, to spirit, and on to Paradise. I ask to be led. I listen for the Spirit of Truth to tell me the way at each crossroad. 

But I want to take a step further. I want to bring God into my life in each moment of my life. This constant communion will enable me to become more like my spiritual parents! I want to respond to each situation in my ordinary life the way Jesus demonstrated for us. I want to be Godlike in each of my reactions to life. 

_The Urantia Book_ talks about our “enlightened spiritual consciousness” as being concerned “with discovering the truth of living, the good and right technique of reacting to the ever-recurring situations of mortal existence.” [101:9.5 (1115.6)] That is what our Mother Spirit and her daughters work to help us do. They help each of us to react to life in a God-like way. They encourage each of us to become the spiritual person we are destined to become—a beautiful and gracious child of the God of all universes. At any time when we face a decision large or small in daily life, we are face-to-face with an opportunity to seek the Holy Spirit and follow the guidance of our Mother Spirit. Challenges are always opportunities to learn and grow. 

The more we learn how our Mother teaches us through all of her children, the easier we can make their work. And the more we will blossom and grow into the persons we were created to become! It is very much to our advantage to learn how to cooperate with her. 

## How Do We Live Our Religion?

There is one more reason I think it is important to get to know our Mother through her Holy Spirit. Religion passes through three phases as it matures on a planet. 

Primitive human beings made little effort to put their religious convictions into words. Their religion was danced out rather than thought out. Modern mortals have thought out many creeds and created many tests of religious faith. Future religionists must live out their religion, dedicate themselves to the wholehearted service of the brotherhood of humankind. It is high time that human beings had a religious experience so personal and so sublime that it could be realized and expressed only by “feelings that lie too deep for words.” [99:5. (1091.8)] 

It seems obvious that the writers of The Urantia Book put most of the religionists on our planet into the second category—thinking out religion. I see no reason why we, as individuals, cannot move on to the third category of religion—living out our religion, dedicating ourselves to the wholehearted service of the family of mortals. 

The Infinite Spirit is the universal expert on service. Her whole life and ministry is service, a great deal of it focused directly on us mortals! If we feel a call to service, we can be sure our Mother (i.e., the Infinite Spirit, our Mother Spirit, the seraphim) is somehow involved in initiating this experience. 

Everyday life is filled with service opportunities. [See the box “Serving in Everyday Life” nearby for examples.] Serving as we pass by is more than occasionally responding to a need when you happen to see it. It is being aware of our environment, being alert to catch every opportunity presented to us. 

Our Mother’s seraphim work tirelessly to put us into situations where we are invited to be of service to others. That is a big part of their job! Living our religion calls on us to pay attention to these service opportunities of everyday, ordinary life, and to open ourselves to the Holy Spirit’s guidance. Through the Holy Spirit we invite God into our decisions and actions. That is sharing our inner lives with God. That is doing God’s will. 

> “The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God” [111:5.1 (1221.2)] 

Being useful in service to others stimulates our spiritual growth and contributes to the spiritual health of those we serve. Think about how it changes us when we become constantly aware of the opportunities for service with which we are surrounded! Our internal lives are transformed. Our priorities change. We pay attention to being of service...all the time. And joy blooms in moment-to-moment life. Jesus promised “righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.” [34:6.13 (381.7) and 137:8. (1536.6)] Joy is the result of serving. I invite you to get acquainted with our Mother Spirit through her Holy Spirit and accept the abundant help she gives us to live our religion. 

## Serving in Everyday Life 
Our Universe Mother Spirit’s seraphim work tirelessly to put us into situations where we are invited to be of service to others: 

- The person you approach who needs eye contact with kind, understanding eyes. 
- The child of whatever age who needs to be heard by a supportive person. 
- A family member who has gotten angry at you because stress has built up in their life. 
- The electric company employee who has orders to butcher the trees in your yard to protect their power lines. (It can’t be easy meeting so much resistance daily!) 
- The rental tenant who can only make rent payments irregularly because he is fighting a losing battle with cancer—and caring for his two preschool children by himself. 
- The alcoholic who is celebrating three years of sobriety. 
- The home health aide who hasn’t the money for transportation—and you have a reliable old car you were about to sell. 
- A friend who often needs a friendly ear on the other end of her phone because she must spend long hours in the hospital during the COVID- 19 pandemic with her husband who has Alzheimer’s. 
- Grocery store clerks, delivery people, receptionists, tellers, panhandlers, noisy teens, fussy babies, and crabby neighbors who need you to see them as human beings who need attention and care. 

Don’t dismiss the importance of responding to these service opportunities because they so commonly occur. We just need to pay attention, open ourselves to the Holy Spirit’s guidance, and act with love in our hearts. 

# Mother and Father

_by Sharon Porter_ 

Our Urantia Book teaches us that we have a Universe Mother and a Universe Father and that they are our spiritual parents. It states that they both are coequal creators as well as coequal administrators. “A Creator Son ... and a Creative Spirit ... created you and your universe ... [and they] minister to the creatures of their own making.” [8:3.4 (93.6)] 

As Urantians, we need to keep the bow of our boat well pointed into the wave of change. The forward thinking authors of our book brought us new ideas and ideals of change. 

All throughout our book we read passages that show us the feminine face of God. She is our Paradise Mother Spirit, our Eternal Mother Son and the Supreme. But more importantly in our own Universe, she is our spiritual Mother who brings us her Holy Spirit. And she stands equally beside our spiritual Father and his Spirit of Truth. Together they represent the **_balance_** of Spirit, the Yin and Yang, Mother and Father, female and male. **She is a new revelation to this world.** 

That is the good “news” that our Urantia Book is bringing to our torn world! Urantia is a world fallen into rebellion. Consequently, we lack knowledge and wisdom that our more advanced neighbors have, but we have _The Urantia Book_. 

I firmly believe that our movement could become alive and infect the world with this radical new knowledge of our spiritual Mother and Father. 

At times, it feels like we have locked Her up, hid Her inside a closet and almost shut the door. In some groups, among old and new readers alike, the talk is very much about Michael, our Creator Son, and hardly ever does our Mother Spirit come into the picture. It is as if She is second class or not as important to us as He is. Our Universe Mother Spirit is the one who works with us personally every day, minute by minute through Her Holy Spirit and Her angels to lead us, guide us, and support us in our daily spiritual lives. 

I believe that our own angels and our special angels of progress are asking this of us - to be more balanced as on other non-rebellion-torn worlds. There they love, honor and respect our Universe Mother and our Universe Father as their Universal spiritual parents and creators. This is the good news our beloved Urantia Book teaches us. We are fishing for souls who are ready to seek truth with these teachings! 

> “Divine executioners are masterful manipulators of that which is in the interests of that which ought to be.” [25:3:5] 

There are three distinct spirit circuits that inhabit our world and our Universe. They are: 1) Our Divine Mother and her Holy Spirit, 2) our Divine Father and his Spirit of Truth and 3) the Adjutant Mind Spirits. 

When we find our balance in our movement, when we really fully embrace God as our Mother and Father, when we live and are led by not only The Spirit of Truth, but also by the Holy Spirit, then I hope and believe that our Urantia Movement will come alive. It will flourish and blossom like never before. Then will our hungry youths rush to find the beautiful teachings that our book espouses!

# Poem to our Parents 

_by Sharon Porter_

I don’t need to wait ‘til Father’s Day to tell you my Father, Creator Michael, to say, 
I love you Father 
Buying you a gift our dear Divine Mother would be in excess, 
just another fad, to say to you I love you Mother, 
my Creator, would be to tell the truth 
Thank you dear Divine Parents for being my mom and dad 
for being my real parents 
for creating me, 
loving me, nurturing and teaching me 
Oh, what Majestic Beauties You Are! 
Thank You 

# Living with the Spirit of Truth 

_by Esther Wood_ 

My theory is this: What the adjutants do for the mortal mind, the Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit do for soul consciousness. 

I’ve known the Spirit of Truth for as long as I can remember. I’ve always known God was real because I experienced Divine Presence since I was a child. To me, God has always been a wise loving Person who guides me into truth, beauty, and goodness as I seek to do God’s will. This doesn’t mean I’ve been a [first circler](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_1) since I first gave my life to God when I was nine years old. But it did give me the opportunity to start growing into my full capacity. I prayed to a Person in my mind because I believed God was real. Everyone I knew believed God was real. The problem was, I grew up in a home in which Jesus' teachings were _talked about_ more than _practiced_. 

My mother was a closet alcoholic. She wasn’t an honest person, though she tried to be. Her faith was strong and she wrote poetry and beautiful songs praising God. But her actions were based on her fears and she wasn’t willing to admit her weaknesses. She held on tight to memories of what she thought other people did wrong and when she got angry at my dad, she spewed out every single one of those grudges at him. My siblings and I called it “the Tape;” we all heard it almost every night. She spent so much energy preserving those beliefs that she had little left for her creative _purpose_. 

Since I was her firstborn and failed to be a son, she didn’t like me. I knew she consciously tried to love me, but subconsciously, she treated me with hostility. Looking back on my childhood, I can see why I retreated into my soul out in nature. I grew up on a farm, next to a river, with lots of woods to explore. I could walk and talk to God about what happened and I asked for help in coping. 

While hoeing beanfields with my brother (who was a year younger than me) we talked about Mom’s behavior, how she yelled at Dad every night. My brother knew as well as I did that she favored him over me and how unfair that was. Looking back on our talks, I’d say we could see these inconsistencies because we both knew Jesus’ teachings and compared her to those standards. Even as a preteen, I was conscious enough to know that my brother wasn’t to blame for the way Mom treated me but, being so young, I was very much in the dark about how to understand my feelings about myself and the people around me. It helped to talk about the Tape with him. We were allies in seeing how unfair Mom was. At that time, we had no way of knowing about Dad’s passive-aggressive behavior because we were so focused on Mom’s screaming and hadn’t learned enough about life to put our experiences into perspective. 

It took a lot of research and therapy over many years before I could finally recognize the difference between what my beliefs are and what God reveals about life. I’m thankful for my childhood now; it was the pain of feeling motherless that drove me to learn about my mind so I could finally make sense of my disordered childhood. By turning my mind Godward I was able to identify with the part of me that looked at my emotions and behaviors objectively enough to keep me from getting lost in them. Unfortunately, I wasn’t conscious enough to process my emotions in a healthy way. 

I grew up in the sixties and experimented with psychotropic drugs along with my cohorts. Most of the time, my drug of choice was alcohol. It covered up my painful feelings of orphanhood. I was a hippy and learning about God in ways I never could have when I attended church, and yet the Presence of God was becoming more real to me. Every time I transcended my doubts and searched for truth, I experienced a flow of Consciousness that was bigger than my own. This I knew as the Spirit of Truth, the Comforter. Because I grew up feeling shy, I often relied on a verse in Matthew to help me get to the state of mind where I could trust Jesus to help me through challenging, and sometimes dangerous, situations. Whenever I feared to speak, this verse reminded me that I wasn’t alone. 

> “When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour.” ([Matt. 10:19](/en/Bible/Matthew/10#v19)) 

After spending two years in college, I left Michigan with my friend Grace and my dog Gypsy to hitchhike across the United States. I used that verse as sort of a mantra so I could free myself of the limiting beliefs I grew up with. At that time, I had no idea what I was doing. I was just experiencing life with God in my mind on my quest to learn more context in the world. 

Trusting God helped me stay present with the people I met along the way, which was an adventure to see where God would lead. It was a pilgrimage for me (although I didn’t know it at the time), a journey to find the “edge” of God. 

I already knew God was real beyond the church but, at that time, I didn’t know how far I could adventure into other religions and practices before the truth blurred. I encountered a lot of times when I had to rely on God to get me through and I never doubted He would. At least I don’t remember worrying about it. I recall one kindly farmer who gave Grace, Gypsy, and me a ride somewhere in the Midwest; he said he was concerned about our safety and I told him about God. He drove us a lot farther than he’d planned because he saw us as being in the Kingdom too. He said he’d picked us up because we reminded him of his daughters and our faith had confirmed his hunch to do so. 

We met a lot of other people who continued to reinforce our faith. God truly does bring souls together for growth. I learned through experience that “when the student is ready a Teacher will appear,” as Buddhist philosophy teaches. The interesting thing about being on a search for truth is that, when you transcend fear in order to focus more on what God is leading you to know, the answers come in ways that reveal greater glimpses of reality. 

A year after I settled in Portland, Oregon, I found _The Urantia Book_ and it opened me up to an even greater reality. I found my mantra verse in there, presented in a larger context that clarified a lot of meaning for me. Jesus was warning his Apostles they would be harassed by their enemies and that they would be given help to speak their truth when their trials came. 

> “And when our enemies bring you before the rulers of the synagogues and before other high authorities, be not concerned about what you should say and be not anxious as to how you should answer their questions, **for the spirit that dwells within you shall certainly teach you in that very hour** [emphasis added] what you should say in honor of the gospel of the kingdom.” [165:3.7 (1820.6)] 

Jesus said that “he who has seen me has seen the Father,” therefore when I turn my consciousness toward God, I first “see” the Spirit of Truth. I’ve come to realize the “edge” I was looking for is within myself. I choose how to see my world, whether it is a fearful place or a place with God at the center. I can either fall into the limiting beliefs of my childhood programming or see my world as an opportunity to cocreate with the Divine. 

I’ve found the best way for me to recognize God is to know what God is not. _The Urantia Book_ teaches us all about our mind, which is my favorite subject. I’ve come to realize how the adjutants function in my mind and this is helping me to distinguish the parts that are more animal than spiritual. The lower adjutants operate my behaviors subconsciously unless I make a conscious effort to be aware of what I perceive, feel, think, and intend. 

Fear is a driving force meant to keep us alert enough to survive. Our first three adjutants are primed to respond to fear and deal with it in a hurry: Attend—Process—Act. The creature freezes, perceives information, triggering a flood of biochemicals to rush through the body according to patterns based on memories of previous experiences (and in humans, the beliefs associated with them). This determines the energy that manifests as the emotion that determines the character of action, either flight or fight. The other option is faith, but that requires higher mind functioning, in order to override the basic animal process. 

The first three adjutants to activate mind comprise the activity in what’s been called the Reptilian brain. Intuition attends to basic survival needs. There are other reflexes besides fear that trigger behavior, such as hunger, disgust, pleasure, and pain. Believe it or not, vanity is a survival trigger too. It traces its IndoEuropean roots back to the same as “want,” meaning “void, empty.” These indicate needs that determine the direction in which a creature invests its energy in order to achieve its goal. Survival depends on fulfilling needs, the primary ones first. As creature needs are met, intuition triggers thoughts and behaviors to fulfill such higher needs as finding meanings and values in life. 

Understanding can best be understood as conditioned learning. Pavlov’s dogs “learned” to salivate at the sound of a bell because its toll was associated with the arrival of food. This is the level of emotional actions based on previous programmed patterns of emotional response. Memories and beliefs both operate to determine these patterns. At this level, it activates action before thinking takes place. 

The emotional feeling represents the activity of courage, which manifests as behavior. It causes a change to take place, even if it’s within—reinforcing a belief, for example. Our characters are either defensive (manifesting in retreat or offense) or open and willing to learn. Courage triggers action. It’s the motivating adjutant. In the chakra system (based on earlier revelations of the adjutants), it is said to represent will. We do what we want, despite our intentions. This is the “unruly beast” of our unconscious actions, but with conscious cooperation with God we can master the animal so we can live most effectively as a citizen while we live here as a mortal being. 

> 1. **The spirit of intuition** [emphasis added]—quick perception, the primitive physical and inherent reflex instincts, the directional and other self-preservative endowments of all mind creations; the only one of the adjutants to function so largely in the lower orders of animal life and the only one to make extensive functional contact with the nonteachable levels of mechanical mind. 
> 
> 2. **The spirit of understanding** [emphasis added]—the impulse of co- ordination, the spontaneous and apparently automatic association of ideas. This is the gift of the co-ordination of acquired knowledge, the phenomenon of quick reasoning, rapid judgment, and prompt decision. 
> 
> 3. **The spirit of courage** [emphasis added]—the fidelity endowment—in personal beings, the basis of character acquirement and the intellectual root of moral stamina and spiritual bravery. When enlightened by facts and inspired by truth, this becomes the secret of the urge of evolutionary ascension by the channels of intelligent and conscientious self-direction.” [36:5.6 (402.3)] 

Courage is also included in a triad with Knowledge and Counsel; this triad being the mindal construct commonly referred to as our ego, the part we identify with, our self- consciousness. A mind that is able to appease the fear-triggers is able to transcend into a more curious state of consciousness, which allows learning to occur. Taking in new information and experimenting with new concepts allows growth to take place. Playing and the scientific method both spring from this instinct. Art dabbles in this frame of consciousness as well. Science reverberates with Causality, one of the three Cosmic Intuitions. 

> 4. **The spirit of knowledge** [emphasis added]—the curiosity-mother of adventure and discovery, the scientific spirit; the guide and faithful associate of the spirits of courage and counsel; the urge to direct the endowments of courage into useful and progressive paths of growth. 
> 
> 5. **The spirit of counsel** [emphasis added]—the social urge, the endowment of species co-operation; the ability of will creatures to harmonize with their fellows; the origin of the gregarious instinct among the more lowly creatures.” [36:5.9 (402.6)] 

It’s curious to note that “faith” and “fidelity” stem from the same etymological root which means “to believe.” We crave order and are inclined to defend what we believe, because that’s what helps give us a sense of control over our lives. We need to believe we have the ability to do things in our environment so we can accomplish our goals, which are always based on our unfulfilled needs (whether consciously and unconsciously). Our beliefs control our triggers so that we can be more likely to survive the dangers of this world. We experience perceived dangers as well as real dangers, and we’ve reached the social stage of development such that we are able to comprehend that we can view our dangers more objectively. We can evaluate our beliefs and why we perceive certain stimuli as dangerous and others as neutral or beneficial. 

It took me a while to realize that I was not what I thought I was in relation to my life. I found true relief when I realized that I have the power to change my beliefs. It’s a process of being willing to acknowledge what I feel and use this information to help me find my purpose and to serve God, this process of finding myself and expressing my truth. The Revelators tell us we are meant to learn with others in this life we’re living now. 

> “Human self-consciousness implies the recognition of the reality of selves other than the conscious self and further implies that such awareness is mutual; that the self is known as it knows. This is shown in a purely human manner in man's social life. But you cannot become so absolutely certain of a fellow being's reality as you can of the reality of the presence of God that lives within you. The social consciousness is not inalienable like the God-consciousness; it is a cultural development and is dependent on knowledge, symbols, and the contributions of the constitutive endowments of man—science, morality, and religion. And these cosmic gifts, socialized, constitute civilization.” [16:9.4 (195.10)] 

The first five adjutants comprise the body- mind levels of our Local Universe Mother’s consciousness that we share with animals and other non-personal beings, such as perhaps, frandalanks and chronoldeks. Plants represent mechanical mind, bees work amazing things at the level of intuition, lizards are able to flee from danger and attack other creatures. Wolf pups play with each other and learn how to live within the pack. Humans share traits with all these other living beings, but we also share mindal capacities with Midwayers and other spiritual beings. 

As soon as my consciousness ventures into the realms beyond matter, my intellectual belief system is challenged with either a fear or love response. Either way, there’s a powerful realization that no matter how much I know or am able to learn, no matter how much information our whole society has gathered and put to good use, there remains more beyond our grasp. This should be nothing but a humbling experience. I am grateful to know that God knows more than I do. And I am willing to trust God more so that I can expand the breadth of my social consciousness in fellowship. This is helping me to learn to be who I am and to express the truth of my being more effective over the length of my experiences through time and on into eternity. 

> 6. **The spirit of worship** [emphasis added]—the religious impulse, the first differential urge separating mind creatures into the two basic classes of mortal existence. The spirit of worship forever distinguishes the animal of its association from the soulless creatures of mind endowment. Worship is the badge of spiritual-ascension candidacy. 
> 
7. **The spirit of wisdom** [emphasis added]—the inherent tendency of all moral creatures towards orderly and progressive evolutionary advancement. This is the highest of the adjutants, the spirit co-ordinator and articulator of the work of all the others. This spirit is the secret of that inborn urge of mind creatures which initiates and maintains the practical and effective program of the ascending scale of existence; that gift of living things which accounts for their inexplicable ability to survive and, in survival, to utilize the co-ordination of all their past experience and present opportunities for the acquisition of all of everything that all of the other six mental ministers can mobilize in the mind of the organism concerned. Wisdom is the acme of intellectual performance. Wisdom is the goal of a purely mental and moral existence.” [36:5.11 (402.8)] 

I grew up with a knowledge of God, and for that, I am grateful to my parents, despite their mortal imperfections. I know the value of worship, of being able to recognize the sacred in my world and to be able to personally connect with God, who is love. Religion has always been part of my life. I’ve always expected answers to my prayers and I got them—not always in the way I wanted, but certainly the answers I received helped me in the best way in the long run. I learned more about my purpose here and I’m growing so that I can better serve the Whole. This is my supreme duty. It’s what I choose to do because I want to serve God as authentically as I can. It’s a process and it requires patience because I’m not perfect and neither is anyone else around me. 

> “ _The seventh [psychic] circle_. This level is entered when human beings develop the powers of personal choice, individual decision, moral responsibility, and the capacity for the attainment of spiritual individuality. This signifies the united function of the seven adjutant mind-spirits under the direction of the spirit of wisdom, the encircuitment of the mortal creature in the influence of the Holy Spirit, and, on Urantia, the first functioning of the Spirit of Truth, together with the reception of a Thought Adjuster in the mortal mind. Entrance upon the seventh circle constitutes a mortal creature, a truly potential citizen of the local universe.” [110:6.13 (1210.8)] 

I appreciate elevating my attention into Soul consciousness, which was born in me when I attained enough consciousness to activate my seventh adjutant by making a moral choice (around five years old). Worship attracted the Holy Spirit to my mind, which facilitated the activation of wisdom, giving me the capacity for moral consciousness and personality growth. 

> “Faith-insight, or **spiritual intuition, is the endowment of the cosmic mind in association with the Thought Adjuster** [emphasis added], which is the Father's gift to man. Spiritual reason, **soul intelligence, is the endowment of the Holy Spirit** [emphasis added], the Creative Spirit's gift to man. Spiritual philosophy, the **wisdom of spirit realities, is the endowment of the Spirit of Truth** [emphasis added], the combined gift of the bestowal Sons to the children of men. And the co-ordination and interassociation of these spirit endowments constitute man a spirit personality in potential destiny.” [101:3.2 (1108.1)] 

My awareness of the cosmic intuitions, which activate worship, duty, and science, allows me to connect my experiential depth with my vertical attainment of higher levels of consciousness. 

> “The cosmic mind unfailingly responds (recognizes response) on three levels of universe reality. These responses are self-evident to clear-reasoning and deep-thinking minds. These levels of reality are: 
> 
> 1. _Causation—_ the reality domain of the physical senses, the scientific realms of logical uniformity, the differentiation of the factual and the nonfactual, reflective conclusions based on cosmic response. This is the mathematical form of the cosmic discrimination. 
> 
> 2. _Duty—_ the reality domain of morals in the philosophic realm, the arena of reason, the recognition of relative right and wrong. This is the judicial form of the cosmic discrimination. 
> 
> 3. _Worship—_ the spiritual domain of the reality of religious experience, the personal realization of divine fellowship, the recognition of spirit values, the assurance of eternal survival, the ascent from the status of servants of God to the joy and liberty of the sons of God. This is the highest insight of the cosmic mind, the reverential and worshipful form of the cosmic discrimination. 
> 
> These scientific, moral, and spiritual insights, these cosmic responses, are innate in the cosmic mind, which endows all will creatures. The experience of living never fails to develop these three cosmic intuitions; they are constitutive in the self - consciousness of reflective thinking. But it is sad to record that so few persons on Urantia take delight in cultivating these qualities of courageous and independent cosmic thinking.” [16:6.5 (192.1)] 

My goal is to master my adjutant mind so that I can facilitate growth in my soul consciousness. Therefore I aim to be a first circler so that my beloved Adjuster has more room to express whatever needs to be said through my living being. I am willing to submit and learn and grow because life is far more interesting that way. My soul’s consciousness started in the adjutant of wisdom; and as I grow with my Adjuster, we’re expanding our soul consciousness “out” into intuition, so that my unconscious actions can be more in harmony with God’s will. 

> “ _The first [psychic] circle_. The Adjuster cannot, ordinarily, speak directly and immediately with you until you attain the first and final circle of progressive mortal achievement. This level represents the highest possible realization of mind-Adjuster relationship in the human experience prior to the liberation of the evolving morontia soul from the habiliments of the material body. Concerning mind, emotions, and cosmic insight, this achievement of the first psychic circle is the nearest possible approach of material mind and spirit Adjuster in human experience.” [110:6.15 (1210.10)] 

I love God and seek to grow in every dimension that I can, so that my Adjuster and I can attain the best realization of our relationship, so that I can be a more effective sharer of the gospel. My Thought Adjuster resides at the “nucleus” of my personality, so therefore, it behooves me to still my mind so that I am more able to become conscious of this Divine Presence within, which helps me to recognize the Divine Presence working in the world around me. As I understand how my adjutant mind works, I am better able to submit its workings to directionalize my intuitional reflexes so that I am harmonizing with the spiritual beings working in my life. 

> “Personality has a perfected range of cosmic dimensional performance. The dimensions of finite personality are three, and they are roughly functional as follows: 
> 
> 1. _Length_ represents direction and nature of progression—movement through space and according to time— evolution. 
> 
> 2. _Vertical depth_ embraces the organismal drives and attitudes, the varying levels of self-realization and the general phenomenon of reaction to environment. 
> 
> 3. _Breadth_ embraces the domain of co - ordination, association, and selfhood organization.” [112:1.5 (1226.9)] 

> “The finite dimensions of personality have to do with cosmic length, depth, and breadth. Length denotes meaning; depth signifies value; breadth embraces insight—the capacity to experience unchallengeable consciousness of cosmic reality.” [112:1.10 (1226.14)] 

I am inspired by the fact that I am not alone; I accept the invitation to become more than I am now. Jesus has always inspired me to pursue truth and to live it. The Urantia revelation is showing me that the Spirit of Truth and Holy Spirit exert almighty power in my soul, which God within has birthed within me. This gives me the chance to experience supreme values and hopefully to help others to discover more meaning in their lives as well. 

> “But we know that there dwells within the human mind a fragment of God, and that there sojourns with the human soul the Spirit of Truth; and we further know that **these spirit forces conspire** [emphasis added] to enable material man to grasp the reality of spiritual values and to comprehend the philosophy of universe meanings. But even more certainly we know that these **spirits of the Divine Presence** [emphasis added] are able to assist man in the spiritual appropriation of all truth contributory to the enhancement of the ever-progressing reality of personal religious experience— God-consciousness.” [0:12.13 (17.2)] 

> “The mind-experience accumulations of the seven adjutant mind-spirits, in their ministry to the physical level of intellect, are a part of the local universe experience of the Divine Minister, and through this Creative Spirit they probably find registry in the mind of Supremacy. 
> 
> Likewise are mortal experiences with the Spirit of Truth and the Holy Spirit probably registered by similar techniques in the person of Supremacy.” [117:5. (1287.1)] 

Jesus gave us this gift of himself, the Spirit of Truth, so that we might more surely find the Father through his experience, and he offers insights when we’re willing to exchange our mind for his. I know from experience that it really helps to know this, especially when I am aware that my reflexive triggers could hijack my behaviors if I don’t do something proactive: 

> “Even on Urantia, these seraphim teach the everlasting truth: If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, who always serves you well.” [48:6.26 (553.7)] 

# Song for Papa’s Family 

Dear Friends, I have written a poem inspired by a brief and famous verse by the celebrated English Victorian poet, Robert Browning, “Pippa Passes.” The poem I have written takes Browning's as its base, from which I have composed a poem of my own. My poem is intended to express the idea that, no matter on what universe level we may find ourselves, whether on earth or upon some higher sphere—we shall always maintain an awareness of the reality of the personality relationships and group identities we established here on earth. True and real relationships we form and develop here—whether as friends or fellows, in families or teamwork groups—will continue to relate us, each to each and all together, as we continue to pursue God’s plan, to better comprehend it, and thereby further cultivate the fellowship we formed on Earth. 

Our unity of purpose, our voluntary teamwork, continues ever afterward to vitalize our relationships on ever-heightening levels. Personality relationships, as we know, are an end in themselves. As such they are among the tiny number of revealed realities that can be distinguished in that way. Like the personalities themselves of which they are composed, personality relationships maintain a constant value. They are possessed of a unique and unaltering reality, an enduring and final survival value, that never can or ever shall be diminished or destroyed to any degree. Personality relationships as unique universe realities will only be rendered more profound, more enriched, and more meaningful by the numberless, expanding and diversifying experiences that lie ahead throughout our lengthy and intriguing universe journeys. 

All of us are one in love, unified by one purpose, and united in one destiny, forever to pursue and to realize our Creator’s never- ending plan of universe expansion. We are one family who together make real the fullness of our Father’s dreams. 

## Song for Papa’s Family 

by David Glass 

The year is at autumn, arriving so soon, 
The morning’s at seven and climbing toward noon, 
The lark has ascended, she sails through the sky, 
The snail’s on the thorn, though he’s looking on high. 
God's in Havona, but dwells in us too, 
Singing a love song to each one of you. 
Spirit, advancing through all cosmic space, 
Transmits our love to our friends in their place. 
Whether in heaven or Earth we may seek 
To do God’s will, there the Spirit will speak, 
Saying to each of us: “This is the way. 
Let no misgivings come near you today. 
Whether or not your friends walk by your side, 
Walk in My light, let My love be your guide.” 
We know the truth that expands every day 
Leading us all to that new brighter day 
We seek by our service to manifest here 
At one with our friends on higher new spheres. 
Knowing our labors with theirs are entwined 
We sense how deeply our wills are aligned, 
Bridging the gap that seems otherwise strong 
When all sing together God’s “uni-verse” song, 
That “one-song” of love and of spirit divine 
That unites our service as upward we climb. 
We have assurances, here and above: 
Nothing is greater or stronger than Love. 
It links each level of heaven and earth, 
Bringing from losses a sense of rebirth: 
We honor One Spirit and serve but One Son. 
Whatever our station, our efforts are one. 
Our voices in unison sing out our praise 
With hope for the future to last all our days. 
Our service is cosmic wherever we strive. 
That oneness of spirit unites all our lives 
To do all the biddings of Light and of Love 
Till God's reign on Earth is like that above. 

# Of Two Minds: Human and Divine 

_by Richard Bain_ 

Both Christian theology and _The Urantia Book_ affirm that Jesus was both human and divine. In orthodox Christian theology, Jesus is portrayed as the second person of the Trinity, God the Son. This is his divine nature according to that theology. _The Urantia Book_ authors tell us that Jesus was indwelt by Christ Michael, a Creator Son, a Godlike being who is a creator and the spiritual head of the local universe of Nebadon. Jesus’ divine nature consisted of this being who indwelt him. 

According to orthodox Christian theology, the divine Christ incarnated on earth to die on a cross to atone for the sins of humankind. But the authors of _The Urantia Book_ reject that concept. They refer to him as Christ Michael and say he incarnated here so he could experience life as a mortal and complete the requirements to qualify as a sovereign Master Creator Son. As far as I know, while Christian theology doesn’t address this requirement, _The Urantia Book_ addresses it in a few places. 

In this article I try to determine how the two minds or consciousnesses within Jesus interacted and which was speaking at a particular time. There are a few statements in The Urantia Book that refer to the two minds [136:4.4 (1514.5)], but to determine which mind is apparently speaking at a particular time, or if they are speaking as one, requires some analysis of what is being said. Such analysis may sometimes lead us in the wrong direction, but in the absence of quotes from the authors of The Urantia Book , analysis and speculation are the only tools we have in our toolbox, so we use them. With that caveat in mind, the following is my effort to determine who is most likely speaking, the human or the divine. 

As I stated previously, _The Urantia Book_ indicates that Jesus had both human and divine consciousnesses, that both minds existed within Jesus. The authors confirm that the self- consciousness of Christ Michael was at first limited, perhaps as a condition of incarnation, and Jesus at first wasn’t conscious of the divine mind within. It appears that the divine mind of Christ Michael slowly began to appear as the human Jesus matured. Nevertheless, Christ Michael’s impressions of the world were limited to those received through the senses of the human Jesus. Perhaps during Jesus’ early years, Christ Michael was mostly a passive participant in Jesus’ life experiences. But did he begin to contribute thoughts as Jesus began his transition from childhood to adulthood? At what point did Christ Michael achieve self- consciousness in the mind of Jesus? 

The Urantia Book authors conclude that Jesus first became aware of his divine nature, his dual nature, when he was age thirteen. He came to the full awareness of his divinity at his baptism by John. That appears to be the point at which Christ Michael achieved full self-consciousness within Jesus. They conclude that it was a process of discovery and not instantaneous. Note that here they do not speak of the two minds as separate self- consciousnesses. 

> “Of his human nature he was never in doubt; it was self-evident and always present in his consciousness. But of his divine nature there was always room for doubt and conjecture, at least this was true right up to the event of his baptism. The self-realization of divinity was a slow and, from the human standpoint, a natural evolutionary revelation. This revelation and self-realization of divinity began in Jerusalem when he was not quite thirteen years old with the first supernatural occurrence of his human existence; and this experience of effecting the self-realization of his divine nature was completed at the time of his second supernatural experience while in the flesh, the episode attendant upon his baptism by John in the Jordan, which event marked the beginning of his public career of ministry and teaching.” [128:1.8 (1408.5)] 
> 
> “On this Mediterranean journey Jesus made great advances in his human task of mastering the material and mortal mind, and his indwelling Adjuster made great progress in the ascension and spiritual conquest of this same human intellect. By the end of this tour Jesus virtually knew—with all human certainty—that he was a Son of God, a Creator Son of the Universal Father. The Adjuster more and more was able to bring up in the mind of the Son of Man shadowy memories of his Paradise experience in association with his divine Father ere he ever came to organize and administer this local universe of Nebadon. Thus did the Adjuster, little by little, bring to Jesus' human consciousness those necessary memories of his former and divine existence in the various epochs of the well-nigh eternal past. The last episode of his prehuman experience to be brought forth by the Adjuster was his farewell conference with Immanuel of Salvington just before his surrender of conscious personality to embark upon the Urantia incarnation. And this final memory picture of prehuman existence was made clear in Jesus' consciousness on the very day of his baptism by John in the Jordan.” [129:3.9 (1424.4)] 

Image The Baptism by Greg Olsen 

Did the two minds communicate and confer about things? Yes they did. 

> “These forty days were the occasion of the final conference between the human and the divine minds, or rather the first real functioning of these two minds as now made one. The results of this momentous season of meditation demonstrated conclusively that the divine mind has triumphantly and spiritually dominated the human intellect. The mind of man has become the mind of God from this time on, and though the selfhood of the mind of man is ever present, always does this spiritualized human mind say, ‘Not my will but yours be done.’” [136:4. (1514.5)]
> 
>  “After more than five weeks of unbroken communion with his Paradise Father, Jesus became absolutely assured of his nature and of the certainty of his triumph over the material levels of time- space personality manifestation. He fully believed in, and did not hesitate to assert, the ascendancy of his divine nature over his human nature.” [134:8. (1493.4)] 

So, does the human Jesus become only a passive observer after his divine self becomes dominant? It doesn’t seem that way. 

## The Wedding at Cana

It appears that it was the human Jesus who reacted to events at the wedding at Cana. First, the human Jesus was irritated with Mary and James and rebuked them. Notice the terms, “characteristic indignation.” This was a characteristic the human Jesus had inherited from his mother. 

> “Jesus derived much of his unusual gentleness and marvelous sympathetic understanding of human nature from his father; he inherited his gift as a great teacher and his tremendous capacity for righteous indignation from his mother.” [122:5.3 (1348.3)] 
> 
> “Early in the afternoon Mary summoned James, and together they made bold to approach Jesus to inquire if he would admit them to his confidence to the extent of informing them at what hour and at what point in connection with the wedding ceremonies he had planned to manifest himself as the “supernatural one.” No sooner had they spoken of these matters to Jesus than they saw they had aroused his characteristic indignation. He said only: ‘If you love me, then be willing to tarry with me while I wait upon the will of my Father who is in heaven.’ But the eloquence of his rebuke lay in the expression of his face.” [137:4.4 (1529.1)] 

He was irritated a second time, this time with just his mother. 

> “As Jesus was standing alone in a corner of the garden, his mother approached him, saying, ‘My son, they have no wine.’ And Jesus answered, ‘My good woman, what have I to do with that?’ Said Mary, ‘But I believe your hour has come; cannot you help us?’ Jesus replied: ‘Again I declare that I have not come to do things in this wise. Why do you trouble me again with these matters?’ And then, breaking down in tears, Mary entreated him, ‘But, my son, I promised them that you would help us; won't you please do something for me?’ And then spoke Jesus: ‘Woman, what have you to do with making such promises? See that you do it not again. We must in all things wait upon the will of the Father in heaven.’ [137:4. (1529.5)] 

image Jesus at the wedding in Cana by William Hole 

But as Mary broke down in tears, the human Jesus and possibly the Christ Michael consciousness were compassionate and unconsciously did what they had intended not to do. 

> “Mary the mother of Jesus was crushed; she was stunned! As she stood there before him motionless, with the tears streaming down her face, the human heart of Jesus was overcome with compassion for the woman who had borne him in the flesh; and bending forward, he laid his hand tenderly upon her head, saying: ‘Now, now, Mother Mary, grieve not over my apparently hard sayings, for have I not many times told you that I have come only to do the will of my heavenly Father? Most gladly would I do what you ask of me if it were a part of the Father's will—’ and Jesus stopped short, he hesitated. Mary seemed to sense that something was happening. Leaping up, she threw her arms around Jesus' neck, kissed him, and rushed off to the servants' quarters, saying, ‘Whatever my son says, that do.’ But Jesus said nothing. He now realized that he had already said—or rather desirefully thought—too much.” [137:4. (1530.1)] 

## Jesus by the Sea

Andrew sees Jesus weeping by the sea; this seems a reaction of the human Jesus rather than Christ Michael. 

> “Just before leaving, the apostles missed the Master, and Andrew went out to find him. After a brief search he found Jesus sitting in a boat down the beach, and he was weeping. ... [and Jesus said] ‘No one of you has grieved me. I am saddened only because none of my father Joseph's family have remembered to come over to bid us Godspeed.’ At this time Ruth was on a visit to her brother Joseph at Nazareth. Other members of his family were kept away by pride, disappointment, misunderstanding, and petty resentment indulged as a result of hurt feelings.” [141:0.2 (1587.2)] 

image Jesus Casts Out The Money-Changers by William Hole 

## Cleansing the Temple

Again, that “characteristic indignation” is aroused in the human Jesus. 

> “As Jesus was about to begin his address, two things happened to arrest his attention. At the money table of a near-by exchanger a violent and heated argument had arisen over the alleged overcharging of a Jew from Alexandria, while at the same moment the air was rent by the bellowing of a drove of some one hundred bullocks which was being driven from one section of the animal pens to another. As Jesus paused, silently but thoughtfully contemplating this scene of commerce and confusion, close by he beheld a simple-minded Galilean, a man he had once talked with in Iron, being ridiculed and jostled about by supercilious and would-be superior Judeans; and all of this combined to produce one of those strange and periodic uprisings of indignant emotion in the soul of Jesus.” [173:1.6 (1890.1)] ”
> 
> To the amazement of his apostles, standing near at hand, who refrained from participation in what so soon followed, Jesus stepped down from the teaching platform and, going over to the lad who was driving the cattle through the court, took from him his whip of cords and swiftly drove the animals from the temple. But that was not all; he strode majestically before the wondering gaze of the thousands assembled in the temple court to the farthest cattle pen and proceeded to open the gates of every stall and to drive out the imprisoned animals. By this time the assembled pilgrims were electrified, and with uproarious shouting they moved toward the bazaars and began to overturn the tables of the money-changers. In less than five minutes all commerce had been swept from the temple. By the time the near-by Roman guards had appeared on the scene, all was quiet, and the crowds had become orderly; Jesus, returning to the speaker's stand, spoke to the multitude: ‘You have this day witnessed that which is written in the Scriptures: “My house shall be called a house of prayer for all nations, but you have made it a den of robbers.” ’ ” [173:1.7 (1890.2)] 

But of course, there are many times when it’s Christ Michael speaking, not the human Jesus. Such times as when Jesus said, “Who has seen me has seen the Father,” or, “The Father and I are one.” At other times, it may be the unified voice of Christ Michael and the human Jesus speaking. 

## Going to Jerusalem

I have recently pondered on this: Why did Jesus go to Jerusalem during Passover, thus placing himself in harm’s way? It was because Christ Michael knew what would happen, so the human Jesus knew as well. Was it God’s will for Jesus to be arrested and crucified? If so, then apparently the human Jesus didn’t know this or needed confirmation, so he prayed to God to ask if it was God’s will that he be crucified. Is it possible that Christ Michael decided to end his human experience in this way? Why would he do that? Consider the alternatives: Jesus could have died of old age, then be resurrected, or he could have just vanished like Melchizedek then reappear after a few days as a morontia being. But would these alternatives satisfy the Father’s will? The authors answer these questions. 

> “The Father in heaven desired the bestowal Son to finish his earth career naturally, just as all mortals must finish up their lives on earth and in the flesh. Ordinary men and women cannot expect to have their last hours on earth and the supervening episode of death made easy by a special dispensation. Accordingly, Jesus elected to lay down his life in the flesh in the manner which was in keeping with the outworking of natural events, and he steadfastly refused to extricate himself from the cruel clutches of a wicked conspiracy of inhuman events which swept on with horrible certainty toward his unbelievable humiliation and ignominious death. And every bit of all this astounding manifestation of hatred and this unprecedented demonstration of cruelty was the work of evil men and wicked mortals. God in heaven did not will it, neither did the archenemies of Jesus dictate it, though they did much to insure that unthinking and evil mortals would thus reject the bestowal Son. Even the father of sin turned his face away from the excruciating horror of the scene of the crucifixion.” [183:1.2 (1972.1)] 

image Can you not watch with me even for one hour? by James Tissot 

## In the Garden of Gethsemane 

The human Jesus asked if this cup could be lifted from him. The answer was apparently no. Jesus asked a total of three times if he must drink the cup. This was the second time: 

> “The Master remained in a prayerful attitude for a few moments, and then, going over to the three apostles, he found them sound asleep, for their eyes were heavy and they could not remain awake. As Jesus awoke them, he said: ‘What! can you not watch with me even for one hour? Cannot you see that my soul is exceedingly sorrowful, even to death, and that I crave your companionship?’ After the three had aroused from their slumber, the Master again went apart by himself and, falling down on the ground, again prayed: ‘Father, I know it is possible to avoid this cup—all things are possible with you— but I have come to do your will, and while this is a bitter cup, I would drink it if it is your will.’ And when he had thus prayed, a mighty angel came down by his side and, speaking to him, touched him and strengthened him.” [182:3.2 (1968.3)] 

image Christ in the Garden of Gethsemane by Béla Iványi Grünwald 

By the third time Jesus prayed, he had fully accepted the Father’s will that he should go through with the ordeal of the crucifixion. 

> “And then, for a third time, the Master withdrew and prayed: ‘Father, you see my sleeping apostles; have mercy upon them. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak. And now, O Father, if this cup may not pass, then would I drink it. Not my will, but yours, be done.’ And when he had finished praying, he lay for a moment prostrate on the ground. When he arose and went back to his apostles, once more he found them asleep. He surveyed them and, with a pitying gesture, tenderly said: ‘Sleep on now and take your rest; the time of decision is past. The hour is now upon us wherein the Son of Man will be betrayed into the hands of his enemies.’ As he reached down to shake them that he might awaken them, he said: ‘Arise, let us be going back to the camp, for, behold, he who betrays me is at hand, and the hour has come when my flock shall be scattered. But I have already told you about these things.’” [182:3.4 (1968.5)]. 

It is certainly understandable that the human Jesus would be so distraught because Christ Michael could discern the future and so Jesus apparently knew in detail the ordeal he was to pass through. And Christ Michael would also feel the pain and humiliation of the crucifixion, but was he in the same amount of distress as the human Jesus? We don’t know. Is it possible Christ Michael foresaw that he would be remembered as a sacrifice to an offended God and was unhappy with that? But he also foresaw that his actual teachings would eventually become the word of truth to all humankind. 

## Jesus On the Cross 

Christ Michael undoubtedly experienced all the pain and humiliation that the human Jesus did as part of his human experience, but only the human Jesus died on the cross. The authors indicate that Christ Michael was present in some form in some administrative proceedings in the local universe of Nebadon during the three days that Jesus' body was in the tomb. 

> “The Creator consciousness of Michael must have been at large and wholly free from its associated mortal mind of the physical incarnation.” [188:3.6 (2015.2)] 
> 
> ”There are records extant which show that during this period the supreme council of Salvington, numbering one hundred, held an executive meeting on Urantia under the presidency of Gabriel. There are also records showing that the Ancients of Days of Uversa communicated with Michael regarding the status of the universe of Nebadon during this time.” [188:3.12 (2016.1)] 
> 
> “We know that at least one message passed between Michael and Immanuel on Salvington while the Master's body lay in the tomb.” [188:3.13 (2016.2)] 
> 
> “There is good reason for believing that some personality sat in the seat of Caligastia in the system council of the Planetary Princes on Jerusem which convened while the body of Jesus rested in the tomb.” [188:3.14 (2016.3)] 
> 
> “The records of Edentia indicate that the Constellation Father of Norlatiadek was on Urantia, and that he received instructions from Michael during this time of the tomb.” [188:3.15 (2016.4)] 
> 
> “And there is much other evidence which suggests that not all of the personality of Jesus was asleep and unconscious during this time of apparent physical death.” [188:3.16 (2016.5)] 

So Christ Michael was active during the three days Jesus was in the tomb and unaware of anything. Then came the resurrection when Jesus appeared in morontia form, but was the mortal Jesus a part of the resurrected person? Our unseen friends are apparently divided on this issue. Some think the mortal Jesus was still with Christ Michael in morontia form, but others disagree. 

> “We are not able fully to explain just what happened to Jesus of Nazareth during this period of a day and a half when he was supposed to be resting in Joseph's new tomb. Apparently he died the same natural death on the cross as would any other mortal in the same circumstances. We heard him say, ‘Father, into your hands I commend my spirit.’ We do not fully understand the meaning of such a statement inasmuch as his Thought Adjuster had long since been personalized and so maintained an existence apart from Jesus' mortal being. The Master's Personalized Adjuster could in no sense be affected by his physical death on the cross. That which Jesus put in the Father's hands for the time being must have been the spirit counterpart of the Adjuster's early work in spiritizing the mortal mind so as to provide for the transfer of the transcript of the human experience to the mansion worlds. There must have been some spiritual reality in the experience of Jesus which was analogous to the spirit nature, or soul, of the faith-growing mortals of the spheres. But this is merely our opinion—we do not really know what Jesus commended to his Father.” [188:3.4 (2014.7)] 
> 
> “The acquired spirit identity of the man of Nazareth which was built up during his lifetime in the flesh, first, by the direct efforts of his Thought Adjuster, and later, by his own perfect adjustment between the physical necessities and the spiritual requirements of the ideal mortal existence, as it was affected by his never- ceasing choice of the Father's will, must have been consigned to the custody of the Paradise Father. Whether or not this spirit reality returned to become a part of the resurrected personality, we do not know, but we believe it did. But there are those in the universe who hold that this soul-identity of Jesus now reposes in the ‘bosom of the Father,’ to be subsequently released for leadership of the Nebadon Corps of the Finality in their undisclosed destiny in connection with the uncreated universes of the unorganized realms of outer space.” [188:3.8 (2015.4)] 

The two preceding quotes inform us of an important point; Jesus was indwelt by two spiritual beings, Christ Michael and a thought adjuster. It seems that the human Jesus’ interaction with his thought adjuster was just the same as our interaction is with ours. Jesus moved up through the psychic circles by following adjuster guidance just as we do. Only the end result was different; Jesus did not fuse with his adjuster; his adjuster was personalized. Christ Michael would experience just what Jesus was experiencing, but would he be involved in any way? Perhaps Christ Michael conferred with Jesus’ adjuster, but in order to experience the purely human nature of the interaction, it seems to me Michael wouldn’t have intervened in the human-adjuster interaction. If this is true, then Jesus’ work with his adjuster was a purely human experience. 

So when we finally meet Christ Michael in person, will he seem like the human Jesus as well as a Creator Son? It seems to me that even if the resurrected soul of the human Jesus isn’t a part of Christ Michael, some aspect of Michael’s personality will seem familiar to us due to his experiencing the mortal life of Jesus. Of course, he will also manifest the awesome presence of a Creator Son. It will be among the most memorable experiences of our ascension career!

# Divine Synergy 

_by Chuck Thurston_ 

The concept of “synergy” first appeared in theology and the natural sciences in the mid- nineteenth century, but with a meaning that was less focused than today’s understanding of the term. It was not until later, after _The Urantia Book_ was published, that the idea of synergy came into popular use with the definition that we have today: 

Synergy: The interaction of two or more agents or forces so that their combined effect is greater than the sum of their individual effects. 

While the term “synergy” does not appear in _The Urantia Book_ , the word “superadditive” is used three times, and with a meaning that is closely related to our present-day understanding of synergy. It’s interesting to note that today’s online definitions of “superadditive” place it exclusively in the field of mathematics. This suggests that the Urantia Book authors regarded it as the best available term at the time, and gave it added meaning to suit their purposes. 

Even without a commonly understood word for it, this idea that collaborative efforts can produce results that are greater than the “sum of the contributing parts” comes up many times in the book. It’s such an important concept, and it especially characterizes all of the many complemental personality relationships that are described in the book, from human gender, to seraphic guardians, to parental deity. I would go so far as to suggest that we can state this as a fundamental universe principle: 

## Complemental Synergy Creates Superadditive Outcomes

The partnership of our Creator Son and Creative Mother Spirit is clearly a major example of this. 

> “AT THE head of all personality in Nebadon stands the Creator and Master Son, Michael, the universe father and sovereign. Co-ordinate in divinity and complemental in creative attributes is the local universe Mother Spirit, the Divine Minister of Salvington.” [37:0.1 (406.1)] 
> 
> “From this central universe also came the bestowal of the personal prerogatives of creatorship which a Universe Divine Minister employs as complemental to a Creator Son in the work of creating living will creatures.” [14:6.35 (162.10)] 

Our very existence as living beings on a universe stage is a superadditive consequence of the creative potential of their divine union. We are more than a predictable sum of independent efforts. The synergy of their complemental natures brings entirely new realities into existence. 

Given the complemental relationship of our local universe deity parents, it seems reasonable to expect that the nature and functioning of their spirit presence circuits—the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Truth—would also be functionally complemental in their ministry and influence. If true, this could give us a helpful handle on understanding how these gifts work together to support and inspire our spiritual growth. 

The introduction to [Paper 34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34) gives us a striking observation of the complemental functioning of Michael and our local universe Mother Spirit: 

> “In physical creation the Universe Son provides the pattern while the Universe Spirit initiates the materialization of physical realities. The Son operates in the power designs, but the Spirit transforms these energy creations into physical substances.” [34:0.3 (374.3)] 

This capacity of our Creative Mother Spirit to function so intimately in the processes of physical creation is very mother-like. This, and her later provision of mind circuits, both flow from her origin as a direct offspring of the Third Source and Center: 

> “From the earliest association with the Creator Son the Universe Spirit possesses all the physical-control attributes of the Infinite Spirit... Upon the attainment of personal status the Universe Spirit exerts just as full and complete control of mind gravity, in the local universe, as would the Infinite Spirit if personally present.” [34:2.2 (375.5)] 

Consistent with her origin in the Infinite Spirit, we also learn that our Mother Spirit is a Third Source personality. Unlike Michael, who “flashed full-fledged” into existence at the moment of his origin [21:1.1 (234.6)], her personal nature has emerged in stages (see [paper 17, section 6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/17#p6) for more), and has only recently become fully recognizable to all, following Michael’s final bestowal: 

> “subsequent to the elevation of the Creator Son to the sovereign authority of a Master Son, the Creative Mother Spirit becomes so augmented in personal qualities as to be personally recognized by all contacting individuals.” [34:2.1 (375.4)] 

We are also informed that Creative Spirits are “in a class by themselves” in relation to First Source personalities (like ourselves and Michael) who are encircuited in the Father’s personality circuit: 

> “There are numerous types of Third Source personalities. The Infinite Spirit bestows Third Source personality upon numerous groups... Likewise does the Infinite Spirit treat as personalities numerous groups of beings, such as the Creative Spirits, who are in a class by themselves in their relations to encircuited creatures of the Father.” [9:8.11 (106.9)] 

What could this mean? At the very least, I think this again suggests that the influence of her Holy Spirit will be unlike, but complemental to our experiences with the Spirit of Truth. 

From the clue above about their differing roles in universe creation, it seems plausible to assume that the Holy Spirit has a special relationship to physical realities, while the Spirit of Truth is more involved with pattern and design. But there are also intriguing spiritual differences to consider, especially after the universe of their making becomes populated with evolving mortals. For example, with the arrival of Thought Adjusters, we now have a “threefold spirit endowment:” 

> “Since the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth, man is subject to the teaching and guidance of a threefold spirit endowment: the spirit of the Father, the Thought Adjuster; the spirit of the Son, the Spirit of Truth; the spirit of the Spirit, the Holy Spirit.” [194:2.11 (2061.9)]

While these gifts of uplifting spirit influence are unified in functional harmony, they also have essential complemental differences: 

1. The personal influence of the Holy Spirit is a pervading presence: 

    “From and through this new personal segregation of the Conjoint Creator there proceed the established currents and the ordained circuits of spirit power and spiritual influence destined to pervade all the worlds and beings of that local universe.” [34:1.2 (375.1)] 
    (Online definitions of pervaded: diffused throughout every part, can be perceived in every part, exists in every part, is present throughout.
    “She is equally and diffusely present throughout her entire local universe” [34:3.3 (376.6)]

2. The Spirit of Truth is an enveloping, companion presence: 

    “This new gift is the spirit of living truth... And you shall know this spirit when he comes even as you have known me... In the times to come I will be with you and all other men who desire my presence, wherever you may be, and with each of you at the same time.” [180:4.1 (1948.2)] 
    “And as the spirit fragment of the Father dwells within you, so does the spirit presence of the Son envelop you” [6:5.7 (78.3)] 

3. And the spirit of the Father, of course, is an indwelling presence: “The Father in heaven sends his spirit to indwell the minds of men” [137:8.7 (1536.4)] 

There are other interesting statements that describe complemental differences between the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Truth, for example: 

> “Spiritual reason, soul intelligence, is the endowment of the Holy Spirit, the Creative Spirit's gift to man. Spiritual philosophy, the wisdom of spirit realities, is the endowment of the Spirit of Truth, the combined gift of the bestowal Sons to the children of men.” [101:3.2 (1108.1)] 

And here: 

> “the encircuited action of the Holy Spirit.” [113:4.6 (1245.6)] The Infinite Spirit source of the Holy Spirit is the God of Action, the activator of pattern. (see 9:3.8 (101.8)) 
> 
> “the Son-consciousness of the Spirit of Truth.” [113:4.6 (1245.6)] “Our God realization career begins with the recognition of the divinity of the Creator Son.” (see 0:8.9 (11.13)) 

Consider these comments that describe the functioning of the Holy Spirit: 

> “ The Holy Spirit —this is the initial supermind bestowal... This ministry to a worship-craving and wisdom-desiring mind creates the capacity to self-realize the postulate of human survival” [92:0.4 (1003.4)] 
> 
> “Man's first supermind endowment is that of personality encircuitment in the Holy Spirit... this influence functions to enlarge man's viewpoint of ethics, religion, and spirituality.” [103:0.1 (1129.1)] 
> 
> “When mind is thus endowed with the ministry of the Holy Spirit, it possesses the capacity for (consciously or unconsciously) choosing the spiritual presence of the Universal Father” [34:5.4 (379.4)] 
> 
> “The Mother Spirit of Salvington knows you fully, for the Holy Spirit on your world ‘searches all things,’” [28:5.22 (313.4)] 
> 
> “The Holy Spirit is partly independent of human attitude” [34:5.5 (379.5)] 

Compare with these comments that describe the functioning of the Spirit of Truth: 

> “This divine endowment is not the letter or law of truth, neither is it to function as the form or expression of truth. The new teacher is the conviction of truth ” [180:5.1 (1949.3)] 
> 
> “The spirit which my Father and I shall send into the world is not only the Spirit of Truth but also the spirit of idealistic beauty.” [155:6.11 (1732.4)] 
> 
> “The proof... of your fellowship with the Spirit of Truth is not to be found in your consciousness of this spirit but rather in your experience of enhanced fellowship with Michael.” [194:2.4 (2061.2)] 
> 
> “The Spirit of Truth is concerned primarily with the revelation of the Father's spirit nature and the Son's moral character.” [194:3.1 (2062.10)] 
> 
> “the Spirit of Truth, who directs the loving contact of one human being with another.” [180:5.11 (1950.6)] 

I see a couple of patterns that stand out in these descriptions. 

1. The Holy Spirit is our first gift of spirit encircuitment. As noted earlier, this presence pervades us, and its early functioning may be largely unconscious. The Holy Spirit seems to be mostly concerned with creating fertile conditions for conscious engagement with the spirits of the Father and the Son. While the Mother Spirit knows us very well (as we would expect of a good mother), she isn’t working to draw attention to herself. Her focus instead seems to be mainly on ministry, coordination, and support, which is consistent with her Third Source nature. 
2. The Spirit of Truth, on the other hand, is all about inspiring our personal relationships, both human and divine. This includes our development of conscious desire for truth, beauty, and goodness. Given that the Spirit of Truth is our functional access to the spirit presence of Jesus, our relationship with his spirit is both highly personal and intended to grow in reciprocal companionship. 

This is not to say that we can’t become equally conscious of the Holy Spirit, and thereby develop a uniquely personal and growing relationship with our Mother Spirit. What I find exciting about this possibility is that it will be a different kind of relationship than we have with the Father, with Michael, or with other First Source personalities, including our human friends. 

One of the outstanding characteristics of our Mother Spirit is her everywhere-present nature that pervades all things and beings in her local universe. We cannot physically touch our Thought Adjuster or the Spirit of Truth, even though they may be very near and dear in our hearts and minds. But we can engage physically with the presence of the Holy Spirit. We can feel the pervading presence of the Mother Spirit in our body, and we can literally commune with her through loving and affectionate touch. 

This may be an unexplored realm for many of us, but I think it might be what Jesus had in mind when he said: 

> “But you who have been called out of darkness into the light are expected to believe with a whole heart; your faith shall dominate the combined attitudes of body, mind, and spirit.” [155:6.17 (1733.5)] 

By pointing to our consciousness of body, mind, and spirit, I think we can now see that Jesus was anticipating our awakening awareness of the threefold endowment of the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of Truth, and the indwelling presence of the Father. 

Our creative partnership with these endowments of spirit presence, as they are unified in our experience by angelic ministry, puts us on a path of human-divine synergy that enables our discovery and development of a new and potentially eternal reality — our morontia soul identity. This emerging version of ourselves will be an endless revelation of superadditive possibilities that we could never

# Introduce Urantia Teachings to 15,000 People Per Month 

_by Jena Lassiter_ 

Many of us have introduced the teachings to people we know. Our lives are richer because of our understanding of _The Urantia Book_ teachings. Many of us believe that there would be more joy and peace in the world if everyone on the planet could see that our physical lives here are a part of a larger journey as spirit beings. I am so inspired by the teachings that I have tried to introduce the book to my friends and family hoping that they could experience a similar transformation. 

Now we are in an age where people are finding information not just through conversations with family and friends but by “going online.” Just in the last hour, I’ve read or listened to the words of ten strangers and _talked_ to zero friends or acquaintances. Whenever I have questions about anything, I will go to my computer or phone or tablet and look for an answer, rather than talking with people I know. 

The Urantia Book Fellowship (The Fellowship) has around 15,000 people coming to its website every month (an average of about 500 site visitors per day). Thanks to someone’s insight several years ago, the Fellowship applied for and received a Google Ad grant for Google text ads worth $40,000 per month at no expense to us. We have used this grant to create Google Ads and are using nearly all of this grant every month. That is, we are “spending” around $40,000 every month with our ads. Google Ads explained: wordstream.com/google-ads 

Visitors are from all over the world but are mostly from the USA and are mostly under 45 years old. They spend an average of 30 seconds on the site and then leave. Many of us think they spend so little time on the site because most ads take them directly into The Urantia Book online. For the modern, young, site visitor, digging through the text they are directed to probably doesn’t meet their needs for their search. Websites today commonly contain beautiful images, some brief text, and videos. Can the Fellowship deliver content that better meets those search needs? 

The Stepping Stones Program was created last year with the goal of introducing the concepts of The Urantia Book to site visitors without the expectation that those visitors will read the book (although we hope to introduce the book where and when appropriate). Here’s our plan: 

1. Create pages on our website that answer questions with Urantia-Book- based content, beautiful images, and videos. 
2. Create a way for moderators who are Urantia Book readers to have fellowship with interested site visitors. 
3. Create Google Ad Campaigns for each topic using targeted keywords. Details: Create pages on our website that answer questions with Urantia-Book- based content and beautiful images. Example here (note, the link to “conversations” is not yet working): urantiabook.org/Take-Charge-of-Your- Own-Spiritual-Growth/ Include short videos of people sharing their truths about these topics without directly referencing _The Urantia Book._ 
       - a. Include longer videos that incorporate those “testimonial videos” with paraphrased quotes from _The Urantia Book._ 
       - b. As the site visitor goes deeper into the path, begin to introduce The Urantia Book as appropriate. 
4. Create a way for moderators who are Urantia Book readers to have fellowship with site visitors. The idea is that we all grow through discussing our questions with one another. 
    - a. These conversations will be through scheduled video conversations. (We hope to eventually offer a chat feature but are starting with video conversations first.) 
    - b. We hope to be able to direct some of the conversations to _The Urantia Book_ when appropriate. 
5. Create Google Ad Campaigns for each topic using targeted keywords to bring people to the pages we’ve created. Keywords explained here: ahrefs.com/ blog/what-are-keywords/. 
6. Measure the results of our campaigns and then modify as appropriate; try again. 

We encourage content creators to use their creativity and passion to decide on the path of content they want to create for a new site visitor. We use mind-map tools (see mindmapping.com/mind-map) when possible to break down the content into bite-size pieces. We also encourage a focus on the audience they are trying to attract. One of our members, Albert Einstein Lassiter, has considerable experience in user personas and how to maximize website participation using that information. For example, some user personas are: UB Newbie, General; UB Newbie, Anti- Church; and UB Newbie, God-Knowing. 

The team working on the Stepping Stones Program recognize the sensitive nature of website exploration. If people doing searches in Google click on an ad and get past initial mild interest and see relevant content, they may begin to openly explore the website. They may then even be inclined to return to our website later. Google Analytics gives us the ability to see what they clicked on and also see what page they left from. That knowledge can inform our improvement process. 

A key feature is to create interaction early on, rather than just presenting something to read. When people start to engage, spiritual growth happens. In fellowship we grow. Links appear on the landing pages to move beyond initial images, videos, and words and enables the visitor to talk to someone. Moderators will be trained to listen and stay with concepts rather than leading with The Urantia Book specifically. 

Training will be available so moderators will know how to truly listen and support loving interactions—to positively represent the Fellowship. We are working with Urantia University International to help with the training of moderators. 

Topics being worked on currently are family, grief, spiritual growth, spiritual conversations, life purpose (i.e. Why are we here?), and life after death. 

The team working on the Stepping Stones Program believes that there is great potential for reaching thousands of new people every month with teachings from The Urantia Book. If you want to help we need: 

1. People to create videos of themselves talking about our topics 
2. Content creators; people to do the writing that will end up on the website 
3. Conversation moderators to talk to people who want to talk to us 
4. If you are among the more technical folk, we especially need Google Ad creators and people familiar with Google Analytics. 

You can contact jena.lassiter@urantiabook.org for more information about how to help. 

Training will be available so moderators will know how to truly listen and support loving interactions—to positively represent the Fellowship.

# To Our Mother Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Giver of Mind 

by Mary Huggins 

Me: I so wish to truly KNOW you! 

MY CHILD, 

I am as close as your thoughts 
I give mind 
I am as close as your beating heart 
I give life 
I am as close as your lungs 
I give breath 
I am as close as your body 
I give being to your very cells. 

See me in the minds and bodies of those you love, 
in acquaintances, in strangers passing by, 
in those you fear, even your enemies. 
See me especially in those who would destroy you. 
All these are your brothers and sisters, my children, 
they are my beloveds, just as you are, my adored child. 

See me in the trees and clouds and grass, 
even in the vegetables you grow for food. 
See me in the cows, the pigs, the chickens, 
the creatures of the sea, created to nourish you. 
See me also in the weeds you dig up, 
and the bears and lions and wolves whom you fear. 

See me in your animal friends and pets, 
dogs and cats and horses, 
birds even lizards and snakes 
yet the tiniest bugs and myriad insects. 
They are all a part of me. 
Each has his role to play. 

See me in the natural beauty around you— 
green plants and blue sky, fall colors, 
spring flowers, that delicious spring green, 
that impossible blue sky behind the magnificent sunset. 
I am in the winter drab as well as the snowy white. 
See me in landscapes beyond your imagination, 
mountains and valleys, rocks, oceans and rushing rivers 
canyons and majestic vistas. 

See me in harmonious paintings, sculptures, 
even buildings and landscapes created with human hands. 
See me in poetry and music birthed 
by my gift of mind used to express 
both practical and spiritual relationships. 
You see, I am in and of all that is around and within you. 
You are of me and I am of you. 
Yet I am not you and I am still more than you, 
I am myself. 
I am. 

This is how you will know me, child: pay attention to what is there, look with spiritual eyes, with the intention of finding me. In wanting and longing to know me, you already know me. Continue coming to me in quiet times, in times of fun and laughter, in good food and companionship, in hard labor and in your rest. As I am everywhere, will you find me, but only because you seek me. If you do not seek me, I am hidden, nowhere to be seen. Seeking is the key. Seeking me opens many doors. 

Seek me, my beloved child. I answer each and every sincere call. 

I love you very much, dear one. 


Your Mother, whom you know as the Holy Spirit

# Sojourner of the Soul: Gardener of our Hearts 

_by Tom Choquette_ 

This sharing is based on my personal journey into partnership with the Spirit of Truth. The spirit of our beloved Jesus—our spiritual trainer and true north, the gardener of our hearts— resides within those that are honest and sincere of heart and willing to do His bidding. 

Any child of God who is searching for spiritual truths, by this action alone, is proof that they are indwelt by both the Spirit of Truth and a fragment of our Father. 

If we acknowledge the presence of, and instructions from this wonderful Source from the Divine, He will guide us to truth and bless us with the ability to share those truths with all of God’s children. He promises us this for our generation and all generations to come. The primary purpose of the Spirit of Truth is to live in and through us, to restate the message of Jesus to the world in which we live. We have been chosen as messengers to share the love of God with all. 

(Editor's note: Beloved refers to the divine spark of God that indwells each one of us.) 

Our Beloved, the Thought Adjuster, needs the Spirit of Truth to indwell us. That which would become our eternal partner (our Thought Adjuster) relies on the Spirit of Truth to approach each of Their children just as each of us is reliant upon the Spirit of Truth to begin our eternal dance with the Divine. The Thought Adjusters are not universally bestowed until the Spirit of Truth is poured out on those sincere and honest of heart. And that only happens after a Creator Son has accomplished all seven of His bestowals. The Spirit of Truth makes way for the Beloved to discover us, and in turn, for us to discover the Infinite within. 

I have found that the reward for making a sincere, honest choice to devote my ministry here on this world to doing the will of God by following the word of God, is the blessing of the conscious recognition of my Lord and Master, Jesus, within me. Jesus’ embrace is indescribably delicious. His partnership is the spiritual lifeline for our very existence in the here and now and the launchpad to life eternal. 

I am becoming more aware of the various spiritual energies that clamor to assist us in our becoming one with our eternal partners. I am thankful for the adjutants, our angels, the Holy Spirit, the touch of the Beloved and other spiritual influences that allow us to tread the path of the Infinite. For the most part, in this article, I purposely leave out our Thought Adjusters’ indispensable influence and energy. This article is meant to be an adventure with the Spirit of Truth. This is perhaps one of the most overlooked and critical spiritual influences available to us young spiritual fledglings. 

## The Passion of Personal Revelation Started to Grow Within Me 

The Urantia Book found me 50 years ago. It was a dark, cold, and windy night. Well, maybe not so much. I was actually with two wonderful friends in front of a roaring fire in the heart of Alaska. 

My romance with The Urantia Book was slow and methodical—adrift on a sea of doubt and hope, confusion and clarity, curiosity and satisfaction—and then one day the passion of personal revelation started to grow from living the facts of our epochal revelation (i.e., The Urantia Book ). As I applied the directions of The Urantia Book in my life, the gift of true knowledge emerged from my actions, awakening a personal revelation within my heart. My mind connected with the facts of The Urantia Book and my life was forever changed. It took a while for the revelation of The Urantia Book to touch my heart and ignite an insatiable desire to know and serve our Master (Jesus). Sometimes, it seems, the twelve inches from head to heart is a mile wide. Revelation as an epochal phenomenon is periodic but as a personal human experience it is continuous. As I lean in closer to the Divine in my life, I find this to be unconditionally true. 

God has already given me more than I could have ever dreamed of. And His giving through the Spirit of Truth has no limits. His main desire is to give each of us as much as we can imagine and even more. His conditions are: serve the Father’s children, and turn your will over to the Father’s will. The real beauty of this promise is that we can make the decision to partner with the Spirit of Truth at any time in our lives. The Divine is patient and the option to choose the Beloved’s love is always within reach and available to us. 

I was, for a long time, a Jesus apologist. Christianity had soured anything that was associated with the risen Christ for me. I guess I was ashamed of aligning with any symbol attached to Christianity. I took solace in the deeper studies of The Urantia Book , and developed a strong relationship with our Mother Spirit through service to Her children without and communing with the Beloved within. 

I cannot point to any given moment in time when I became aware of my spiritual folly. I had made the assumption that I could develop a relationship with God without turning my life over to the direction of His Son—the word of God—without allowing me to be nurtured and led by the Spirit of Truth, a necessary step for cuddling up more closely with my Beloved.

Some Discoveries Made Along the Journey 

We are told that through the Spirit of Truth and His leadings we will be led into a **conscious** relationship with Jesus. I have found this to be true, as we all can. Let me share some of the discoveries I have made. They are the journey from my mind to my heart, from belief to faith, from knowing to doing, from my will to God’s will that allowed me to become consciously aware of the Spirit within. 

These discoveries come in no particular chronology. They are not in order of importance or personal awareness. They are the gatherings of an unfinished jigsaw puzzle, a puzzle each of us will put together differently— a puzzle that with each piece added leads us closer to the heart of God and His will for us and the growth of the Supreme. I will list several quote references at the end of this article to introduce you more fully to our indispensable, priceless, merciful, Spirit of Truth. 

The coming of the Spirit of Truth at Pentecost endowed us with the ability to forgive personal injuries. Consider this quote: 

> ”Pentecost endowed mortal man with the power to forgive personal injuries, to keep sweet in the midst of the gravest injustice, to remain unmoved in the face of appalling danger, and to challenge the evils of hate and anger by the fearless acts of love and forbearance.” [194:3.12 (2064.4)] 

This quote was the beginning of an awareness of how the Divine clearly communicates with and empowers each of us, perhaps not in any language of the realm, but in the “language of the gods.” The Spirit of Truth was poured out upon this world at Pentecost. I realized that our ability to forgive, promote peace or minister mercy was directly linked to our relationship with the Spirit of Truth, with Jesus. More importantly it is the Son’s forgiveness that flows out from within us, should we let it. With our permission we learn to forgive, promote peace and understand the language of mercy from the Son. _This is true ***conscious*** communion with the Son through the Spirit of Truth. _

## Jesus Lives Anew in Us and Through Us 

On Pentecost the Spirit of Truth became the personal gift from the Master to every one of us that are _honest and sincere of heart_. The main purpose for this bestowal was to qualify each believer to more readily share the love of God and offer the friendship of God to all. We of the revelation are blessed with this knowledge. Should we do something other than what the Master asks? 

We are told that Jesus, through the Spirit of Truth, lives anew in the experience of every truth-taught believer. The Master lives through us, if we only allow it. He will guide us unerringly into the love of the Father and out into the ministry of all of His children if we will just accept this deeply sought after and privileged position. We are told that Thought Adjusters flock to a world such as ours in the hopes of partnering with a child of God dedicated to doing the will of God, to become one with Him. We each have the ability to consummate this desire of our Beloved by following the directions and leadings of the Spirit of Truth. Wow! 

The Spirit of Truth asks us to reveal truth to the world around us by allowing the love of the Divine to pass through our personal experience and into the lives of others. We must remake ourselves into fountains of living truth, (born again), and share that truth with those that hunger. We, in partnership with the Spirit within, create a living pathway through which those who are lost can find their way home. We are the ones who spread the crumbs that identify a path through the dark forest floor to the illuminated valley waiting to embrace all who come—to the very source of love. 

Shutterstock 604026941 

There is so much more to say regarding this wonderful partner and eternal friend that we have residing in us. My heart is filled to bursting. May you all share in His grace. A gift beyond imagining. 

Consciously, or unconsciously, the Spirit of Truth is an inseparable part of our hearts, much as our cellular structure is to our body. Without our cells, our bodies would simply dissolve. Without the Spirit of Truth, our hearts would harden and madness would drift into our lives. How fortunate the world is. 

Love you all this day, and the infinite days to come. Tom

# Proclaim the Holiday of Holidays—May 18 

Michael Confirmed as Universe Sovereign, Mother's Greater Personal Revealing 

by Bro. Joshua J. Wilson 

Edited by Elianne Obadia 

## The Coronation 

May 18 is a good day to celebrate our universe's Jubilee of Jubilees. August 21 is a big day also: Jesus' birth as a mortal. April 9 was an astounding day: Jesus' resurrection into morontia form. But on May 18 the people of Urantia have the opportunity to lead the way in all Nebadon—on Salvington, Edentia, Jerusem, and all inhabited planets—the jubilee celebration of Michael's confirmation from the Paradise Father of his completed universe sovereignty, and of the Mother's greater and personal revealing. This is great news. So what happened on May 18, 30 AD? Two great universe events, among several (see Addendum) occurred on that jubilee of jubilees day: 

1. Michael, our Creator Son and universe father, departs for his enthronement on Salvington (UB 33:3.5), and his ascent to the right hand of his Father to receive formal confirmation of his sovereignty of Nebadon. 

    It was about seven forty-five this morning when the morontia Jesus disappeared from the observation of his eleven apostles to begin the ascent to the right hand of his Father, there to receive formal confirmation of his completed sovereignty of the universe of Nebadon. [193:5.5] 

2. Mother, our Creative Spirit, becomes personally knowable by all contacting individuals. 

    To many universe types of being, even this representation of the Infinite Spirit may not appear to be wholly personal during the ages preceding the final Michael bestowal; but subsequent to the elevation of the Creator Son to the sovereign authority of a Master Son, the Creative Mother Spirit becomes **so augmented in personal qualities** as to be personally recognized by all contacting individuals. [34:2.1] 

## Personal relationship with Michael

As part of God the Sevenfold, our Creator Son and our Creative Mother Spirit are, to us, God. They are our creators, our parents, father and mother to us. To be personally related to Michael, the one requirement is that you share your inner life with him. 

> The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God—with the very God who has made such a creature life of inner meaning-value possible. Sharing is Godlike—divine. [111:5.1] 

Michael is the divine word expression of the Father's thought. He is the designer and creator of the patterns and plans for superhuman, human, animal, and plant life on our world and universe. Michael is the minister of the mercy of the Father to all who struggle and are in need. Our relationship with him through his Spirit of Truth, endowed to all believers on Earth after his ascension, imbues us with power to live and share life on the intellectual and spiritual levels of truth-revealing. 

## Personal relationship with Mother

The Thought Adjusters/Controllers do not speak English to us, ordinarily, but rather communicate with us in the symbols of the superconscious. However, the Mother does speak our Earth languages. You may share your thoughts and feelings with her continually throughout the day, which develops into a real and personal dialogue. The conversation begins to take on true meaning through closeness and working out all the details of our life; through listening and obeying; through sincere adoration. 

Over 200 billion years ago our Mother began giving life and nurturance in our universe through her divine spark of life; through her Holy Spirit, through her assisting mind spirits, her angels, and many supernal beings. She likewise initiated life on our little world 550 million years ago, one among many of such loving and creative efforts by her throughout her universe. 

Since Mother is our universe source of mind, it is quite natural that we may find it easier to form concepts of her than of either the Son Michael or the indwelling Father (compare [9:5.4]). She draws all minds in our universe unto herself. She is the flexible actor focalizing all spiritual influences; initiating and upholding all life; coordinating all energy, material, and minds; and pervading all local universe space. The Mother ministers the combined love of the Father and the mercy of Michael, and is therefore also known to us as our Divine Minister. 

Baroncelli Polyptych: Coronation of the Virgin by Giotto Di Bondone 

(paraphrased) The Holy Spirit of the Mother is partly independent of your human attitude—and partially conditioned by the decisions and co- operation of your will. The ministry of the Holy Spirit becomes increasingly effective in sanctifying and spiritualizing your inner life as you more fully obey the divine leadings. [34:5.5] Do what Mom says. 

## The Holiday: The Jubilee of Jubilees

On May 18... 
    call an assembly, 
    send out “Universe Jubilee of Jubilee” cards, 
    feed the poor, 
    ring the bells, 
    have a reading of these passages and a celebration in your living room, 
    distribute copies of the “Proclamation of Equality” regarding Michael and Mother, 
    gather with believers outdoors, 
    take the day off, 
    pray and meditate, 
    commune with God and the believers, 
    create a new ceremony, 
    write and sing new songs. 

For God's sake, do something to celebrate this great occasion. The rest of the universe—on the capital worlds and the many enlightened planets—already celebrates it as _the_ high holy day. Don't be left out. We, of all peoples, must lead the charge, as it was the events on our planet that made this possible: Michael's seventh and final bestowal. A jubilee is defined as an “anniversary celebration.” 

I hope to hear a word of good cheer from you! Glory to God in the highest! _Gloria in excelsis deo!_ 



> Upon the completion of the Creator Son's seventh and final creature bestowal, the uncertainties of periodic isolation terminate for the Divine Minister, and the Son's universe helper becomes forever settled in surety and control. It is at the enthronement of the Creator Son as a Master Son, at the **jubilee of jubilees** , that the Universe Spirit, before the assembled hosts, first makes public and universal acknowledgment of subordination to the Son, pledging fidelity and obedience. This event occurred in Nebadon at the time of Michael's return to Salvington after the Urantian bestowal. Never before this momentous occasion did the Universe Spirit acknowledge subordination to the Universe Son, and not until after this voluntary relinquishment of power and authority by the Spirit could it be truthfully proclaimed of the Son that “all power in heaven and on earth has been committed to his hand.” [33:3.5] 
> 
> After this pledge of subordination by the Creative Mother Spirit, Michael of Nebadon nobly acknowledged his eternal dependence on his Spirit companion, constituting the Spirit coruler of his universe domains and requiring all their creatures to pledge themselves in loyalty to the Spirit as they had to the Son; and there issued and went forth the final “Proclamation of Equality.” Though he was the sovereign of this local universe, the Son published to the worlds the fact of the Spirit's equality with him in all endowments of personality and attributes of divine character. And this becomes the transcendent pattern for the family organization and government of even the lowly creatures of the worlds of space. This is, in deed and in truth, the high ideal of the family and the human institution of voluntary marriage. [33:3.6] 
> 
> The Son and the Spirit now preside over the universe much as a father and mother watch over, and minister to, their family of sons and daughters. It is not altogether out of place to refer to the Universe Spirit as the creative companion of the Creator Son and to regard the creatures of the realms as their sons and daughters—a grand and glorious family but one of untold responsibilities and endless watchcare. [33:3.7] 
> 
> The Son initiates the creation of certain of the universe children, while the Spirit is solely responsible for bringing into existence the numerous orders of spirit personalities who minister and serve under the direction and guidance of this selfsame Mother Spirit. In the creation of other types of universe personalities, both the Son and the Spirit function together, and in no creative act does the one do aught without the counsel and approval of the other. [33:3.8] 

The Ascension by Catherine Andrews 

---

**_Addendum:_** _The above recital covers the high points that occurred following Michael' ascension from Urantia. In collaboration with scholars from the community the following list of thrilling occurrences is enumerated. I am not privy to the exact time of Michael's enthronement at the jubilee of jubilees, however this timeline suggests or reveals that much, if not all of these events occurred quickly, even over the course of a little more than five hours, from about 7:45 am to about 1:00 pm on May 18, 30 AD. (Salvington has its own time zone—ha.)

1. Jesus' ascension from Mount Olivet, about 7:45 am, May 18, 30 AD [193:5.5]_ 
2. Traveled to Edentia by way of Jerusem, and was returned to status of Paradise sonship [193:5.4] 
3. Formal confirmation by the Universal Father of Michael’s completed sovereignty of the universe of Nebadon [193:5.5] 
4. Enthronement on Salvington, jubilee of jubilees [33:3.5] 
5. Greater and personal revealing of the Universe Mother Spirit [34:2.1] 
6. Proclamation of Equality—Michael and Mother [33:3.6] 
7. Worldwide bestowal of the Spirit of Truth with the accompanying joy, security, and confidence, about 1:00 pm, May 18 [194:0.1,2] 
8. Preparation of all normal minds for the universal bestowal of Thought Adjusters upon the people of earth [194:2.3] 
9. Michael proclaimed Planetary Prince of Urantia, by our Paradise adviser, the Union of Days [114:1.1] at the time of Michael's elevation to sovereignty [23:2.18] 
10. Institution of the Twenty-Four Counselors on Jerusem and arrival of their representative, our first Resident Governor General, concurrent with the outpouring of the Spirit of Truth, May 18, 30 AD [114:6.1] 
11. Arrival of the twelve corps of the master seraphim of planetary supervision [114:6.1) 

_This list is not exhaustive by any means. The reader may do further study to learn about the mighty and concurrent lessening of self-assertiveness of individuals and groups, equality of women and men, power to forgive, internment of rebel midwayers, subsequent organization of the midwayers, and generally inaugurating a new era of joy, security, confidence, power, and love._ 

_A word about Pentecost dates. The Pharisees of Jesus' time, many current day Jews, and Christians count Pentecost as fifty days from the day following the Passover feast. But not so with the Sadducees among whom were counted Annas and the then acting High Priest, Caiaphas—they held to an older and strict interpretation that the fifty-day counting of Omer would begin at the time of the ripening of the barley (cf. Leviticus 23:9- 23). Other feasts generally have a set day, but the festival of the first fruits was oriented flexibly to the agricultural reality of barley harvest time. For this and other reasons, adult males from surrounding areas would often spend a number of weeks in the precincts of Jerusalem to encompass a plurality of required festival attendances. [194:4.1] Therefore it is entirely plausible that May 18, 30 AD was fifty days after the presentation offering in the temple of the first ripe barley harvest and therefore indeed Jerusalem's day of Pentecost at the Shavuot ending of the festival of weeks._

_Glory to God in the highest for the loving watchcare over our little, but prominent planet._

# Mighty Messenger Fall - Introduction Edition

by Jena Lassiter 

## What does The Urantia Book say about...? 

With our Fall Mighty Messenger edition we want articles specifically written for people unfamiliar with The Urantia Book. We hope that this edition will serve as something akin to a “Coffee Table Magazine” for family and friends as an introduction to ideas and values in The Urantia Book , without just leading them directly into the book itself. 

What does this mean for the articles we want you to write for the Mighty Messenger Fall Edition? 

Think about this audience of people unfamiliar with The Urantia Book! 

We want authors to create articles for someone who knows nothing about the book, but is open to “spiritual thinking.” Some members of this audience might be resistant to being talked to about Jesus since so many Christians have approached them to give unsolicited advice about their beliefs. On the other hand, some audience members are dissatisfied Christians who want something more. Some audience members might be oriented to science or astronomy. Some audience members want to hear ideas about what happens after the life experience here. Some want to know about life on other planets. 

Think of times that you may have worked in a booth introducing The Urantia Book or even just talked with friends and acquaintances to introduce them to The Urantia Book. What topics did they want to know about? What did you want to know about when you were first being introduced to The Urantia Book? 

When you write an answer in your mind to “What does The Urantia Book say about... ?” (replace the ellipsis with your topic); try not to just reference quotes from the book. Talk conversationally, from your own understanding and personal experience. The writing style from the 1920s, used in _The Urantia Book_ , can be extremely beneficial when attempting a deep understanding of the book. However, that writing style can be complex and confusing to modern day readers, especially when they are being introduced to _The Urantia Book_ for the first time. If you need to use a quote from _The Urantia Book_ , try to find a way to paraphrase the quote and still communicate the essence of the meaning. 

It is sometimes tough to think that we can communicate any idea better than _The Urantia Book_. Some great advice I’ve received about how to do this translation process from 1920’s writing style to a current, more concise writing style is: 

- Take out some of the adjectives and adverbs. 
- Break apart some of the really long sentences. 

You can always leave a footnote if they want to find the actual quote later. 

We hope that this Mighty Messenger Fall Edition will be an effective life-changing introduction for friends and family for many years to come.
