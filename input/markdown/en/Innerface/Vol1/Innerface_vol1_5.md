# The  Parliament of The World's Religions

Byron Belitsos, OK, USA


For anyone interested in the future of religion, the 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions, held in Chicago last September, was a central event of our times, a jubilee for inter-religious dialogue.  It also marked the centennial of the world-historic 1893 Parliament of World Religion, now recognized as the founding event in the interfaith movement.  The 1993 Parliament heralded a new beginning for the movement for religious unity in a postmodern world.                                       

I attended the Parliament as a member of the press corps, but I was gladly swept up in the spontaneous religious fervor of the event.  It was indeed a watershed in my own religious growth.  My concepts of unity were so deepened, my inspiration from the event was so powerful, that in certain moments the ground on which we stood became sacred, became for me a mythic world center, an axis mundi.  Through this place—the mundane Palmer House Hotel in downtown Chicago—was poured a unifying spirit manifesting itself in a dazzling array of forms of human expression of the divine.

Beauty is a matter of "the harmonic unification of contrasts", and "variety is essential to the concept of beauty" (646).  Because 125 faiths were united there, the Parliament was an epiphany of the beauty of religious unity—albeit a brief experience of sharing crowded into a week in September.

In actuality, religious unity is a distant dream for Urantia.  We have not even achieved peace and non-violence between the religions; it is depressing to realize that many of the 40 or so wars and conflicts in the world today are religiously-motivated.  The war in Bosnia, the Arab-Israeli conflict, and the conflict in Northern Ireland are sad examples of the breakdowns that occur when diverse religions are not in dialogue.  But the eight days of the Parliament last September were an inspiring model of where we are headed.  With a few exceptions, it was marked by unity, tolerance, and loving dialogue between the myriad of faiths represented.

To adequately summarize the events of this historic week is nearly an impossible task. Consider that each day, the 6000 attendees had a choice among: morning and evening interfaith meditation sessions; two plenary sessions; dozens of major presentations in large ballrooms by some of the world's leading religious figures; more than 100 seminars and lectures on every conceivable topic; an extensive video/film festival; special symposiums on religious pluralism, science, business ethics, and media; and numerous artistic events.

Choosing from this rich menu of options was in itself a religious experience!


The Urantia Book and the parliament


It is unfortunate indeed that no organization representing The Urantia Book participated in any of these interfaith activities.  Only one lecture by a Urantia Book reader-believer was given, an impromptu event attended by less than ten people.  This lecture was not listed in the 151-page program booklet for the Parliament, which included over 600 lectures, seminars, and workshops of amazing variety.  Why? The Fellowship of Urantia Book Readers had voted not to join the 125 sponsoring organizations.  It did reverse itself just a few weeks before—but too late to be visible in the Parliament program.  As an afterthought, a committee of the Fellowship did sponsor a strictly promotional booth. The Urantia Foundation, headquartered in Chicago , was completely absent, not even sending an observer of the proceedings. This is shocking when you consider that several thousand representatives of overseas religions flew into Chicago at great expense.

All this is especially puzzling in view of the Book's progressive teachings on religious unity and interfaith dialogue.  On page 1012 we read, "There is not a Urantia religion that could not profitably study and assimilate the best of the truths in every other faith, for they all contain truth."  Might this not also apply to believers in the Urantia revelation?

In the Urmia lectures, Jesus himself advocates that all religions "...completely divest themselves of all ecclesiastical authority and fully surrender all concept of spiritual  sovereignty...." (1487) 1 would therefore ask, do believers in the fifth epochal  revelation lay claim to such authority?  If not in theory, then in action?

Most of the religions represented at the Parliament evolved from what their adherents believe is a textual revelation of some kind of revelatory event. Think of The Koran, the Vedas, the tablets of Baha'ulla that created the Baha'i religion, The Hebrew Bible, The Book of Mormon, or the scriptures resulting from the revelatory event of Jesus, or Buddha's, or Zoroaster's life and teachings. Believers in all these revelations of truth   participated at the Parliament.  What keeps us from dialogue with so many others with whom we share a claim to revelation?

Our absence from the Parliament shows once again how urgent it has become for reader-believers of The Urantia Book to constitute themselves as a bona fide religious movement, a spiritual movement that embodies a mixture of evolutionary and revelatory religion—just like any other religion on Urantia. Anything less is intellectually dishonest and arrogant.  To stand aside from the stream of religious life on this planet, convinced that we possess The Truth is a delusion of grandeur. It is a tragic fallacy to believe that  we have a pure revelation needing protection from contamination through contact with the evolutionary religions of our world. Only fundamentalist or markedly ecclesiocentric  organizations did not participate actively in the Parliament.

In The Urantia Book, revelation is conceived of as a process, not a static product etched in ink and paper.  In much of the text, the revelators resort to pure revelation.  But the text is also studded with more than a thousand of the highest existing human concepts gathered from the early part of this century—a ratio of one concept to every two pages. These concepts are destined to become outdated.  Such is the wisdom of the revelators; the book itself is a mixed evolutionary/revelatory deposit in the evolutionary stream of  planetary history.

The book has not yet entered into the evolutionary stream of this planet, but many of its "concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge" (17) are no longer so advanced.  Some—certainly most of the science—are entirely outdated. Evolving religious experience and theology (not to mention advances in science and philosophy) have left many of these notions behind in dusty shelves in used bookstores. Other features of our "revelation," such as the Book's  use of sexist language are, in my view, completely outdated.                   

For this and other reasons, I believe that Urantia Book readers can profit from dialogue with contemporary religions and theologies, as much as they can from us.  I have personally benefited from study and dialogue with such late-20th century developments as feminist and liberation theology, current discoveries in Christology, new truths emerging from four decades of Buddhist-Christian dialogue, progressive new auto-revelations such as the Baha'i religion, theological reflections on the new physics and biology, and the rapidly emerging methodologies of interfaith dialogue and "global theology."

It is true, of course, that many readers did participate in the Parliament as individuals. Most could be found helping at an advertising booth sponsored by the Urantia Fellowship. More than 70 exhibits were available, manned by a great swirl of traditional religions, modern sects, new religious movements, religious foundations, and publishers.

It is notable that long-time Book reader, Peter Lawrence, executive director of the New York-based interfaith organization known as the Temple of Understanding, represented his organization in the formal meetings of the Assembly of Religious and Spiritual Leaders.  A committee of the Fellowship, but not the Fellowship itself, is also a member of the North American Interfaith Network, which met at the Parliament.


A profile of the parliament


The plenary sessions were the major events of the week. These covered such topics as "Interfaith Understanding",  "What Shall We Do?", "Visions of Paradise", "Voices of the Disposessed", "The Inner Life", and "The Inner Life in the Community."  Deep exchanges of religious thought and feeling occurred in these large forums, and scores of smaller sessions and panels.  Many sessions, such as "What Shall We Do?" and "Voices of the Dispossessed", also provided an unprecedented encounter of the world's religious leaders with the political and ethical issues raised by science and technology, the global environment, and problems of overpopulation, war (including religiously-motivated violence), politics,  media, and economics.

An innovative forum called "The Parliament of the People" provided a vehicle for lay religionists to communicate their concerns about critical global and religious issues to the formal "Assembly of Religious and Spiritual Leaders." The Assembly was comprised of 150 of the most important religious and spiritual leaders in the world.  It met for the last three days of the week at the Art Institute of Chicago, site of the original Parliament.

A "Concert for the 21st Century" was held in Grant Park on the final day.  The closing ceremony (held on the same stage) was keynoted in a speech by the Dalai Iama of Tibet, with 20,000 in attendance.

The Parliament of World Religions was more than an opportunity for interfaith sharing. It also produced some concrete results: foremost was probably the adoption by the Assembly of a common statement, the Declaration of a Global Ethic. It also produced an unprecedented challenge to the religionists of the world in the form of the report to the Parliament of World Religions from the secular/scientific community, the Global 2000 Report Revisited: What Shall We Do? In addition, it witnessed an encounter among specialists and theologians in the "Conference on Pluralism".


Models of interfaith dialogue


Throughout the week, lay people, theologians, and religious leaders grappled with various approaches to interfaith dialogue. All of us, even the proselytizers, were swept up into a vast experience in sharing and listening.

Speaker after speaker advocated that each of us listen openly and graciously to the beliefs of all others, no matter how different or strange.  We were urged to allow the other to share, and allow the other to listen. This reigning philosophy goaded those of us who are used to disguising our religious affiliation—notably Urantia Book readers—to come out of the closet. After 19 years of reading the Book, this was the first religious gathering I have attended where I felt quite uninhibited about sharing my belief in The Urantia Book.

The spirit of the Parliament was one of general openness, but I was able to identify at least four distinct models for interreligious dialogue that seemed to animate the participants: exclusivist, inclusivist, pluralist, and functionalist.


Exclusivism


We all know that many religions have spawned fundamentalist movements which find intolerable the relativism implied in interfaith dialogue.  For example, the Southern Baptist Convention sent no representatives to the Parliament, nor did any of the strains of Islamic fundamentalism. My own mother church, the Eastern Orthodox, surprised many by withdrawing on the third day of the Parliament, on orders from the Patriarch in Istanbul, Turkey. The Orthodox were offended by the presence of several small "neo-pagan", notably WICCA and the eco-feminist group called Covenant of the Goddess.

It was an embarrassment for me to realize that my two religious affiliations, the Greek Orthodox and the Urantian, were not represented at the 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions.

Others of the exclusivist strain were more pragmatic.  There was no shortage of proselytizing organizations who used the Parliament as a platform to promulgate "truth." I personally met many attendees who held forth on the superiority of their tradition over others, or who had considerable difficulty allowing me to share my own peculiar faith.

The exclusivist approach might be described as "exoteric", as opposed to the "esoteric" tendencies that exist within these same traditions.  Generally, exoteric religionists identify as "absolute" some feature of the external form of their religion. A revealed text, a ritualistic practice, or some definition or symbol of God, is seen as superior to all others, in some sense.  To permit relativism would cause an unacceptable insecurity in the faith.

Inclusivism

By contrast with the exoteric, the esoteric's faith is based on a direct mystical or personal experience of the Ultimate.  Symbols and beliefs are experienced as transparent—an expedient way to mediate the encounter with God. "The esoteric finds the Absolute within traditions, as poets find poetry in poems," says Frithjof Schuon, who has elaborated the distinction between exoteric and esoteric in The Transcendental Unity of Religions and elsewhere.

Esoteric believers in any tradition have an obvious basis for dialogue that is grounded in their common mystical experience.  This would imply that there are only two types of religions: the exoteric and the esoteric, and these divergent approaches are to be found in  each tradition.  Schuon says the real divisions in world religion are not between the many religions, but these two very different types of religious persons.

I suppose I am an inclusivist. The Urantia Book seems to endorse this position in the "Second Discourse On Religion," (1732), where we read that "the religion of the spirit requires only unity of experience...only unity of spirit feeling."

The ultimate meaning of the Parliament for me was in the growing sense of the unity of religious experience as the ground for inter-religious dialogue.  A unity of religious feeling was always palpable at the interfaith meditation sessions held each morning and evening.  This sense of unity was especially true of the plenary sessions—grand events with several thousand people often in attendance, some watching by closed-circuit TV in adjoining ballrooms.

The culminating experience of spirit unity for me was the plenary on "The Inner Life," held on the fourth night. Representatives of the major religions spoke—each one a master of the esoteric path within their tradition. As each intoned his or her experience of transcendent realities, the audience seemed to become more still. An unspoken consensus of the unity of spiritual experience hung in the air. I felt this especially in the poignant silences between their presentations, in the dignified demeanor of each representative, and in the ardor of the listening audience.

Pluralism

The meetings of the academics and theologians were concurrent with the popular workshops and lectures. They were open to any lay observers who could fit into the crowded ballrooms.

The academics wrestled with more exacting models for creation of a legitimate basis for interfaith dialogue.  A dominant model among today's theologians is "pluralism." Raimundo Panikkar, a keynote speaker in the Conference on Pluralism, warned that we must be skeptical in our search for a "universal theory" of even that of a common essence of religion.  He and others made clear the danger of a rush to find a "common essence" for, in the process, we might miss what is genuinely different, and therefore what is genuinely challenging in other religions.  Stating in advance what is common may inhibit our ability to really listen, to be simply open.  While rejecting the need to always find common ground, the theologians of pluralism paradoxically hold fast to the value of dialogue, while warning always against the pitfalls of a "radical skepticism."  They try to walk the difficult path between "inclusivism" and total relativism.

Functionalist

I define the functionalist model of interfaith dialogue as the search for broadly common goals and purposes, especially that of uniting all humankind—even non-believer—for the sake of the survival of the planet. Functionalists are pragmatic. They realize how difficult it would be to unite "...the follower of the differing intellectual theologies which so characterize Urantia." (1010)

Functionalists can find considerable support for their approach in The Urantia Book, which preaches that "...Someday religionists will get together and actually effect cooperation on the basis of unity of ideals and purposes rather than attempting to do so on the basis of psychological opinions and theological beliefs." (1019)

This Urantia Book statement is a fair description of the Parliament! The Assembly of Religious and Spiritual Leaders did succeed in unifying around the Declaration of a Global Ethic, which was issued on the final day of the Parliament.  Meeting for three days in the auditorium of the Art Institute of Chicago, the site of the 1893 Parliament, the delegates debated this and many other proposals and, with a few abstentions, approved the document.

The Declaration bases unity on shared ethical principles, not theology. It affirms a broad and common understanding for ethical behavior for all peoples, for norms and standards describing what is acceptable, and unacceptable, across all religious and spiritual traditions. This includes commitments to non-violence, just economics, tolerance, equal rights, and respect for life. It also condemns inequities in the world economy, environmental abuses, media manipulation, sex discrimination, and religious violence. The Assembly also affirmed a process by which the Declaration could take root in the world community, through an ongoing process of debate and discussion in the religious community, aided by scholarly input and critique.

The Declaration was drafted by the noted Swiss theologian Hans Kung, by invitation of the Council of the Parliament. An extended argument for such a world ethic appears in his most recent book, Global Responsibility: In Search of a New Ethic, reviewed in a recent issue of The Spiritual Fellowship Journal.

Let us hope that the many lessons from the 1993 Parliament of the World's Religions come home for Urantia Book readers. Can we envision a day when reader-believers in the fifth epochal revelation lead the way into a new epoch of religious tolerance and interfaith understanding—even world religious unity?

# Apartheid Mandeled

Joanne Scheffler, Gold Coast, Australia


"A miracle unfolded; A Good Man;" These were the words I read as I picked up the newspaper following the election of Nelson Mandela to be president of South Africa.

Having been one of many pessimistic people predicting bloodshed, revolution, general doom and gloom I was more than overwhelmed when none of this happened and I was so privileged to witness a great chapter in social evolution.

As I furiously read the article, tears of joy occasioned my cheek, I wanted to know—How was this possible? One man, they say, is accredited with the peaceful outcome to date. The painful process of unity. Black and white hugging and kissing in the street. White and black politicians working together for the good of all—as though a newly found freedom was given to them, permission to do those things which we inherently know to be right but through culture, beliefs, fear, we do create anger where there could be tolerance, fear where there could be love. As I read on, I almost hear the relief of the people saying thank you for giving us permission to understand, or at least to try to understand, our black, blue, brindle brothers and sisters. It may not be easy but we are prepared to try.

I read on. I want to know how this one man gave this permission. What secrets did he hold? Did he use magic? Was he to be trusted? Why did these people, so many people, unquestioningly respond with such positive, peaceful, fearless courage to do the so-called "impossible."

In descriptions of him, they use words like "caring." He takes time out to  phone the wife of a white journalist killed in a car crash. Listens and gives empathic support for 45 minutes or so and later asks a friend of hers at a rally how she is faring.1

They describe his "bossiness" as beguiling rather than offensive. While addressing a large crowd at an election rally, he notices that a marshall was behaving a bit roughly with an excited boy. He broke off from his speech and said, "No, marshall, stop it! That's no way to treat a child and then gave orders to bring all children to the front out of the crush.

"Kind" and "forgiving" are frequently used.2 He writes not one bad word about his predecessors (his so-called enemies), his jailers.3 "Let bygones be bygones," he says, inviting all these people to celebrate his presidency, and referring to them with kindness, sincerity, and, most of all, genuine forgiveness.

He neither drinks, smokes, nor swears. He expresses anger at a certain group at a rally who were firing shots into the air. He says, "I must take the strongest offence at this behavior of these individuals,"  which provoked fits of giggles from the crowd—also having the desired effect on the offenders. They cease.

He declares at a rally that, "he loves each person there"— the strange thing is that you believe it. He helps reporters carry their heavy equipment, especially that used by a female journalist, to where he himself will be interviewed.4 The list is endless.

So in summary:
A man of great integrity, sincere, honest.
A man of forgiveness, genuine.
A man always happy and smiling.5

Are these how we would describe any of our politicians today, or anyone else for that matter?

I have heard these words before. These and more describe to me the man/god who walked the earth 2000 years ago. He said, "I am the way."

Today we have a great example of how the teachings of Jesus—doing as he would have done—has healed, or has helped to heal, a very volatile situation. What they now do with this, we will see.

Thank you, Nelson Mandela, for showing us, once again, what can be achieved when we do as Jesus would have done. The possibilities are endless. The manual is written. All we have to do is to start acting out the behavior of Jesus instead of just talking and reading about what he did—get out there and show the way!

# Adversity and the Spiritual Value of Disappointment

Ian Stephen, Tewantin, Australia


The Urantia Book tells us that "Jesus talked for more than an hour to the assembled groups on, 'The Mission of adversity and the spiritual value of dis-appointment.'" (1688)

I have been studying The Urantia Book for only a short time, but when I read this passage I felt very aware that it had great significance for me—that I related to it.

I had a conventional upbringing in the Anglican Church but, as so often happens these days, my faith became less relevant to me as I became older. There were spicier, more materialistic pursuits. All quite usual.

I had a successful career as an accountant and my work involved my living overseas in various countries. I led a very enjoyable and successful life. I was healthy and happy, self-contained, and satisfied with myself. Spiritual matters or considerations about the real meaning of life rarely crossed my mind.

Suddenly, in 1972, a black cloud appeared on the horizon! All was not well. My eyesight was deteriorating. In 1973, after two operations, I became blind in the right eye. Between then and 1979 I underwent six operations on the left eye which left me with 30% vision in it—with the assistance of contact lens and spectacles. The prognosis was that I would also lose all sight in this eye.

It would be an understatement to say that these circumstances changed my life. My confidence was shattered, my social life curtailed, and my career ruined. However, as I now write this article, I think "so what!" Looking back, I consider this experience has been the greatest blessing I ever received. Or may I say, "I have experienced the spiritual value of disappointment."

The first positive to occur was that I learned of the wonderful power of other people's prayer working in my life. I did not go blind. I was fortunate in knowing many Christian people, largely among those with whom I worked. So many of these wonderful folk prayed for me at a time when I was unable to do so for myself. I know this is what saved my eyesight. Nothing else could have.

My spiritual progress after that was, I regret to say, very slow. I was recalcitrant and resisted the whole way. God's patience was another blessing I have now come to know. At first, I did not see that the material success that I still craved was not important. Gradually however, as I was able to relinquish my resentment about my mishaps. I started to see my situation from a different standpoint—that is, spiritually.

I never forgot the blessing I received through the prayers of those people, and I started to realise that there is another and more important side to life. Since that time, I have pursued a sometimes hesitant, but nevertheless ongoing spiritual development. This was at first through mainstream Christian church involvement and then later, conjointly with my Urantia Book studies.

I have come to know the great love God has for me. I am learning the reason for my Urantia existence. It is to learn, spiritually, his plan for my salvation. Knowing this, my main purpose in living is to help others also come to this realization.

If my particular "adversity" had not occurred, I would never have found the spiritual path which I now tread. Adversities in this life are many and varied, but I know what Jesus meant for me, and for others, when he talked of "the mission of adversity and the spiritual value of disappointment." 

# It's a Worry

William Wentworth, Towamba, Australia


If there is any single issue which exercises the minds of readers of The Urantia Book, the question of how to attract more readers, or alternatively how to spread the teachings, would have to be given pride of place. We seem to give more attention to this question than to almost any other. Wherever readers gather, at study groups, conferences, or everyday social situations, the conversation usually seems to come around to this question. And although no survey has been attempted, it's a fair bet to say that more words have been written by readers about this topic than any other. Upon all of our minds the question insists on impinging itself. How are we to introduce the Fifth Epochal Revelation to the people of Urantia? How is the population of our planet to become aware of the most advanced information yet made available to us? What can we do to assist people to take to heart  the message of hope which the Revelation contains?

The question worries us. All around us we see evidence of our previous vital and progressive civilization beginning to degenerate and decay. The evil chickens of the secular revolt are coming home to roost. Only a widespread rekindling of interest in spiritual truth and the evolution of worship-wisdom can forestall a "dark age."

It doesn't seem to be happening. The Fifth Epochal Revelation is making very slow progress. Readership grows only very slowly. Spiritual revivals follow older and more spectacular paths. Religions go around in circles. Some readers think that the Fifth Epochal Revelation is in danger of failing because we, who know and accept it, have failed to put enough of the right kind of effort into propaganda or organization, or personal witness, or philanthropy, or militancy, or prayer, or who knows what else. Groups are inspired to attempt new approaches, but seem often to achieve little. And much energy is expended in internecine strife of one kind or another - over dogma, or technique, or style, or personality clashes. We don't seem to be making much of a fist of it.

But then, what did we expect? Someone has recently pointed out the error of confusing hopes with expectations. The Midwayer Commission teaches that "you should not become discouraged by the apparently slow progress of the kingdom idea..." (1863), and reminds us that "the order of progressive evolution is subjected to sudden and unexpected periodical changes."

The Fifth Epochal revelation is not something that can be sold like soap or toothpaste, and it cannot be forced on people against their will. Only a few of us have so far stumbled upon it, and recognized what we had stumbled upon, because we wanted to. (Can you imagine what life would be like without it?) Maybe the "order of progressive evolution" will infuse increasing numbers of people with the desire for that indefinable something, which they will recognize when they find it—just as we did.

A Solitary Messenger from Orvonton points out that "certain abrupt presentations of thought, conclusions and other pictures of mind...are the sudden emergence into consciousness of ideas which have been grouping themselves together in the submerged mental levels...." Maybe there are large numbers of people whose life experience is accumulating unconsciously in this way. On p.1708 we are told that, "Jesus fully understood how men prepare themselves for the decisions of a crisis, and the performance of sudden deeds of courageous choosing between the recurring situations of good and evil." How many people might just be preparing themselves to make a leap of faith in this way?

So, as we worry about our being ineffectual we can also hope that activities beyond our comprehension are preparing the minds and souls of our fellows to receive the message of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. We can hope it, but we would be silly to expect that such activities negate the need for our efforts.

Nevertheless, even for Jesus himself, "everything must await the coming of its time." While we readers of The Urantia Book wait for the time of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, we can be personally thankful for ourselves having been blessed with it, seize whatever opportunities to spread its message which come our way, keep our expectations in check, and live in hope—hope that life experience is preparing the minds of our fellows to seek, and want, what the Revelation has to offer.

# Do We All Have A Soul?

Ron Cyr, U.S.A.



As a reader of The Urantia Book, it seems to me that Urantia is, and has been, what I can call a "genetic cesspool" caused by the Lucifer rebellion and the downfall of the Adamic mission. We are told how this state of affairs emotionally affected Jesus when he was faced with "the sight of these afflicted mortals, men, women, and children, suffering in large measure as a result of the mistakes and misdeeds of his own trusted Sons of universe administration, peculiarly touched the human heart of Jesus and challenged the divine mercy of this benevolent Creator Son." (1632)

We are also told that, after giving a coin to a street beggar, Jesus refused to pause and speak comfortingly to the man. He said : "Why waste words upon one who cannot perceive the meaning of what you say? The Spirit of the Father cannot teach and save one who has no capacity for sonship." (1440) What Jesus meant was that the man was not of normal mind; that he lacked the ability to respond to spirit leading.

Concerning the Thought Adjuster, we are adjured  to rest assured in "the truth of the fact that an actual fragment of the living God resides within the intellect of every normal-minded and morally conscious Urantia mortal." (62) And we are told "all normal-minded creatures...will receive Adjusters as soon as they attain the age of moral responsibility, of spiritual choice. (596)

I am quoting these different sections of the book because the question arises: What happens to human beings who do not have a "normal mind?" My understanding is that if there is no capacity to make a moral choice, then such an individual cannot be indwelt by a Thought Adjuster and consequently cannot develop a soul.

Besides the genetic deficiencies existing in our human stock, we also have the problem of so many women,  themselves on the brink of starvation, giving birth to children who, from the moment of their birth, will have barely sufficient food to survive. The mental defectiveness that occurs in malnourished children is established beyond a shadow of a doubt. This raises the problem that mental imperfection, resulting from chronic malnutrition, may result in minds that cannot receive all seven adjutant mind spirits, a primary requirement for indwelling by a Thought Adjuster.

So, is not Urantia now  facing a situation where millions upon millions of human beings are now coming into this world having no potential for achieving ultimate spiritual reality? And the situation is worsening! Just a thought!

# The Real Gospel

Norm Du Val, Stevensville, MT, USA



What is the gospel? If you were to ask several people you would probably get several different answers. Some will say that the word gospel means "good news," and it does, but that's just a definition. You want to know, what is the good news, and where does it come from.

Some will tell you that the gospel is the story about Jesus, as written by the New Testament writers, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. After all, these stories are often called the "Four Gospels." Others will say that the good news is that God sent his son to earth as a sacrifice to die, and to rise again, in order to atone for the sins of mankind. Still others say that Jesus' death on the cross was a ransom paid by God to redeem mankind from the Devil, and so on.

In the New Testament it says that Jesus and the apostles went from city to city, preaching the gospel of the kingdom of God to the multitudes.

And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every sickness and every disease among the people. (Matt. 9:35)

And it came to pass...that Jesus went throughout every city and village, preaching and showing the glad tidings of the kingdom of God: and the twelve were with him...(Luke, 8:1; also see Matt 4:23; Mark 1:14, Luke 4:43)

We can tell from these two verses that the gospel was something that Jesus actually preached and taught. Thus, the question of where the gospel comes from is answered. It comes from Jesus.

The word gospel means "good news" and "glad tidings," but what exactly was Jesus telling the crowds? What was the message? And has the essence of this message, the actual gospel, the teachings of Jesus, been partly lost to us today, and replaced by another message, another gospel, the teachings about Jesus?

On these preaching tours, Jesus was giving the people very important information (the good news!), and it must have been powerful, positive, and focused on a few specific ideas. The gospel that Jesus taught could only be that information which satisfies our deepest spiritual hopes, needs and desires: to better know our Father in heaven and our relationship with mankind, to be of the Spirit, and to show the fruits of the Spirit, and to have eternal life with God.

We can tell from his teachings that the gospel of Jesus, even what we can call the "religion of Jesus," must have been, and still is, this:

God is your loving spiritual Father and you are all His children, sons and daughters in His family, and if you love God and love one another, you will have eternal life in heaven.

Have you heard the expression, "I got it straight from the horse's mouth?" When people say this, they mean they got some information right from the source, and therefore it is true, correct. It is like a gold miner finding the mother lode. The actual teachings of Jesus are from the true source, the mother lode, from God Himself, as personified by His son.

Here then are the high spiritual teachings of Jesus. These are the truths that Jesus and the apostles were telling the throngs of people who came to hear. The teachings of Jesus, the real gospel. All you need to know.

Jesus teaches about doing the Father's will and entering the kingdom of heaven.

Not every one who says to me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. (Matt. 7:21)

Doing the Father's will is the key to entering the kingdom of heaven. And what is the Father's will? It is simply loving God and loving and serving your brothers and sisters on earth, your brothers and sisters in God's family.

Jesus tells us how we can have eternal life.

And behold, a certain lawyer stood up, and tested him, saying, Master, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? Jesus said to him, What is written in the law? And he answered saying, Thou shall love God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy strength, and with all thy mind; and thy neighbor as thyself. And Jesus said to him, Thou has answered right; do this and thou shall live. (Luke 10: 25-28)

Do this and you will have eternal life! Love God, and love your neighbor. Could it be any clearer or simpler? Jesus knows that loving all of our fellow humans may not be easy for us, but he does expect trend and effort.

Jesus tells us why he came to earth.

And he said unto them, I must preach the kingdom of God to other cities also; for therefore was I sent. (Luke 4:43)

People have differing views as to the purpose of Jesus' incarnation on earth. Here, Jesus himself tells us. He came to preach the gospel, the good news of the kingdom of God.

Jesus teaches a new and very personal idea about the kingdom of God.

And when he was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God will come not with observation: Neither shall they say, Lo here! or lo, there! for behold, the kingdom of God is within you. (Luke 17:21)

Imagine! The kingdom of God is within you. This is a stunning but misunderstood teaching of Jesus. There are several aspects of the kingdom of God. One is the spiritual: the kingdom is not a material realm. Another is the outward kingdom: the Father and His angels off in heaven somewhere. And then there is the kingdom within. Jesus is talking about this inner kingdom when he says that the kingdom of God is within you, actually a part, or fragment of the Father himself, sharing your life, going through all your ups and downs with you, and if you desire it, guiding you like a compass back to the Father. This is not a nebulous spirituality, wafting through you, as might be imagined for a spirit being, and as might be the case in some situations, but rather a definite focalization of the Father, in you.

If we have become separated from God, Jesus tells us what the Father requires in order for us to come home to Him, to rejoin His family, our spiritual family.

The Parable of the Prodigal Son. (Luke 15:11-32)

Many people do not give much thought to the parables that Jesus taught. They are often quoted, and seldom explained. But parables are simple stories with a single, clear message. You don't have to be a theologian or a rocket scientist to understand them. In this parable, Jesus says that our spiritual Father will welcome us home as soon as we sincerely want to return to Him. In the story, even though the repentant son was still a long way off, when his father saw him coming down the road, he ran to greet him in love and welcome him back into the family. This is how our Father in heaven responds to us, His children, always with an attitude of love and forgiveness. No matter how far down the road away from the Father you think you are, if you want to return home, the door is open.

Jesus tells us how we can have our sins forgiven.

For if you forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. (Matt. 6:14)

Forgiving others is a difficult thing for us to do. In reality, the Father's forgiveness is always there, available to us. By forgiving others, we tap into that forgiveness, we open the door to it.

In a conversation with a man named Nicodemus, Jesus teaches about being "born again."

Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born of water (physical birth), and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. (John 3:5)

God is spirit. When you love God and desire to do His will, you are born again, born of the Spirit. It's that simple.

Jesus tells us to be perfect.

Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father who is in heaven is perfect. (Matt. 5:48)

Nobody's perfect, as the saying goes. Perfection is not our condition, but it is our goal. The Father knows that we have been created with a "human nature," after all, it was He who created us. It will take effort on our part to become more perfect, more spritual, more like God. There is no time like the present to start. In the words of Lao-tzu, "A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step."

Jesus tells us about God's family.

Jesus says, "Our Father..." (Matt 6:9; Luke 11:2)

When Jesus uses the term Father, he is talking about his father and our Father. God is a loving father above all else and we are his children. If we know that we are a son or daughter of God, we will naturally want to act like one.
	Jesus tells us that God knows what we need.


For your Father knows what things you have need of, before you ask Him. (Matt. 6:8)


God knows our real needs. The kingdom of God is a spiritual kingdom and our real needs are mostly spiritual in nature. Therefore, when one prays, one should not pray overmuch for material things, but should pray for spiritual insight, pray for others, pray for help to know and do the Father's will. When Jesus says, "Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and you shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you..." (Matt.7:7; Luke 11:9), he is talking about spiritual gifts, spiritual truths, and spiritual doors.

Jesus teaches about tolerance, one of the fruits of the Spirit, and beyond tolerance, even love for other people and groups which may be different from our own.

For if you only love those who love you, what reward have you? do not even the publicans do the same? And if you salute your brethren only, what do you do more than others? do not even the publicans do so? (Matt. 5:46-47; Luke 6:32-33)

Jesus talks about sharing the good news, the teachings of Jesus.
...freely you have received, freely give. (Matt. 10:8)

The good news is not something to be hidden under a rock. It is to be shared with everyone in God's family.

Many religions are complex, but the real gospel of Jesus is simple: Love God your Father, and love your fellow man. If you do this you will be doing the Father's will, and you will gain eternal life. This gospel of Jesus will also be acceptable to all of God's children on earth who love him, whether they be Christian, Moslem, Jew, Buddhist, or Hindu.

And finally, as would be expected from the Son of a loving God, comforting words from Jesus to all of us. (below)

# More about Secondary Works

Elizabeth Mitchell, Sunshine Coast, Australia



The first issue of Innerface contained an article from the Sunshine Coast Study Group citing references from The Urantia Book indicating that the revelators had the expectation of secondary works becoming a major means of disseminating its message. One of these eagerly anticipated the time when "the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the churches that bear his name". (2090)

One of our editors, Ken Glasziou, has joined in with the endeavors of other creators of secondary works who are attempting to get the ball rolling. Ken has written a fictional adventure story in order to portray the progressive evolution in Jesus' mind of his revolutionary concepts concerning the true nature of Yahweh, the traditional God of his people. The story is not aimed at Urantia Book readers but rather at introducing mainstream Christianity to a vital part of the message contained in the book.

At the time of Jesus, the prevailing Jewish view was about a God who kept his people in line by rewarding righteousness and punishing divergence therefrom. For such as the Pharisees, righteousness had come to mean upholding the 613 rules of the Torah, many of which were concerned with tithing, with rules about keeping the Sabbath, and with what was, and what was not "unclean." Health and wealth were accepted as signs of finding favor with Yahweh. Misfortune was due to the anger of Yahweh, not necessarily due to one's own sins, but possibly the sins of  associates. Yahweh was one who sometimes punished the whole nation for the sins of a single individual. Belief in a life after death was a view not widely held. Yahweh was not so much a God of the individual as a racial God. Such was the conventional wisdom of the social world into which Jesus of Nazareth was born. Unfortunately, it also contaminated the new gospel of the Fourth Epochal Revelation.

The story of the life of Jesus in Part 4 of The Urantia Book describes the emergence into the consciousness of the child Jesus, a vision of God as a loving heavenly Father with whom he could commune on a personal basis. It tells us that Jesus conceived the central purpose of his earthly life was to do the will of his Father. He saw the Father as being holy, just, and great, true, beautiful, and good, and these attributes of God he saw as being the will of God for him. (2087)

One modern day theologian has commented that, for Jesus, reality was a gracious and compassionate God. Add to that the concept of a loving Father whose spirit indwells his earthly children and we have a prescription for "recovering the Son of Man from the tomb of traditional theology and presenting the living Jesus to the churches." The manner advocated in The Urantia Book for achieving such an end is to refrain from taking something out of the hearts of those who seek salvation, but rather to labor to put something in. (1592) This requires the positive method of not attacking perceived error but permitting truth to displace error. "You are not to attack the old ways; you are skillfully to put the leaven of new truth in the midst of the old beliefs. Let the Spirit of Truth do his own work." (1932)

Ken has followed these criteria in his book. To comply with publishers' criteria concerning copyright, he had to avoid using direct quotations that are original to The Urantia Book. Wherever possible, his story uses relevant biblical material that would be familiar to church-going Christians. The central theme of the book is the evolution of  Jesus' concepts about the nature of the heavenly Father, as it unfolds during incidents of his early life. The travels of Jesus as described in this book, parallel, but are not the same as, those described in The Urantia Book. The incidents used to illustrate the theme also differ. They are presented as an effort by Jesus to create a  population  in cities throughout the Mediterranean likely to be receptive to the later missionary endeavors of Paul. The story includes some adventurous escapades with horse thieves and pirates in order to promote reader interest.

People who have read the book rate it as having a reasonable chance of generating a market among mainstream Christians. However to do this, it is going to need your support. Many who have attempted secondary works have had the same experience as did Ken. About twenty different publishing houses were approached with an outline of the book. Not one would even read the manuscript. Less than half replied at all. For those that did reply, the book plan was too radical for two or three, for others, it might have had more chance if it included some of the hocus pocus of the "New Age." Most stated in a obviously standard reply that their publication plans were already completed for some time into the future.

In Ken's years as a research scientist, he contributed chapters to several specialist text books that were organized by entrepreneurial editors. Because of this, he knew about a publishing house, Vantage Press,  that undertook subsidized publication of books in the field of science. A current advertisement by Vantage Press in Scientific American stimulated an inquiry about their system. At the present time, getting a book printed is the least difficult one of those steps required to get books into the distribution network, a process that is becoming more and more tied up to the major publishing houses.  It appears that Vantage Press has at least some access to the distribution system and also publishes material of a general nature. Having no other options open, Ken took the plunge and contracted for "subsidized publication" of his book. This means that he pays for most of the risk, to the tune of US$10,875.00.
This is not a vanity press job. Ken already has more than fifty publications to his credit. If it works out, it may be an opportunity for Urantia Book readers to do something in this urgently needed field of secondary works related to the teachings of the book. It is not easy to get a book published and sold in the bookstores. But up front, money speaks. Ken has committed all royalties from his book to go into a non-profit trust dedicated to promoting secondary works relevant to Urantia Book teachings. Each book sold will yield $5.58 for the fund. The book will be going to press in a few weeks time, and should be available by the time this issue of Innerface is distributed. It should retail for US$13.95

To sell books at the present time, promotion is needed. There is a snowballing effect associated with book sales. Urantia Book readers can help get this project going by asking for, or about, the book at their local bookstores. Discounted books will also be offered by the publisher to any organization likely to assist. Ken has written to study group leaders in the USA asking for their help. This could be the start of something worth while. So please help! Remember the old adage—the Lord helps those who help themselves. If readers get themselves involved, things can be done in this area. Skill, talent, and dedication are not enough. Money is a key requirement. If it really gets going, then maybe we can start thinking about where the future may really lie for spreading the message of our Revelation—the field of audiovisual presentation.

Remember, the name of the book is:

"Christ or Chaos. The Evolution of a Revelation." by K.T. Glasziou (1994, Vantage Press, N.Y.)

# Better Communication with My Thought Adjuster

Author: **Ann Bendall**


My Thought Adjuster can vouch for the fact that I have attempted every naive and simple way to chat with Him. In a prior article I mentioned some of my unbalanced, demanding, insane, and decidedly desperate efforts to have Him talk to me. If I choose to be honest with myself, they all failed!

It appears that  there is no technique left but to try the "well-balanced and sane" (2097) way,  Darn!

It was all so easy when  I thought that all I had to do was whistle through the day chanting in parrot-like fashion, "It is my will that Your will be done", and Voila! no more Cecilia Ann's will in my life, only God's. Introspection at the end of each day, whilst surveying the chaos, revealed the obvious— that the day had been a day of Cecilia Ann's will reigning supreme; i.e., very little God-like will displayed in the day's doings!  I  appreciated that quite possibly it took a little time for God's will to get through. Probably something to do with my being two brained and electro-chemical. But I have such faith in God, and  I  knew that He was fully aware that, in my heart and soul, I truly wanted His will to reign supreme in my life. He was probably putting me to the test, to see if I would change my mind.

I was aiming for perfection of will because I had already put in an order for a mind exchange to Jesus' type of mind. It said it in the book! I could exchange my mind for the mind of Jesus! I considered  my mind to be a good mind, it had served me well for quite a number of years. I also knew, because the Blue book told me, that Jesus had a standard, ordinary Urantia type mind, just like my mind. So, one part of the book assures me that my mind is fine, just the same as Jesus' mind, another part  recommends I exchange mine for his. If both our minds are the same I found it puzzling why I should have a mind-exchange, but anything was worth a try!

So I was praying for God's will and Jesus mind. I realize that this left my body and personality, but seeing there was only a little bit of will attached to personality, I felt the universe and I were safe with those two bits of me remaining. Admittedly, if anywhere in The Urantia Book it was suggested that I could swap my personality for that of a Melchizadek, and my body for a Material daughter, requests for same would have been included in my prayers. As you can gather, I was decidedly dissatisfied with my performance as a child of God. Something needed eradicating or exchanging.

And so I prayed and prayed, and each day the same mind and the same will! So back to the Book! In true scientific fashion, I was going to discover how to get better communication with my Thought Adjuster! And it is amazing! When I remove all my misconceptions and preconceptions from my intellect,  The Urantia Book makes so much more sense.

Of course I can exchange my mind for the mind of Jesus! All I have to do is start using it the same way as he did. I look to Jesus, and at Jesus. What a man! What brilliant usage of a mind just like mine. How he worked his dear mind from childhood, trying so hard to love and understand God; trying so hard to love and understand his family, friends, culture. He could sort out illusion, from fact, from reality, when he was a mere child!

Now I know how I can have better communication with my Thought Adjuster. All I have to do is learn to think, feel and be as God would be if He were I, in my time and place. The secret to better communication with my Thought Adjuster lies in my starting to talk the same language as God; to base my thoughts, beliefs and attitudes to myself and others, and the relationship between us, in accordance with the truths of the universe.  Oh for the days of blissful and frustrating ignorance! Now to the grindstone of growth. The only way my Thought Adjuster can commune with me is if I get the garden of my mind, heart and soul conducive to a visit. God stands patiently and long suffering within, awaiting my horticultural undertaking.

God could not answer my prayer that His will be done in my life for, as I envisaged the process, He was going to make all the decisions! I was so pleased about this. I know that I have a real talent for decision making. I had been a decision maker from way back and had, in my opinion, and the opinion of many around me, an unbroken track record for terrible, disastrous and resoundingly WRONG decisions. With God at the helm making all my decisions, the pathway to Paradise would be a delight. All we had to do was expunge my will totally, so that there was only one will in my life, God's. I would wander through world after world with God's will reigning supreme and me going along for the ride.

It was a lovely dream, but as I deliberate, the reality is much more beautiful. I have no doubt there will be many tears God and I will shed over my will-perfecting exercises. It is going to be a long process, "the consecration and dedication of my (his- Jesus) own will to the majestic service of doing the divine will."(2088)
but I have the utmost of faith in God and Jesus.

All that is decidedly mine is my will. That is the way God wants it. It is the only gift of value that I can give God. However, unlike my naive beliefs, the giving is not a process of saying, "Gee thanks dear Dad for will. It was really nice of you to give it to me but I don't want it so here it is as a present!" He wants me to so value His gift that I utilize it in the same way as He would, that is the process of gift giving!

For eternity, my will will always be mine, and it is by my decisions that this self same will will be executed in a manner that I verily believe would be pleasing to our Father. One day my will will look so much like God's will for me that no one, not even Jesus Michael, will be able to tell the difference. I so much want unbroken communion with my Thought Adjuster just like Jesus had.  And I know I can as long as I do what he did, work and work and work on me!

Jesus did not communicate with God—he communed with him. (Communicate: the imparting or exchange of information, ideas or feelings; Communion: possessing or sharing in common).  How? Because they were like minds, kindred spirits. The mechanism was there at the birth of Jesus. He learnt how to utilize it well, so as to become a friend of God, a kindred spirit. And I have him as my model to learn the technique. So I am going to work on my alter ego ideal and develop a relationship with God, as a real person in my mind. I know that I will create God's personality in human likeness. I also know, because God so wants to develop a relationship with me, that my Thought Adjuster will work in the unseen reaches of my mind to help me to develop a more realistic image of God, as He is not as I want Him to be. "Only personalities can commune with each other, albeit this personal communion may be greatly facilitated by the presence of just such an impersonal entity as the Thought Adjuster." (31)

By getting to know God and Jesus, and then exercising my will in a manner which befits a child of God, one day, "the Spirit (will) bears witness with your spirit (the Adjuster) that you are a child of God. Already has your own Thought Adjuster told you of your kinship to God so that the record testifies that the Spirit bears witness "with your spirit," not to your spirit."(381) What a party we will have that day!

# Science and The Urantia Book. The Mesotron

Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Australia

1. "The charged protons and the uncharged neutrons of the nucleus of the atom are held together by the reciprocating function of the mesotron, a particle of matter 180 times as heavy as the electron. Without this arrangement the electric charge carried by the protons would be disruptive of the atomic nucleus.

2. "As atoms are constituted, neither electric nor gravitational forces could hold the nucleus together. The integrity of the nucleus is maintained by the reciprocal cohering function of the mesotron, which is able to hold charged and uncharged particles together because of superior force-mass power and by the further function of causing protons and neutrons constantly to change places. The mesotron causes the electric charge of the nuclear particles to be incessantly tossed back and forth between protons and neutrons. At one infinitesimal part of a second a given nuclear particle is a charged proton and the next an uncharged neutron. And these alternations of energy status are so unbelievably rapid that the electric charge is deprived of all opportunity to function as a disruptive influence. Thus does the mesotron function as an "energy-carrier" particle which mightily contributes to the nuclear stability of the atom.

3. "The presence and function of the mesotron also explains another atomic riddle. When atoms perform radioactively, they emit far more energy than would be expected. This excess of radiation is derived from the breaking up of the mesotron "energy carrier," which thereby becomes a mere electron. The mesotronic disintegration is also accompanied by the emission of certain small uncharged particles.

4. "The mesotron explains certain cohesive properties of the atomic nucleus, but it does not account for the cohesion of proton to proton nor for the adhesion of neutron to neutron. The paradoxical and  powerful force of atomic cohesive integrity is a form of energy as yet undiscovered on Urantia." (479)

For me, this is one of the truly remarkable passages on science from a Urantia Paper said to have been written in 1934. I first read it in the early 1970's and recognized paragraphs 1 and 2 as the basic postulates of a theory for which Hideki Yukawa was awarded the Nobel prize in 1948. From the 1950's to the 1970's, particle physics was in a state of confusion because of the multitudes of sub-atomic particles that came spewing forth from particle accelerators. As new concepts and discoveries were announced, I kept noting them in the margins of page 479, which eventually became somewhat messy. At times I felt that there was not much that was right on this page, at other times I marvelled at its accuracy.

In recent years, a considerable amount of information has been forthcoming on the history of development of the present "standard model" for atomic structure. Though recognized as being incomplete, the standard model has enormously increased our understanding of the basic nature of matter. The electromagnetic force and the weak force of radiocactive decay have been successfully unified to  yield the "electroweak" theory. As yet this has not been unified with the theory of the "strong" force that holds the atomic nucleus together. The force of gravity remains intractable to unification with the others.

Para's 1-3 above from The Urantia Book, ostensibly presented in 1934, could have come directly from the mind of Hideki Yukawa. In the quantum theory of electromagnetism, two charged particles interact when one emits a photon and the other absorbs it. In 1932 Yukawa had decided to attempt a similar approach to describe the nuclear force field. He wrote, "...it seemed likely that the nuclear force was a third fundamental force, unrelated to gravitation or electromagnetism...which could also find expression as a field...Then if one visualizes the force field as a game of 'catch' between protons and neutrons, the crux of the problem would be to find the nature of the 'ball' or particle." This work was published in Japanese in 1935, but was not well known in the U.S.A.

At first, Yukawa followed the work of Heisenberg and used a field of electrons to supply the nuclear force between protons and neutrons. This led to problems. In 1934 he decided "to look no longer among the known particles for the particle of the nuclear force field. He wrote: "The crucial point came one night in October. The nuclear force is effective at extremely small distances, on the order of 0.02 trillionth of a centimeter. My new insight was the realization that this distance and the mass of the new particle I was seeking are inversely related to each other." He realized he could make the range of the nuclear force correct if he allowed the ball in the game of 'catch' to be heavy— approximately 200 times heavier than the electron."

Para. 3 above extends Fermi's 1934 theory of radio-active decay of the neutron. In his early work, Yukawa had considered that his mesotron might act as the 'ball' in the 'catch' game during radioactive decay.  After re-running his calculations, in 1938 he published a paper predicting the properties of such a mesotron which he now called a 'weak' photon, from which it became known as the 'W' particle.

Para's 1-3 come close to being the contemporary, but incredibly speculative, science of 1934. They include three unknown particles—the pion mesotron (found 1947), the W particle mesotron (found 1983), and the small uncharged particles (neutrinos found 1953). Few would have bet on these predictions being right.
Para 2. comments, "the alternations of energy status are unbelievably rapid..." According to Nobel prize winner, Steven Weinberg, they occur in the order of a million, million, million, millionth of a second. In contrast, the process described in para. 3 takes about a hundredth of a second.

Para. 4 states that  the mesotron (pion) does not account for certain cohesive properties of the atomic nucleus. It then tells us that there is an aspect of this force that is as yet undiscovered on Urantia.

Leon Lederman was a young research worker in 1950 who later became director of the Fermi Laboratory. He was awarded the Nobel prize in 1988. In his book, The God Particle, he comments: "The hot particle of 1950 was the pion or pi meson, as it is also called. The pion had been predicted in 1936 by a Japanese theoretical physicist, Hideki Yukawa. It was thought to be the key to the strong force, which in those days was the big mystery. Today we think of the strong force in terms of gluons. But back then (i.e. 1950's), pions which fly back and forth between the protons to hold them together tightly in the nucleus were the key, and we needed to make and study them."

This force, unknown in 1934, (and for that matter in 1955 when The Urantia Book was published) is now known as the color force. Writing about it in their book, The Particle Explosion, Close, Marten, and Sutton state, "Back in the 1940's and 1950's, theorists thought that pions were the transmitters of the strong force. But experiments later showed that pions and other hadrons are composite particles, built from quarks, and the theory of the strong force had to be revised completely. We now believe that it is the color within the proton and the neutron that attracts them to each other to build nuclei. This process may have similarities to the way that electrical charge within atoms manages to build up complex molecules. Just as electrons are exchanged between atoms bound within a molecule, so are quarks and anti-quarks—in clusters we call 'pions'—exchanged between the protons and neutrons in a nucleus."

The mandate to the revelators permitted "the supplying of information which will fill in vital missing gaps in otherwise earned knowledge." (1110) Whether any physicist ever effectively utilized the information in para. 4 of page 479, we will probably never know. But there are "more things on heaven and earth"... For example, "Physics, it is hoped, will one day reach the ultimate level of nature in which everything can be described and from which the entire universe develops. This belief could be called the quest for the ultimon." (from E David Peat, 1988, Superstrings and the Search for the Theory of Everything.) There is a curious coincidence here. The particle The Urantia Book called a mesotron became shortened to meson. It calls the basic building block of matter an ultimaton. Will it one day be called the ultimon?
