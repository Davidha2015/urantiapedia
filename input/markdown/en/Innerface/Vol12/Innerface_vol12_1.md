# Personality, Identity, Mind, and Consciousness,  in the Urantia Revelation.

Summary

Personality is the most important feature of our being. Firstly it is a unique and unchangeable gift of God. Also it is the meaning of the whole living and functioning creature--for it unifies all factors of reality, co-ordinates their relationships, and imparts the qualities of our identity and creativity. (1227)

In this article, we attempt an in-depth study of what the Urantia Revelation tells us about ourselves, our minds, our personality, identity, and consciousness. Our starting point:

From where do we derive our minds?


# Cosmic Mind

Cosmic mind at its origin is a manifestation of the mind of the third person of the Trinity, the Infinite Spirit. It comes to us indirectly via the Seven Master Spirits of Paradise, and directly from the Creative Spirit of our local universe,  along with her team of helpers, the Adjutant Mind Spirits. These are comprised of the adjutants of : intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, counsel, worship, and wisdom.

There exists in all personality associations of  cosmic mind a quality which might be denominated a "reality response." And it is this reality endowment of will creatures which saves them from becoming helpless victims of the a priori assumptions of science, philosophy, and religion.

The cosmic mind unfailingly responds on three levels of universe reality:

Causation--the reality domain of the physical senses, the scientific realms of logical uniformity, the differentiation of the factual and the nonfactual. This is the mathematical form of cosmic discrimination.
Duty--the reality domain of morals, the recognition of relative right and wrong. This is the judicial form of cosmic discrimination.
Worship--the spiritual domain of religious experience. This includes recognition of divine fellowship, spirit values, eternal survival, and  ascent from the status of servants of God to the joy and liberty of the children of God. This is the highest insight of the cosmic mind--the reverential and worshipful form of cosmic discrimination.

These scientific, moral, and spiritual insights, are innate components of the cosmic mind which endows all will creatures. The experience of living never fails to develop these three cosmic intuitions; they are constitutive in the self-consciousness of all free-will creatures.

In the local universe mind bestowals, these three insights of the cosmic mind are what make it possible for mankind to function as rational and self-conscious personalities.

These same three basic factors in reflective thinking may be unified and co-ordinated in personality development, or they may become disproportionate and unrelated in their respective functions. When they become unified, it is these three cosmic intuitions that provide objective reality for mankind's experience in and with things, meanings, and values.

# Identity and Personality

Mortal identity is a temporary life-time condition that becomes permanent provided only that its accompanying personality elects to become a continuing universe phenomenon, an entity in eternity.

Personality is that quality in reality bestowed by the Universal Father. While itself devoid of identity, personality can unify the identity of any living energy system.

Personality is unique, both in space-time and in eternity. It is changeless--there are no duplicates, no copies. It can be added to spirit, is uniquely conscious of time, and manifests both self-consciousness and free will.

During earthly life the material self has both personality and identity, and is indwelt by the Spirit of God. After death the material body returns to whence it came, eventually becoming dust. However two non-material factors of the surviving personality persist. One is the memory transcript of the mortal career--which is in the keeping of its personal God-Spirit fragment. The other, the immortal soul, is in the custody of the Destiny Guardian.

Both the soul and the memory transcript are essential for re-personalization. It is the reunion of the formerly indwelling God-Spirit fragment with the soul that reassembles the surviving personality and 're-consciousness-izes' the individual at the time of survivor awakening.


Morals, Virtue, and Personality

Intelligence alone does not explain the moral nature. Morality and virtue, are indigenous to human personality. Moral intuition, the realization of duty, is indigenous to the human mind which carries these intrinsic concomitants of cosmic mind. It is also associated with the other inalienables of human nature, such as scientific curiosity and spiritual insight.

Mankind's mentality far transcends that of its animal cousins, but it is a moral and religious nature that especially distinguishes man from the animal world.

The selective response of an animal is limited to the motor level of behavior. The apparent insight of higher animals is really only on a motor level--usually appearing after trial and error experiences.

Mankind, however, is able to exercise scientific, moral, and spiritual insight prior to all exploration or experimentation.

Only a personality can know what it is doing before it does it; only personalities possess insight in advance of experience. A personality can look before it leaps and can therefore learn from looking as well as from leaping. A non-personal animal ordinarily learns only by leaping.

When men and women fail to discriminate the ends of their mortal striving, they find themselves functioning on the animal level of existence. They have failed to avail themselves of the superior advantages of that material acumen, moral discrimination, and spiritual insight which are an integral part of their cosmic-mind endowment as personal beings.

Virtue is righteousness--conformity with the cosmos. To name virtues is not to define them, but to live them is to know them. Virtue is not mere knowledge nor yet wisdom but rather the reality of progressive experience in the attainment of ascending levels of cosmic achievement. In the day-by-day life of mortal mankind, virtue is realized as the consistent choosing of good rather than evil--and such choosing ability is evidence for the possession of a moral nature.

Choosing between good and evil is influenced, not only by the keenness of a moral nature, but also by such influences as ignorance, immaturity, and delusion. A sense of proportion is a necessity in the exercise of virtue, otherwise evil may be perpetrated when the lesser is chosen in the place of the greater as a result of distortion or deception.

Mankind's moral nature would be impotent without the art of measurement, the discrimination that is embodied in the ability to scrutinize meanings. Likewise would moral choosing be futile without that cosmic insight which yields the consciousness of spiritual values. Mankind ascends to the level of a moral being because of its endowment of personality.

Morality can never be advanced by law or by force. It is a personal and freewill matter and must be disseminated by the contagion of the contact of morally fragrant persons with those who are less morally responsive, but who are also in some measure desirous of doing the will of God.

Moral acts are those human performances which are characterized by high intelligence, directed by selective discrimination in the choice of superior ends and the selection of moral means to attain these ends. Such conduct is virtuous.

Supreme virtue, then, is wholeheartedly to choose to do the will of the Father in heaven.

# Urantia Personality

The Universal Father bestows personality upon numerous orders of beings as they function on diverse levels of universe actuality. Urantia human beings are endowed with personality of the finite-mortal type, functioning on the level of the ascending sons of God.

Personality is a unique endowment of original nature, the existence of which is independent of, and antecedent to, the bestowal of the indwelling Spirit-of-God--nevertheless, the presence of this spirit reality does augment the qualitative manifestation of personality.

Personalities may be similar, but they are never the same. Personality is that feature of an individual which we can know--and which enables us to identify such a being at any future time regardless of the nature and extent of all changes in form, mind, or spirit status undergone by that personality.

Creature personality is distinguished by two self-manifesting and characteristic phenomena of reactive behavior--self-consciousness and associated relative free will.

Self-consciousness is the intellectual awareness of personality actuality. It indicates capacity for individualized experience in and with cosmic realities--the attainment of identity status in the personality relationships of the universe.

The relative free will which characterizes the self-consciousness of human personality is involved in:

Moral decision making, highest wisdom.
Spiritual choice, truth discernment.
Unselfish love, brotherhood service.
Purposeful co-operation, group loyalty.
Cosmic insight, the grasp of universe meanings.
Personality dedication, wholehearted devotion to doing the Father's will.
Worship, the sincere pursuit of divine values and the wholehearted love of the divine Value-Giver.

The bestowal of the divine gift of personality upon such a mind-endowed mortal mechanism confers the dignity of cosmic citizenship and enables such a mortal creature forthwith to become reactive to the constitutive recognition of the three basic mind realities of the cosmos:

The mathematical or logical recognition of the uniformity of physical causation.
The reasoned recognition of the obligation of moral conduct.
The faith-grasp of the fellowship worship of Deity, associated with the loving service of humanity.

The full function of such a personality endowment is the beginning realization of Deity kinship. Such a selfhood, indwelt by a pre-personal fragment of God the Father, is in truth and in fact a spiritual son of God.

# Life as Process

Physical life is a process taking place not so much within the organism as between the organism and the environment. And every such process tends to create and establish organismal patterns of reaction to such an environment. And all such directive patterns are highly influential in goal choosing.

It is through the mediation of mind that the self and the environment establish meaningful contact. The ability and willingness of the organism to make such significant contacts with environment (response to a drive) represents the attitude of the whole personality.

Persons cannot very well perform in isolation. Man is innately a social creature; he is dominated by the craving of belongingness. It is literally true, "No man lives unto himself."

But the concept of the personality as the meaning of the whole of the living and functioning creature means much more than the integration of relationships; it signifies the unification of all factors of reality as well as co-ordination of relationships.

Relationships exist between two objects, but three or more objects eventuate a system, and such a system is much more than just an enlarged or complex relationship. This distinction is vital, for in a cosmic system the individual members are not connected with each other except in relation to the whole and through the individuality of the whole.

In the human organism the summation of its parts constitutes selfhood--individuality--but such a process has nothing to do with personality, which is the unifier of all these factors as related to cosmic realities.

In the human system it is the personality which unifies all activities and in turn imparts the qualities of identity and creativity.

# The Self

In all concepts of selfhood it should be recognized that the fact of life comes first, its evaluation or interpretation later. The human child first lives and subsequently thinks about his living. In the cosmic economy insight precedes foresight.

The possession of personality identifies man as a spiritual being since the unity of selfhood and the self-consciousness of personality are endowments of the super-material world.

As mind pursues reality to its ultimate analysis, matter vanishes to the material senses but may still remain real to mind. When spiritual insight pursues that reality which remains after the disappearance of matter and pursues it to an ultimate analysis, it vanishes to mind, but the insight of spirit can still perceive cosmic realities and supreme values of a spiritual nature. Accordingly does science give way to philosophy, while philosophy must surrender to the conclusions inherent in genuine spiritual experience. Thinking surrenders to wisdom, and wisdom is lost in enlightened and reflective worship.

In science the human self observes the material world; philosophy is the observation of this observation of the material world; religion, true spiritual experience, is the experiential realization of the cosmic reality of the observation of the observation of all this relative synthesis of the energy materials of time and space. To build a philosophy of the universe on an exclusive materialism is to ignore the fact that all things material are initially conceived as real in the experience of human consciousness. The observer cannot be the thing observed; evaluation demands some degree of transcendence of the thing which is evaluated.

In time, thinking leads to wisdom and wisdom leads to worship; in eternity, worship leads to wisdom, and wisdom eventuates in the finality of thought.

The possibility of the unification of the evolving self is inherent in the qualities of its constitutive factors: the basic energies, the master tissues, the fundamental chemical over-control, the supreme ideas, the supreme motives, the supreme goals, and the indwelling divine spirit of the Father bestowal--the secret of the self-consciousness of man's spiritual nature.

The material self, the ego-entity of human identity, is dependent during the physical life on the continuing function of the material life vehicle, on the continued existence of the unbalanced equilibrium of energies and intellect which, on this planet, has been given the name life.

But selfhood of survival value, selfhood that can transcend the experience of death, is only evolved by establishing a potential transfer of the seat of the identity of the evolving personality from the transient life vehicle--the material body--to the more enduring and immortal nature of the soul and on beyond to those levels whereon the soul becomes infused with, and eventually attains the status of, spirit reality.

This actual transfer from material association is effected by the sincerity, persistence, and steadfastness of the God-seeking decisions of the human creature.

# The Reality of Human Consciousness

Creature personality is distinguished by two self-manifesting and characteristic phenomena of mortal reactive behavior: self-consciousness and associated relative free will.

Self-consciousness consists in intellectual awareness of personality actuality; it includes the ability to recognize the reality of other personalities. It indicates capacity for individualized experience in and with cosmic realities, equivalating to the attainment of identity status in the personality relationships of the universe. Self-consciousness connotes recognition of the actuality of mind ministration and the realization of relative independence of creative and determinative free will.

The relative free will which characterizes the self-consciousness of human personality is involved in:

1. Moral decision, highest wisdom.
2. Spiritual choice, truth discernment.
3. Unselfish love, brotherhood service.
4. Purposeful co-operation, group loyalty.
5. Cosmic insight, the grasp of universe meanings.
6. Personality dedication, wholehearted devotion to doing the Father's will.

Human self-consciousness implies the recognition of the reality of selves other than the conscious self and further implies that such awareness is mutual; that the self is known as it knows. This is shown in a purely human manner in man's social life. But you cannot become so absolutely certain of a fellow being's reality as you can of the reality of the presence of God that lives within you. The social consciousness is not inalienable like the God-consciousness; it is a cultural development and is dependent on knowledge symbols, and the contributions of the constitutive endowments of man--science morality, and religion.

Unselfishness, aside from parental instinct, is not altogether natural; other persons are not naturally loved or socially served. It requires the enlightenment of reason, morality, and the urge of religion, God-knowingness, to generate an unselfish and altruistic social order. Man's own personality awareness, self-consciousness, is also directly dependent on this very fact of innate other-awareness, this innate ability to recognize and grasp the reality of other personality, ranging from the human to the divine.

Unselfish social consciousness must be, at bottom, a religious consciousness; that is, if it is objective; otherwise it is a purely subjective philosophic abstraction and therefore devoid of love. Only a God-knowing individual can love another person as he loves himself.

Self-consciousness is in essence a communal consciousness: God and man, Father and son, Creator and creature. In human self-consciousness four universe-reality realizations are latent and inherent:

1. The quest for knowledge, the logic of science.
2. The quest for moral values, the sense of duty.
3. The quest for spiritual values, the religious experience.
4. The quest for personality values, the ability to recognize the reality of God as a personality and the concurrent realization of our fraternal relationship with fellow personalities.

You become conscious of man as your creature brother because you are already conscious of God as your Creator Father. Fatherhood is the relationship out of which we reason ourselves into the recognition of brotherhood. And Fatherhood becomes, or may become, a universe reality to all moral creatures because the Father has himself bestowed personality upon all such beings and has encircuited them within the grasp of the universal personality circuit. We worship God, first, because he is, then, because he is in us, and last, because we are in him.

# The Soul of Man

In responding to a question about the soul, Jesus said:

"The soul is the self-reflective, truth-discerning, and spirit-perceiving part of man which forever elevates the human being above the level of the animal world. Self-consciousness, in and of itself, is not the soul. Moral self-consciousness is true human self-realization and constitutes the foundation of the human soul. The soul is that part of man which represents the potential survival value of human experience. Moral choice and spiritual attainment, the ability to know God and the urge to be like him, are the characteristics of the soul.

"The soul of man cannot exist apart from moral thinking and spiritual activity. A stagnant soul is a dying soul. But the soul of man is distinct from the divine spirit which dwells within the mind. The divine spirit arrives simultaneously with the first moral activity of the human mind, and that is the occasion of the birth of the soul."

And from p. 1246: Upon your death, your records, identity specifications, and the soul--conjointly evolved by the ministry of mortal mind and indwelling Spirit-of-God--are faithfully conserved by the destiny guardian together with all other values related to your future existence, everything that constitutes you, the real you-- except for the identity of continuing existence and the actuality of personality both of which are represented by the indwelling God-Spirit (who rejoins you upon your reconstitution.)


# Can Universes and Life Self-generate from Nothingness?

Is a self-generating universe, starting from nothingness, a possibility? And is the spontaneous generation of life a reasonable expectation? These are the questions that, sooner or later, most of us will ask ourselves.

One answer that science has given us is that the laws of science are invalid under conditions of nothingness. Neither are they valid for the supposed conditions prior to the Big Bang. But given the Big Bang occurred, then science can certainly be helpful for estimating the probabilities of the universe developing in specified ways. Likewise for a rebound universe.

What is a rebound universe? If a universe is finite then sooner or later it should either expand forever or else collapse in a Big Crunch. The latter is different depending on whether we assume space is continuous or has some net-like structure. If continuous, the collapse could go to a dimensionless point. But if net-like then, presumably, it cannot collapse below the tiniest of its spatial dimensions and must then rebound.

If we allow ourselves to believe in some kind of self-generating universe, can we also allow ourselves to believe in the spontaneous formation of life? What are the chances for an elementary life form putting itself together from some kind of organic soup. After all there must have been a multitude of situations on the primitive earth in which all the basic ingredients necessary for living cells to self-generate were present, otherwise life would not have occurred. At least that is the hypothesis we are assuming.

All life, as we know it, consists of complex carbon-based organic molecules protected from the "outside" by some kind of membranous barrier. It would also need to be self-repairing and self-reproducing if it was to persist.

Currently it is thought that our planet came into existence about 4.5 billion years ago, and that life appeared close to the 4 billion year mark. The evidence for this includes the ratio of oxygen isotopes that accompany fossil material thought to be derived from photosynthesis by ancient organisms. This ratio is peculiar to the photosynthetic process.

Further evidence comes from the dating of ancient stromatolites in Western Australia, Canada, and elsewhere. These structures result from the activities of photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Additionally there is the dating of oxidised iron minerals that are deposited in the oceans as a result of the oxygen released into those oceans by ancient photosynthetic organisms. Those at Isua, Greenland are dated to 3.8 billion years ago.

Photosynthesis is one of the most studied of biological processes. Yet after more than 50 years of intensive effort the complexity of this process continues to defeat us--despite the potential rewards being so enormous. For if we can simulate photosynthesis, we should have an unlimited source of cheap energy.

#  How could such a complex process develop so early in the history of our planet?

To get an idea of the complexity of putting this process together, let's take a look at just one of its parts--that called photo-system 2, the catalytic core of which is shown in Figure 1. The 4 spheres having a dot in their middle represent manganese atoms, the smallest spheres are hydrogen atoms, middle size is oxygen, and a single calcium atom is at the apex of the box-like  structure.

The manganese atoms in the box pass electrons on to the single one outside. Three electrons is enough to give it the potential to split its attached water molecule, which reaction yields an OH (hydroxyl) radical plus a proton. The next electron destroys the radical which becomes an activated oxygen atom.

The single calcium atom at the apex of the box holds its attached water molecule in exactly the right place to be attacked by the activated oxygen, the result being a normal oxygen molecule (O2), plus 2 hydrogens that are at the disposal of the host bacterium to combine with carbon to produce sugars, etc.

This core catalytic center of photosystem 2 has so far resisted all attempts to synthesize it. Yet every single day, using energy from the sun, simple single-cell bacteria produce it by the truck load.

But this is only one cog in a complex wheel. Additionally involved in photosynthesis there is photosystem 1 absorbing light at longer wave lengths, plus chlorophyll, also light absorbing, plus a group of proteins specifically tailored to stabilize the structure of the systems, even repairing or replacing them when necessary.

All of this amazing repertoire would need to have been present by the time these bacteria became effective at oxygenating the oceans sufficiently to precipitate oxidised iron minerals in layers on the floor of the oceans 3.8 billion years ago and build stromatolites almost 4 billion years ago.

Just how many different proteins were present in these very first photosynthetic bacteria almost certainly numbered above a thousand. But even if it had been just a dozen or so, the complexity of producing them is illustrated by calculations of the probability of building just one specific protein molecule through the random choice of the amino-acid building blocks from which all protein is formed.

The sequence of those building blocks is specified by the sequence of units of three nucleotides made up of adenine, guanine, thymine, and cytosine that compose the DNA gene specifying a specific protein. The chances of forming a single functional gene for an average size protein comes out at one in 10150 assuming the random selection of the sequence.

Such probabilities are multiplicative. So if we wish to make a second type of protein molecule we have to multiply 10150 by 10150 which is 10300--an utterly and impossibly remote possiblity.

In considering the origins of life on our planet nobody has yet come up with any reasonable concept of the mechanics of how such a process could have occurred.

But this is not our only set of unknowns for highly improbable events. Example--what are the chances of a universe like ours creating itself by itself? We have touched upon this in an earlier issue of Innerface but it is important enough to merit a reminder.

To actually design a universe like ours, at our present state of knowledge there are about 20 parameters (numbers) that must be entered as a 'best guess.' These include: how strong do we make gravity, or electric charge, or the force that holds an atomic nucleus together, and so on?

Ideally, if we had a perfect theory covering all aspects of material reality, these numbers would naturally fall out from the theory. But, at present, we have two major theories, one covering reality on a large scale (General Relativity), the other covering the scale of the atom and below with a similar degree of accuracy (Quantum Theory)--and they are incompatible!

Image here

The first of these, General Relativity, in a study on two neutron stars spiralling towards each other, has been shown to be accurate to one part in 1014 (100 million million). Nevertheless physicists claim quantum theory is the most accurate theory known to man. But despite this quite incredible accuracy of present theory, we still have to make educated guesses at the values of 20 parameters that we need for a 'final' theory.

How then would God go about creating a universe like ours containing people like us? To commence let's have God simply attempt to create a universe having stars like ours.

Let's imagine God is seated before a bank of celestial computers having the twenty dials that tune the parameters for providing the required outcome. He starts with the most important--tuning the force of gravity. The control dial is set in terms of proton masses and must be tuned so that stars are formed of the right size and lifetime to eventually provide a stable universe. If the stars are too small, they will not ignite to burn their hydrogen fuel to helium, if they are too big they won't last long enough to be useful. Or they might collapse to a black hole.

After some tinkering, the computers throw up the number, 1x10-38 proton masses. That means one divided by 10 followed by 38 zeros. Now that's tiny. God punches a few keys and gets some answers--the expected life of an average star comes out as ten billion years, which is about what is needed. Dropping a zero reduces lifetime by 1000-fold, drop another zero and the star lasts only 10,000 years. God accepts the computer value.

The next important job is selecting a cosmological constant that will fix the mass-energy density of space. The computers say it must be set to no more than 10-40 proton masses. More tinkering and it is found that for any bigger value, the universe won't last long enough to produce stars. God again accepts the computer value.

God still has 18 parameters (values) to assign. While he does the work, let's find out what the chances are of getting our kind of stars in our kind of universe if we just spin those twenty tuning dials at random.

That's not a major problem for the celestial computers, and the answer comes in a fraction of a second as just one chance in 10229. That means one chance in 10 followed by 229 zeros!!! One chance in 10229 is so incredibly slight as to be beyond our wildest imagining--for all intents and purposes, impossible.

But a starry universe is only a beginning. For life to exist, the stars need to have planets and, among other things, inhabitable planets need to have an orbit giving a temperature range that permits permanent surface water to exist. Then an atmosphere, the right balance of chemicals, and thousands of other critical little things are essentials. Like the crucial need for an ultra-violet light filter at the top of the atmosphere. Or the right amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. A few percent increase and our forests and grasslands go up in an unstoppable blaze. Or too much carbon dioxide, and temperatures soar, the ice cap melts, ocean levels rise, islands disappear, low lying continental land is flooded, millions become homeless and displaced. Maybe all this will happen anyhow!

All things considered, the possibility for self-generating universes and self-creating life does not appear all that bright. In fact it appears to be impossibly remote. So what does the Urantia revelation tell us.

"That we are called Life Carriers should not confuse you. We can and do carry life to the planets, but we brought no life to Urantia. Urantia life is unique, original with the planet. This sphere is a life-modification world; all life appearing hereon was formulated by us right here on the planet; (667)

"The material self, the ego-entity of human identity, is dependent during the physical life on the continuing function of the material life vehicle, on the continued existence of the unbalanced equilibrium of energies and intellect which, on Urantia, has been given the name life". (1229)

There was a time when we could put these two widely separated statements together and contend that they mean that only if an organism has the potential to develop intellect do the Urantia Book authors classify it as "life." Accepting this definition, we could live with the indisputable evidence for what we have routinely calld "life" existed almost 4 billion years ago.

The following quotations nullify that interpretation.

"550,000,000 years ago the Life Carrier corps returned to Urantia. In co-operation with spiritual powers and superphysical forces we organized and initiated the original life patterns of this world and planted them in the hospitable waters of the realm. All planetary life down to the days of Caligastia, the Planetary Prince, had its origin in our three original, identical, and simultaneous marine-life implantations." (667)

"The bacteria, simple vegetable organisms of a very primitive nature, are very little changed from the early dawn of life; they even exhibit a degree of retrogression in their parasitic behavior. Many of the fungi also represent a retrograde movement in evolution, being plants which have lost their chlorophyll-making ability and have become more or less parasitic. The majority of disease-causing bacteria and their auxiliary virus bodies really belong to this group of renegade parasitic fungi. During the intervening ages all of the vast kingdom of plant life has evolved from ancestors from which the bacteria have also descended." (732)

Written by a "Life Carrier," it is written as if there was no life of any kind (including bacterial life), on this planet prior to the implantations made by the Life carriers just 550,000,000 years ago.

This accords with what most believed in the 1930's--that the pre-Cambrian period was devoid of life forms until the Cambrian age about half a billion years ago. It also accords with what is expressed on page 1109.

"The laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge." (1109)

In many instances the Revelators have gone to extremes to follow their mandate. But they did tell us what they were doing, if we would listen. (see also 1008, 1260)

However they have given us their answer to the question of whether life is a spontaneously occurring phenomena. No, life is not a spontaneously occurring phenomena. It is always brought to the planets by the Life Carriers.

"Life does not spontaneously appear in the universes; the Life Carriers must initiate it on the barren planets." (399)

The Life Carriers often carry actual life plasm to a new world, but not always. They sometimes organize the life patterns after arriving on the planet. Such was the origin of the planetary life of Urantia. (399)

"That we are called Life Carriers should not confuse you. We can and do carry life to the planets, but we brought no life to Urantia. Urantia life is unique, original with the planet. This sphere is a life-modification world; all life appearing hereon was formulated by us right here on the planet." (667)

According to the Urantia revelation, Life Carriers first visited this planet 900,000,000 years ago as part of an inspection commission which recommended Urantia be placed on the life-experiment registry. They returned 600,000,000 years ago but decided to wait before initiating life, something which was done 550,000,000 years ago.

So whereas the overall description of life establishment procedures may be correct, the details for Urantia certainly is in conflict with current evidence, though in line with what most thought in the early 1930 period. Perhaps we will get the opportunity to check it out on the Mansion Worlds.

That leaves us with the other question--do universes create themselves? The answer again is no, they are created. An interesting addition is that they are regulated. They do not run down and energy flow is regulated, a cyclic process that is heading towards a steady state equilibrium.

"Supreme Power Centers are permanently assigned to our local universe. These beings receive the incoming lines of power and relay the down-stepped and modified circuits to the power centers of our constellations and systems...Power centers are not, however, concerned with transient and local energy upheavals, such as sun spots and system electric disturbances; light and electricity are not the basic energies of space; they are secondary and subsidiary manifestations." (456)

The power-energy supervision of the evolutionary inhabited worlds is the responsibility of the Master Physical Controllers. They are able to effect energy control in a collective as well as an individual capacity. As requirements vary, they can upstep and accelerate the energy volume and movement or detain, condense, and retard the energy currents. They influence energy and power transformations somewhat as so-called catalytic agents augment chemical reactions. They function by inherent ability and in co-operation with the Supreme Power Centers. (326, 457)

So, barring an accident, it appears that our planet should be safe for a long time into the future.

# Creation of the Universe. Did God participate?

The curiosities of quantum theory (see Innerface vol. 11, No. 5) have many of our physicists in a non-materialistic dither. In seeking to make sense of their own quite extraordinary and quite brilliant experimental results, they have  proposed apparently outrageous explanations.

One such proposal is that the whole of our universe, as we perceive it, is actually a hologram--in reality a four-dimensional system operating in compliance with a set of physical laws on a 3-dimensional boundary of space-time.1 And perhaps it could be so, even is so, if it operates under the control of deity consciousness functioning via a non-local dimension outside our local space-time.

[non-local is the name given to a dimension not in our space-time which messages can traverse instantaneously. It is also the 'home' of particles in a state of super-positioning such as an electron that is neither wave nor particle but a combination 'wavicle.' Its existence was predicated by Irish physicist, John Bell, and demonstrated experimentally by French physicist, Alain Aspect. See Innerface vol. 11, No. 5]

Another proposal by Raphael Bousso utilizes a 2-D boundary so that our innate perception of the world as having 3 spatial dimensions would be an "extraordinary illusion." But is it really so extraordinary? For when looking at any normal scene, the image our minds perceive, though apparently in 3-D, is actually a flat 2-D image upon the retinas at the back of our eyeballs.

It is a truly remarkable feat of our brain that we can quite unconsciously make that 2-D to 3-D transformation, even to judging relative distances and estimating the speed of different objects at a variety of distances.

This remarkable ability is obviously an innate function of mind that extends way back into the evolution of the animal and insect worlds of the past--and is an essential  survival attribute for both predator and prey. And it all must be constructed from information stored in our memories of previous related experiences.

So what are the new experiments that merit our praise and appreciation? Those that currently interest us have been mainly conducted to discover how far certain strange quantum phenomena can be preserved as the size of the object under study is increased from the sub-microscopic to take in the "real" world, the one we can actually touch, feel, see, and smell.

One of the key apparent differences between the familiar classical world we inhabit and the strange quantum world is the phenomenon of "superposition"--the ability of quantum objects to exist in two different states such as wave and particle, but at the same time.

Previously we have described this behavior for photons, electrons, and even atoms, and molecules.3 Now it has been demonstrated for large spherical molecules called fullerenes consisting of 70 carbon atoms that form a ball .

To do so, fullerene molecules were fired, one at a time, at two diffraction gratings (see below). Initially the target simply showed where each single molecule hit. But as the number increased to about two thousand, the detector began to show a perfect pattern of interference stripes.

As with electrons, etc., in the same type of experiment3, it was concluded that each of the fullerene molecules must interfere with itself. So where was the information that permitted formation of the striped interference pattern?

A possible answer to this problem was revealed by varying the temperature of the fullerene molecules prior to them passing through the first grating. Hot matter radiates thermal photons over a wide spectrum of wave lengths. Below 1700o C, the fullerene molecules are unlikely to radiate wave lengths in the visible range. But at 2200o C each molecule should radiate at least three such photons. Outside this temperature range photon emission fell away, as did the diffraction pattern--which is consistent with the hypothesis that these emitted photons carried the information utilized to form the bar pattern.

The hypothesis was strengthened by double slit experiments (see ref. 4) that modified the wave length of the photons emitted by electrons passing through slits. The photon's wave length determined whether or not the interference pattern was washed out.

But that leaves us with an even harder question. How can a mere photon possibly carry such information? Answer--we do not know.

Is there a limit to the size of objects that can show this extraordinary behavior? Apparently not as nothing in quantum theory puts any limit to this size. Even living things (to be tested shortly) are expected to behave likewise.

Apparently a completely new theory will be necessary. Anton Zeilinger, leader of the fullerene experiment team, had this to say: "Something else--some other undiscovered theory--will have to explain what role information plays. But if you are thinking that this new theory will put us out of our collective misery over the weirdness we see in quantum experiments, think again. There's no indication that it shouldn't get weirder."

Items that interest us for the discussion that follows are: Objects that become super-positioned may always and instantaneously be located in non-local space--where they will remain in waiting for such an occasion as being recalled by an observer to normal local space. Once made, that recall occurs instantaneously.

It may also be true that all material objects not being observed by a conscious observer are in such a state. That is the thinking behind the statement of quantum physicists that the moon is not there unless an observer is observing it.

So where is the moon if one person is observing it and another is not doing so? The most likely reality is that it is there for the one looking, but not for the person not looking. It has to be in the observer's mind to be his or her reality.

Experimental work indicates that information about what has happened, is happening, and perhaps, what will happen to the fullerene molecules we have described is carried from the fullerene being observed by emitted photons. Previous such work also shows that the amount of information being generated and needing to be instantly available in such events can be large and variable. How is this necessary information stored, who keeps the records, and who or what makes the decisions about which information is to be activated?

Further questions remain, an important one being how many "bits" of information would be required to move from a non-local dimension to a specific address in a local one. How does a photon in non-local space 'know' where it came from?

Since the observer is normally completely unconscious about the details of this process and, for the most part, has zero knowledge that such a process exists, observers can be ruled out as being the necessary information banks.

These information banks, if they exist, must surely also be located in non-local space. And as the over-all process appears to include decision making, it becomes extremely difficult to perceive it as being other than subject to conscious control. Could it be computerized? Possibly, but who built the computer, who maintains it, and who runs it?

Few have had the courage to even speculate about this problem. One view that is held by those who subscribe to a philosophy termed "monistic idealism" is that the whole universe is created from consciousness and is existent only in consciousness--the consciousness of God. For such idealists, consciousness is the ground of all being.

The Urantia revelation puts it this way: The universe is mind planned, mind made, and mind administered. (481)

All the worlds of every universe are constantly within the consciousness of God. (49)

God is possessed of unlimited power to know all things; his consciousness is universal. (49)

When man analytically inspects the universe through the material endowments of his physical senses and associated mind perception, the cosmos appears to be mechanical and energy-material. Such a technique of studying reality consists in turning the universe inside out. (1135)

A logical and consistent philosophic concept of the universe cannot be built up on the postulations of either materialism or spiritism, for both of these systems of thinking, when universally applied, are compelled to view the cosmos in distortion, the former contacting with a universe turned inside out, the latter realizing the nature of a universe turned outside in. Never, then, can either science or religion, in and of themselves, standing alone, hope to gain an adequate understanding of universal truths and relationships without the guidance of human philosophy and the illumination of divine revelation. (1135)



Unaided, faith and reason cannot conceive nor construct a logical universe. And without insight into the spiritual domain, mortal man cannot discern love, truth, beauty, and goodness in the phenomena of the material world. Revelation is evolutionary man's only realistic hope of bridging the gulf between the material and spiritual domain. But revelation is always personal. Therefore must man live, by faith, midst uncertainty. And this truth is the inevitable accompaniment of God's most precious gift of free will to all mankind. (from 1137)

Is there another way to explain quantum weirdness such as the existence of a spatial dimension outside of our own space-time in which messages are transferred instantaneously, in which complex decisions appear to be made, and which must hold absolutely enormous memory banks plus a way to relate their contents correctly to occurrences within our space-time?

Is it necessary that all this and much more should be attributed to an unknown and unknowable God?

We human earthlings have a long history of attributing to God all those phenomena that we don't understand, plus a good many more besides. And mostly we have been totally wrong. This time we look to be the winner. However the likelihood is that we will never know for certain. And that appears to be how things were intended to be. How else could we have true free will?

# Communing with God--
from the Urantia Revelation

Enlightened prayer must recognize not only an external and personal God but also an internal and impersonal Divinity, the indwelling Spirit of the Father. It is altogether fitting that man, when he prays, should strive to grasp the concept of the Universal Father on Paradise; but the more effective technique for most practical purposes will be to revert to the concept of a near-by alter ego, just as the primitive mind was wont to do, and then to recognize that the idea of this alter ego has evolved from a mere fiction to the truth of God's indwelling mortal man in the factual presence of the indwelling God-Spirit so that man can talk face to face, as it were, with a real and genuine and divine alter ego that indwells him and is the very presence and essence of the living God, the Universal Father.

No prayer can be ethical when the petitioner seeks for selfish advantage over his fellows. Selfish and materialistic praying is incompatible with the ethical religions which are predicated on unselfish and divine love. All such unethical praying reverts to the primitive levels of pseudo magic and is unworthy of advancing civilizations and enlightened religions. Selfish praying trangresses the spirit of all ethics founded on loving justice.

Prayer ever has been and ever will be a twofold human experience: a psychologic procedure inter-associated with a spiritual technique. And these two functions of prayer can never be fully separated. (997)
