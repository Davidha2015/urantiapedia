# Secrets of Jesus Spirituality

"The secret of his (Jesus) unparalleled religious life was this consciousness of the presence of God; and he attained it by intelligent prayer and sincere worship--unbroken communion with God--and not by leadings, voices, visions, or extra-ordinary religious practices.

"In the earthly life of Jesus, religion was a living experience, a direct and personal movement from spiritual reverence to practical righteousness. The faith of Jesus bore the transcendent fruits of the divine spirit. His faith was not immature and credulous like that of a child, but in many ways it did resemble the unsuspecting trust of the child mind.

"Jesus trusted God much as the child trusts a parent. He had a profound confidence in the universe--just such a trust as the child has in its parental environment. Jesus' wholehearted faith in the fundamental goodness of the universe very much resembled the child's trust in the security of its earthly surroundings. He depended on the heavenly Father as a child leans upon its earthly parent, and his fervent faith never for one moment doubted the certainty of the heavenly Father's overcare. He was not disturbed seriously by fears, doubts, and skepticism. Unbelief did not inhibit the free and original expression of his life. He combined the stalwart and intelligent courage of a full-grown man with the sincere and trusting optimism of a believing child. His faith grew to such heights of trust that it was devoid of fear or despair.

"The faith of Jesus attained the purity of a child's trust. His faith was so absolute and undoubting that it responded to the charm of the contact of fellow beings and to the wonders of the universe. His sense of dependence on the divine was so complete and so confident that it yielded the joy and the assurance of absolute personal security. There was no hesitating pretense in his religious experience. In this giant intellect of the full-grown man the faith of the child reigned supreme in all matters relating to the religious consciousness. It is not strange that he once said, 'Except you become as a little child, you shall not enter the kingdom.' Notwithstanding that Jesus' faith was childlike, it was in no sense childish." (2089)

# Did Jesus really need to be crucified?
Summary

The Urantia revelation rejects the concept that Jesus' crucifixion was a sacrificial offering made to God in full payment for the sins of mankind--a dogma subscribed to by all major Christian sects.

However, if Jesus' crucifixion was not such a sacrificial offering, why then was he crucified?

Jesus' teachings were completely peaceful, threatening no one. He was no rabble rouser, he deplored violence, refused to defend himself, regularly used statements such as if someone demands your coat, give him your cloak as well, or if he forces you to carry his bag for one mile, carry it an extra mile.

Right up to the time of his arrest, both he and his apostles could simply have fled--all the way to Galilee, and beyond if necessary. He allowed his capture and instructed his apostles not to resist.

The accounts of his arrest both in the New Testament and the Urantia revelation show that his opposition group had no legal case against him. They had to fabricate something.

The accounts of events prior to the arrest also agree that Jesus asked the Father if there was any way the crucifixion could be avoided. (TUB p.1968; Matt. 26:39; Mark 14:36) Apparently there was not.


Jesus' Spirit of Truth--its work and effects


On the night before the crucifixion, Jesus addressed the apostles: "If I go not away, the new teacher cannot come into your hearts. I must be divested of this mortal body and be restored to my place on high before I can send this spirit teacher to live in your souls and lead your spirits into the truth. And when my spirit comes to indwell you, it will illuminate the difference between sin and righteousness and will enable you to judge wisely in your hearts concerning them." (1951)

"When I have been delivered from this investment of mortal nature, I will be able to return as a spirit indweller of each of you and of all other believers in this gospel of the kingdom. In this way the Son of Man will become a spiritual incarnation in the souls of all true believers." (1953)

The chief purpose of the Spirit of Truth--to foster awareness of its chief purpose: "The chief purpose in living is in doing the Father's will." (1951)

"If you would follow after me when I leave you, put forth your earnest efforts to live in accordance with the spirit of my teachings and with the ideal of my life--the doing of my Father's will." (1953)

"Jesus gives peace to his fellow doers of the will of God but not on the order of the joys and satisfactions of this material world. The peace which Michael (Jesus) gives his children on earth is that very peace which filled his own soul when he himself lived the mortal life in the flesh and on this very world. The peace of Jesus is the joy and satisfaction of a God-knowing individual who has achieved the triumph of learning fully how to do the will of God while living the mortal life in the flesh. The peace of Jesus' mind was founded on an absolute human faith in the actuality of the divine Father's wise and sympathetic overcare." (1954)

"The Master knew all that was to befall him, and he was unafraid. After he had bestowed this peace upon each of his followers, he could consistently say, "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." (1955)

"The peace of Jesus is, then, the peace and assurance of a son who fully believes that his career for time and eternity is safely and wholly in the care and keeping of an all-wise, all-loving, and all-powerful spirit Father. And this is, indeed, a peace which passes the understanding of mortal mind, but which can be enjoyed to the full by the believing human heart." (1955)

# At Gethsemane:
Personal farewell admonitions by Jesus to the apostles

To John:

Jesus: "You will learn to love your brethren more when you first learn to love their Father in heaven more, and after you have become truly more interested in their welfare in time and in eternity." (1955)

To James: "When the new teacher comes, let him teach you the poise of compassion and that sympathetic tolerance which is born of sublime confidence in me and of perfect submission to the Father's will. Dedicate your life to the demonstration of that combined human affection and divine dignity of the God-knowing and Son-believing disciple. And all who thus live will reveal the gospel even in the manner of their death." (1958)

To Philip, the materialist: "And then, when you are blessed with spiritual vision, go forth to your work, dedicating your life to the cause of leading mankind to search for God and to seek eternal realities with the eye of spiritual faith and not with the eyes of the material mind. Remember, Philip, you have a great mission on earth, for the world is filled with those who look at life just as you have tended to. You have a great work to do, and when it is finished in faith, you shall come to me in my kingdom, and I will take great pleasure in showing you that which eye has not seen, ear heard, nor the mortal mind conceived. In the meantime, become as a little child in the kingdom of the spirit and permit me, as the spirit of the new teacher, to lead you forward in the spiritual kingdom. And in this way will I be able to do much for you which I was not able to accomplish when I sojourned with you as a mortal of the realm. And always remember, Philip, he who has seen me has seen the Father." (1960)

To Nathaniel, the intellectual: "You should learn that the expression of even a good thought must be modulated in accordance with the intellectual status and spiritual development of the hearer. Sincerity is most serviceable in the work of the kingdom when it is wedded to discretion. If you would learn to work with your brethren, you might accomplish more permanent things, but if you find yourself going off in quest of those who think as you do, in that event dedicate your life to proving that the God-knowing disciple can become a kingdom builder even when alone in the world and wholly isolated from his fellow believers. I know you will be faithful to the end, and I will some day welcome you to the enlarged service of my kingdom on high." (1960)

# The last hour before Jesus' arrest

"David Zebedee and John Mark took Jesus to one side and revealed that they had kept Judas under observation for several days, and that they knew he intended to betray him into the hands of his enemies. Jesus listened to them but only said: "My friends, nothing can happen to the Son of Man unless the Father in heaven so wills. Let not your hearts be troubled; all things will work together for the glory of God and the salvation of men." (1966)

At Gethsemane: "Falling down on the ground, Jesus again prayed: '"Father, I know it is possible to avoid this cup--all things are possible with you--but I have come to do your will, and while this is a bitter cup, I would drink it if it is your will.'" And when he had thus prayed, a mighty angel came down by his side and, speaking to him, touched him and strengthened him." (1968)

"And now, O Father, if this cup may not pass, then would I drink it. Not my will, but yours, be done." (1968)

"Just now the apostles were about to witness new evidences of his humanity. Just before the greatest of all the revelations of his divinity, his resurrection, must now come the greatest proofs of his mortal nature--his humiliation and crucifixion." (1968)

"Each time Jesus prayed in the garden, his humanity laid a firmer faith-hold upon his divinity; his human will more completely became one with the divine will of his Father. Among other words spoken to him by the mighty angel was the message that the Father desired his Son to finish his earth bestowal by passing through the creature experience of death just as all mortal creatures must experience material dissolution in passing from the existence of time into the progression of eternity." (1969)

"While no mortal can presume to understand the thoughts and feelings of the incarnate Son of God at such a time as this, we know that he endured great anguish and suffered untold sorrow, for the perspiration rolled off his face in great drops. He was at last convinced that the Father intended to allow natural events to take their course; he was fully determined to employ none of his sovereign power as the supreme head of a universe to save himself." (1969)

Why would the Father allow his Son to be crucified? At this point in time Jesus and his apostles could have fled to the security of Philip's kingdom east of the Jordan or even into Phonecia.


But could the apostles be trusted to conserve and pass on Jesus' teachings?


"The experience of parting with the apostles was a great strain on the human heart of Jesus; this sorrow of love bore down on him and made it more difficult to face such a death as he well knew awaited him. He realized how weak and how ignorant his apostles were, and he dreaded to leave them. He well knew that the time of his departure had come, but his human heart longed to find out whether there might not possibly be some legitimate avenue of escape from this terrible plight of suffering and sorrow. And when it had thus sought escape, and failed, it was willing to drink the cup." (1969)

"The divine mind of Michael (Jesus) knew he had done his best for the twelve apostles; but the human heart of Jesus wished that more might have been done for them before they should be left alone in the world. Jesus' human heart was being crushed; he truly loved his brethren. He was isolated from his family in the flesh; one of his chosen associates was betraying him. His father Joseph's people had rejected him and thereby sealed their doom as a people with a special mission on earth. His soul was tortured by baffled love and rejected mercy. It was just one of those awful human moments when everything seems to bear down with crushing cruelty and terrible agony." (1969)

"Jesus' humanity was not insensible to this situation of private loneliness, public shame, and the appearance of the failure of his cause. All these sentiments bore down on him with indescribable heaviness." (1969)


Jesus' arrest


"Before Judas and the soldiers arrived, the Master had fully regained his customary poise; the spirit had triumphed over the flesh; faith had asserted itself over all human tendencies to fear or entertain doubt. The supreme test of the full realization of the human nature had been met and acceptably passed. Once more the Son of Man was prepared to face his enemies with equanimity and in the full assurance of his invincibility as a mortal man unreservedly dedicated to the doing of his Father's will." (1970)

# What were the alternatives?

The Urantia revelation rejects the concept that Jesus died for our sins, making this comment: "The people of Urantia continue to suffer from the influence of primitive concepts of God….The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive, a philosophy unworthy of an enlightened age of science and truth. Such beliefs are utterly repulsive to the celestial beings and the divine rulers who serve and reign in the universes. It is an affront to God to believe, hold, or teach that innocent blood must be shed in order to win his favor or to divert the fictitious divine wrath." (60)

For most Christians, having been brought up from early childhood to accept without question that Jesus' crucifixion was to purchase forgiveness for our sins, this statement comes as somewhat of a shock. But, for most, it takes very little thought to realize the foolish contradiction inherent in the doctrine that God is both perfect love, compassion, and forgiveness yet demands that his only Son should be crucified, a sacrificial offering of his blood, in order to purchase God's forgiveness for our sins.

So why did Jesus need to die--especially that  a horrible death by crucifixion was the most likely eventuality.

Jesus' prayer to the Father at Gethsemane specifically requested release. (p. 1968) But the release did not come. What seems to have come was the reminder that Jesus' bestowal conditions required that his mortal life be terminated only by natural means. (1331)

Other than by old age or sickness, only an accidental death seems to be a possible way for a natural exit from mortality by Jesus.

Jesus deliberately undertook the visit to Jerusalem on the Passover occasion that brought about the crucifixion. And he seems to have deliberately antagonized the Sanhedrin to the point that forced them to act against him. But there appears to have been no real need to do so. He could quite easily have avoided drawing attention to himself. In fact there appears to be no obvious reason why he should have gone to Jerusalem at all.

# The answer?

Perhaps the answer is on page 1951--"If I go not away, the new teacher cannot come into your hearts. I must be divested of this mortal body and be restored to my place on high before I can send this spirit teacher to live in your souls and lead your spirits into the truth. And when my spirit comes to indwell you, he will illuminate the difference between sin and righteousness and will enable you to judge wisely in your hearts concerning them."

This statement from Jesus appears to imply that his Spirit of Truth would be a more effective teacher of righteousness than Jesus himself. And it is not difficult to see why this could be so. After three years of personal teaching by Jesus, his fundamental message of love, goodness, tolerance, and service would have become overly familiar.

Much of this message was conveyed by parables, all of which the apostles must have heard on multitudinous occasions. Perhaps Jesus realized there was little more that he could personally do to promote this message. And so long as he remained with the apostolic band, he would be the central figure that the crowds sought after--and not because of the message he brought but largely because of their expectation of miracles.

Jesus' bestowal mission required him to "live a life wholeheartedly motivated to do the will of the Paradise Father, thus to reveal God, your Father, in the flesh and especially to the creatures of the flesh." He was to "exhibit in his one short life in the flesh, the transcendent possibilities attainable by a God-knowing human being…and to function so as to show the achievement of God seeking man and finding him, and the phenomenon of man seeking God and finding him." (p.1328)

Jesus may have judged that he had already fulfilled his mission on Urantia--which would be better served if his bestowal was terminated now and the preservation and dissemination of its message was entrusted to his Spirit of Truth and the apostles.

Recalling the statement, "God has decreed the sovereignty of the material and mortal will and that decree is absolute," (71) it appears that both Jesus and the Father were taking an enormous gamble by having Michael's bestowal terminate at this juncture. Jesus realization of this is illustrated by, "The experience of parting with the apostles was a great strain on the human heart of Jesus; this sorrow of love bore down on him and made it more difficult to face such a death as he well knew awaited him. He realized how weak and how ignorant his apostles were, and he dreaded to leave them. (1969)

Their behavior during the period of Jesus' arrest, trial, and crucifixion illustrates the validity of Jesus' doubting. Peter denied him three times during Jesus' trial. Of the eleven remaining apostles only John was present both at the trial and crucifixion. The others all went into hiding and remained hidden even after Jesus' resurrection appearances. And their courage remained in limbo until the events of Pentecost--after they had received Jesus' Spirit of Truth.

That Jesus expected his presence as the Spirit of Truth would be more effective for spreading his gospel message than his presence in the flesh was confirmed by: 

"In less than a month after the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth, the apostles made more individual spiritual progress than during their almost four years of personal and loving association with the Master."

And further confirmed by his farewell admonition to the apostle Philip: "Permit me as the spirit of the new teacher to lead you forward. In this way will I be able to do much for you which I was not able to accomplish when I sojourned with you as a mortal of the realm. (1960)

Subsequent events also validated Jesus' trust in these men. Furthermore they validated his confidence in the Spirit of Truth, operating in the minds of believers, and functioning to promote the dominance of truth, beauty, goodness, and love in the affairs of men.

Although not the religion that we would expect Jesus to have founded, early Christianity retained and/or conserved much of Jesus' basic teachings. They are still there, present in the gospels, awaiting their rediscovery.

Christianity's  major initial failing was that it was virtually a closed Jewish movement. Christianity gained universality only when Paul came along and forced the Christian leadership to open up to the gentiles. However, instead of its primary message of love and service, Paul compromised so that its attraction for the majority of converts hinged upon the concept that Jesus died for our sins. This concept was what catalyzed its wildfire-like spread throughout the Roman Empire.

Christianity remains so encumbered, even today, still awaiting its release. However, guilt and the fear of divine retribution from the God of the Old Testament is so deeply embedded in the human psyche that release from its shackles will likely be a difficult and painful process.

However, the remedy is in our own hands. When enough of us enlist the aid of Jesus' Spirit of Truth, amazing things will come to pass.

# What the Urantia Revelation says about the Spirit of Truth

When the Son of Man has finished his work on earth, there shall be poured out upon all flesh the living Spirit of Truth. Those who receive this spirit shall never know spiritual thirst." (1795)

"And when the Father shall approve, I will pour out the Spirit of Truth upon all flesh. Already is my Father's spirit in your hearts, and when this day shall come, you will also have me with you even as you now have the Father. This new gift is the spirit of living truth. The unbelievers will not at first listen to the teachings of this spirit, but the sons of light will all receive him gladly and with a whole heart. And you shall know this spirit when he comes even as you have known me, and you will receive this gift in your hearts, and he will abide with you. You thus perceive that I am not going to leave you without help and guidance. I will not leave you desolate. Today I can be with you only in person. In the times to come I will be with you and all other men who desire my presence, wherever you may be, and with each of you at the same time. Do you not discern that it is better for me to go away; that I leave you in the flesh so that I may the better and the more fully be with you in the spirit?" (1948)

Love, unselfishness, must undergo a constant and living re-adaptive interpretation of relationships in accordance with the leading of the Spirit of Truth. Love must thereby grasp the ever-changing and enlarging concepts of the highest cosmic good of the individual who is loved. And then love goes on to strike this same attitude concerning all other individuals who could possibly be influenced by the growing and living relationship of one spirit-led mortal's love for other citizens of the universe. And this entire living adaptation of love must be effected in the light of both the environment of present evil and the eternal goal of the perfection of divine destiny. (1950)

And so must we clearly recognize that neither the golden rule nor the teaching of non-resistance can ever be properly understood as dogmas or precepts. They can only be comprehended by living them, by realizing their meanings in the living interpretation of the Spirit of Truth, who directs the loving contact of one human being with another.

"I have yet much to say to you, but you cannot stand any more just now. Albeit, when he, the Spirit of Truth, comes, he shall eventually guide you into all truth as you pass through the many abodes in my Father's universe. This spirit will not speak of himself, but he will declare to you that which the Father has revealed to the Son, and he will even show you things to come; he will glorify me even as I have glorified my Father. This spirit comes forth from me, and he will reveal my truth to you. Everything which the Father has in this domain is now mine; wherefore did I say that this new teacher would take of that which is mine and reveal it to you." (1951)

"The Father sent me into this world, but only a few of you have chosen fully to receive me. I will pour out my spirit upon all flesh, but all men will not choose to receive this new teacher as the guide and counselor of the soul. But as many as do receive him shall be enlightened, cleansed, and comforted. And this Spirit of Truth will become in them a well of living water springing up into eternal life." (1954)

"If you will be taught by the Spirit of Truth, never will there be conflict between the requirements of citizenship on earth and sonship in heaven unless the temporal rulers presume to require of you the homage and worship which belong only to God." (1956)

"Then shall the Spirit of Truth lead each of you abroad to labor for the extension of the kingdom. Many changes have come over you since that day...when you first set out to follow me; but many more must come before you will be able to see the vision of a brotherhood in which gentile sits alongside Jew in fraternal association. But go on with your urge to win your Jewish brethren until you are fully satisfied and then turn with power to the gentiles." (1957)

"I have taught you much by word of mouth, and I have lived my life among you. I have done all that can be done to enlighten your minds and liberate your souls, and what you have not been able to get from my teachings and my life, you must now prepare to acquire at the hand of that master of all teachers--actual experience. And in all of this new experience which now awaits you, I will go before you and the Spirit of Truth shall be with you. Fear not; that which you now fail to comprehend, the new teacher, when he has come, will reveal to you throughout the remainder of your life on earth and on through your training in the eternal ages." (1961)

Bestowal of the Spirit of Truth at Pentecost:

About one o'clock, as the one hundred and twenty believers were engaged in prayer, they all became aware of a strange presence in the room. At the same time these disciples all became conscious of a new and profound sense of spiritual joy, security, and confidence. This new consciousness of spiritual strength was immediately followed by a strong urge to go out and publicly proclaim the gospel of the kingdom and the good news that Jesus had risen from the dead. Peter stood up and declared that this must be the coming of the Spirit of Truth which the Master had promised them and proposed that they go to the temple and begin the proclamation of the good news committed to their hands. And they did just what Peter suggested. (2059)

The Spirit of Truth...is designed to live in man and, for each new generation, to restate the Jesus' message so that every new group of mortals to appear upon the face of the earth shall have a new and up-to-date version of the gospel, just such personal enlightenment and group guidance as will prove to be an effective solvent for man's ever-new and varied spiritual difficulties. (2060)

The first mission of this spirit is, of course, to foster and personalize truth, for it is the comprehension of truth that constitutes the highest form of human liberty. Next, it is the purpose of this spirit to destroy the believer's feeling of orphanhood. Jesus having been among men, all believers would experience a sense of loneliness had not the Spirit of Truth come to dwell in men's hearts. (2060)

This bestowal of the Son's spirit effectively prepared all normal men's minds for the subsequent universal bestowal of the Father's spirit (the Adjuster) upon all mankind. In a certain sense, this Spirit of Truth is the spirit of both the Universal Father and the Creator Son. (2061)

Do not make the mistake of expecting to become strongly intellectually conscious of the outpoured Spirit of Truth. The spirit never creates a consciousness of himself, only a consciousness of Michael, the Son. From the beginning Jesus taught that the spirit would not speak of himself. The proof, therefore, of your fellowship with the Spirit of Truth is not to be found in your consciousness of this spirit but rather in your experience of enhanced fellowship with Michael. (2061)

The spirit also came to help men recall and understand the words of the Master as well as to illuminate and reinterpret his life on earth. (2061)

Next, the Spirit of Truth came to help the believer to bear witness to the realities of Jesus' teachings and his life as he lived it in the flesh, and as he now again lives it anew and afresh in the individual believer of each passing generation of the spirit-filled sons of God. (2061)

Thus it appears that the Spirit of Truth comes really to lead all believers into all truth, into the expanding knowledge of the experience of the living and growing spiritual consciousness of the reality of eternal and ascending sonship with God. (2061)

Do not overlook the fact that the Spirit of Truth was bestowed upon all sincere believers; this gift of the spirit did not come only to the apostles. The one hundred and twenty men and women assembled in the upper chamber all received the new teacher, as did all the honest of heart throughout the whole world. This new teacher was bestowed upon mankind, and every soul received him in accordance with their love for truth and their capacity to grasp and comprehend spiritual realities. At last, true religion is delivered from the custody of priests and all sacred classes and finds its real manifestation in the individual souls of men. (2063)

The coming of the Spirit of Truth on Pentecost made possible a religion which is neither radical nor conservative; it is neither the old nor the new; it is to be dominated neither by the old nor the young. The fact of Jesus' earthly life provides a fixed point for the anchor of time, while the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth provides for the everlasting expansion and endless growth of the religion which he lived and the gospel which he proclaimed. The spirit guides into all truth; he is the teacher of an expanding and always-growing religion of endless progress and divine unfolding. This new teacher will be forever unfolding to the truth-seeking believer that which was so divinely folded up in the person and nature of the Son of Man. (2063)

The bestowal of the Spirit of Truth was independent of all forms, ceremonies, sacred places, and special behavior by those who received the fullness of its manifestation. (2064)

The coming of the Spirit of Truth purifies the human heart and leads the recipient to formulate a life purpose single to the will of God and the welfare of men. The material spirit of selfishness has been swallowed up in this new spiritual bestowal of selflessness. Pentecost, then and now, signifies that the Jesus of history has become the divine Son of living experience. The joy of this outpoured spirit, when it is consciously experienced in human life, is a tonic for health, a stimulus for mind, and an unfailing energy for the soul. (2065)

# Summary

Over almost 2000 years only a handful of isolated individuals have utilized the potential available with the Spirit of Truth to further advance the kingdom of heaven on earth. Instead, most Christians have clung to the dogma that the main purpose of Jesus' crucifixion was as a blood sacrifice offered to God for the forgiveness of their sins.

This despite the illogicality  of a God  whom we recognize as the epitome of perfect love and compassion--yet is the same God who demands the cruel death by crucifixion of his Son before he will forgive his ignorant earthly children for their sins--most of which are of a relatively trivial nature.

Judged from the New Testament records about the apostles, up to the day of Pentecost when they received the Spirit of Truth, they were a very ordinary pack of individuals. But from that day onwards they underwent metamorphosis. The record of their remarkable achievements was recorded by Luke in the Book of Acts. Without their heroism most probably we in the 21st century would never have heard of Jesus' Spirit of Truth--and possibly not even of Jesus.

In 1955, the publication of the Urantia Revelation changed all that. Once more mankind was made aware of the potential of the Spirit of Truth:

"to teach us to function so as to demonstrate the achievement of God seeking man and finding him and the phenomenon of man seeking God and finding him." (1328)

"to have us recognize that neither the golden rule nor the teaching on non-resistance can ever be properly understood as dogmas or precepts. They can only be comprehended by living them." (1950)

"to live in our souls, lead our spirits into the truth, and to illuminate the difference between sin and righteousness." (1951)

"to foster our awareness that the chief purpose in living is in doing the Father's will." (1951)

"to have the Son of Man become a spiritual incarnation in the souls of true believers." (1953)

"to teach us to live in accordance with the spirit of Jesus' teachings" (1953)

"to declare, "Let not your heart be troubled, neither let it be afraid." (1955)

"to bring to our awareness that our careers in time and eternity are safely and wholly in the care of an all-wise, all-loving, and all powerful spirit Father." (1955)

"to help us to labor for the extension of the kingdom." (1957)

"to teach us the poise of compassion and sympathetic tolerance." (1958)

"to inspire us to dedicate our lives to the cause of leading mankind to search for God and to seek eternal realities with the eye of spiritual faith--not with the eyes of the material mind." (1960)

"to teach us that the expression of even a good thought must be modulated in accordance with the intellectual status and spiritual development of the hearer. (1960)

"to remind us that all things work together for the glory of God and the salvation of mankind." (1966)

"to personalize truth for it is the comprehension of truth that constitutes the highest form of human liberty." (2060)

"to bear witness to the realities of Jesus' teachings and his life as he lived it in the flesh." (2061)

"to foster our love for truth and our capacity to grasp and comprehend spiritual realities." (2063)

"to purify our hearts and lead us to formulate a life purpose single to the will of God and the welfare of all mankind." (2065)

However take care not to make the mistake of expecting to become strongly intellectually conscious of the outpoured Spirit of Truth. The Spirit never creates a consciousness of himself, only a consciousness of Jesus--Michael, the Son. From the beginning Jesus taught that the Spirit would not speak of himself. The proof, therefore, of your fellowship with the Spirit of Truth is not to be found in you consciousness of this Spirit but rather in your experience of enhanced fellowship with Jesus--Michael. (2061)

# The relative role of miracles, resurrection, and forgiveness of sins in the rapid spread of Christianity

Whereas the fame of Jesus as a healer quickly spread throughout all parts of Palestine, Syria, and surrounding countries (1668), the ability of his apostles to sustain this reputation quickly faded following Jesus' death and resurrection. The probable reason may be found in:

"When the Creator himself was on earth, incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh, it was inevitable that some extraordinary things should happen. But you should never approach Jesus through these so-called miraculous occurrences. Learn to approach the miracle through Jesus, but do not make the mistake of approaching Jesus through the miracle. And this admonition is warranted, notwithstanding that Jesus of Nazareth is the only founder of a religion who performed super-material acts on earth." (1671)

Regarding the reality of Jesus' miraculous healings, there was no way at that time that 10 lepers could be healed of their incurable ailment (1827; Luke 17:11-19) or the blind could regain their sight (1811) except through some form of miraculous divine intervention. Both the Urantia revelation and the biblical accounts are such that we either must admit that Jesus performed real miracles of healing or else take an impossibly biased disbelieving attitude towards the evidence..

This incident of the ten lepers is also illustrative of the aberrant peculiarities of human nature. Nine of the lepers were Jews. But only one returned to thank Jesus--and that was the Samaritan.

Likewise at the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilot when Pilot offered to release either Jesus or the criminal Barabbus, the crowd chose Barabbus--despite the fact that there must have been many in that Passover crowd who had either witnessed healings by Jesus, knew of them, or been actual recipients. Yet they failed to make themselves heard--apparently from fear for their own skins.

It would seem then that miraculous cures do not make a solid foundation for a new religion. But they could, and apparently did, help to firm up the resolve of close followers, such as Jesus' apostles.

With Jesus' resurrection it is a different story. Firstly, could it have been a figment of the imagination? Paul provides the earliest surviving written account--one that was written within 20 years of Jesus' death:

"he was buried, and rose again on third day…and was seen of Peter, then of the twelve. After that he was seen by more than 500 at once, of whom the greater part remain unto the present, though some have died. After that he was seen of James, then of all the apostles. Last of all he was seen by me. (1 Corinthians 15:4-8)

Paul says that, besides the apostles, there were around 500 still living eye witnesses to the resurrection. Then he goes on to challenge the Corinthian audience to verify the resurrection for themselves by asking eye witnesses.

If we make a careful study of the accounts about the behavior of the apostles in the gospels, in Paul's epistles, and in Luke's Acts of the Apostles following on from the crucifixion and Pentecost we can hardly doubt that the successful establishment of the early Christian movement was very much dependent on the veracity of these eye witness assertions about the resurrection.

Likewise the change in behavior of the apostles from a cowardly set of deserters who fled and went into hiding after the crucifixion really does require something akin to the resurrection appearances for its explanation. Take away those appearances and we are at a loss to explain how Christianity could ever have became established as a major religion.

The incredible, almost logarithmic rate of spread of the Christian religion from Palestine via Syria and its neighbors, to Greece thence Rome and finally throughout the Roman Empire as far as Spain, Britain, and Ireland, demands explanation. What did this religion have that allowed it to displace virtually all others?

It could scarcely have been the ideas brought to our notice in the Sermon on the Mount (Matthew 5 & 6) for, though they attracted lip service, they had little popular appeal as an actual way of living. So what gave Christianity its enormous drawing power that allowed its proselytes to defy persecution, or even being fed to the lions in Roman amphitheatres?

Irrational fear of punishment by an offended deity for committed sin dates back a long way--at least 2,500 years to Zoroaster in Persia and to the 'mystery' religions. This fear had been brought back from the east by Roman soldiers and sailors and had become widespread by the time of Jesus' crucifixion.

Jesus' death and resurrection provided a ready-made means of allaying such fear if it was looked upon as having been a sacrificial offering to God in payment for the sins of mankind. Once this concept was put forward, the early Christians must have found it was tremendously successful in attracting new adherents--and this despite the built-in anomaly of promoting a God who is perfect love yet is also one who demands the sacrifice of death on the cross of his Son as an offering in payment for our sins!

The fact that this strange anomaly has remained firmly entrenched in all mainline Christian churches--yet unrecognised as even being an anomaly--is indicative of how firmly entrenched in the human psyche is the fear of divine punishment for unforgiven sin.

Summarizing this evidence we conclude that the veracity of Jesus' resurrection appearances was critical for the establishment of the early "Jesus movement"--but that the belief that Jesus' death on the cross as payment for our sins was of overriding importance for the establishment and continuing existence of Christianity.

# The Uniqueness of Jesus

From the commencement of his public ministry onwards to his crucifixion, Jesus' life was lived as a revelation of the nature of God and in accordance with the constraints imposed by the pact with Immanuel spelled out in Urantia Paper 120, pages 1325 to 1330.

Among these commitments we find Immanuel counselling: "that you assume, after you are sufficiently self-conscious of your divine identity, the additional task of technically terminating the Lucifer rebellion…." (1327)

And: "Exhibit in your one short life in the flesh, as it has never before been seen in all Nebadon, the transcendent possibilities attainable by a God-knowing human during the short career of mortal existence." (1325)

This phase of Jesus' life on Urantia commenced only after his baptism by John. Hence, it is to the social structure of Israel during the period of his post-baptismal public ministry that we must look in order to gain an understanding of what Jesus was seeking to demonstrate as a set of transcendent possibilities attainable by his followers.

The synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, inform us that the two major groups attempting to be models for a practicing Jew population were the Pharisees and the Saducees. Both groups claimed strict adherence to "The Law" as the dominating influence governing their life style. And both groups displayed virtually fanatic adherence to their interpretation of "The Law" as the correct way for a practicing Jew to live his life.

For the Pharisees and Saducees of 2000 years ago, this meant to follow the instructions contained in the "Torah," the first five books of the Old Testament, ostensibly written by Moses and claimed to be divine instruction from God himself. It included the 613 specific laws contained in those five books which defined almost every aspect of what it meant to be a Jew.

The Torah makes it clear that provided Jews live according to "the Law and the prophets," their God, Yahweh, will look after them. But if they disobey then Yahweh will unfailingly hand out suitable punishment.

Not only was Yahweh on the side of Moses and his Israelite adherents but he was heavy handed with anyone who opposed God's plan for them--which included being recipients of "the promised land."  This is illustrated in Deuteronomy 2 in which Moses states:

And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way, I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

Apparently this was an unreasonable request as Moses further states:

But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand.

Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at Jahaz. And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and his sons, and all his people. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we left none to remain--all of which, on modern standards, makes Moses and his Israelites a pitiless mob of murderers of women and children.

Og, the king of Bashan and the kings of the Amorites, their people and possessions suffered a similar fate to Sihon--but that was as nothing compared to the later victories of Joshua who was successor to Moses. Joshua's record of slaughter and dispossession included Jericho and its people, plus the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites--all under the guiding hand and protection of their God, Yahweh.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, Yahweh gave Moses the highly moral ten commandments which included not to commit adultery, not to steal, not to accuse another falsely, not to covet another's possessions, to respect your parents, and thou shall not kill.

How do we rationalize such commandments with what Moses and his Israelites did to Sihon, Og, and the kings of the Amorites plus all their subjects, or what the Joshua--Yahweh partnership subsequently did to the inhabitants of Canaan and Jericho--even to Yahweh holding back the sun in order to give Joshua time to kill off the rest of Jericho's inhabitants?

The only way to reconcile these conflicting behaviour patterns appears to be to conclude that Yahweh was God only of the Israelites, a God who rewarded them when they did as he asked, but punished them when they went astray. For the rest of mankind, Yahweh appears to have had absolutely no responsibility or regard.

We see this state of affairs hinted at in Jesus' day through Jesus' treatment of the Samaritan woman of Sychar, and through the parable of the good Samaritan. With the story of the Samaritan woman (John 4:7-27), when Jesus asks her for a drink, we discover that a Jew and Samaritan would not drink from the same vessel. Later in the same story we find that a practicing Jew would not even speak to a Samaritan woman.

In the parable of the good Samaritan, when asked by a lawyer, "who is my neighbour," Jesus told a story of a man going from Jerusalem to Jericho being set upon by robbers and left on the road half dead. First a priest, then a lawyer, see the man, apparently dead, and both pass by on the other side of the road, presumably through fear of defilement by the dead. Next comes a Samaritan who takes pity on the man, takes a closer look and finding him still alive, dresses his wounds, and takes him on his donkey to an inn. (Luke 10:25)

Jesus then turns to the lawyer who posed the question and asks, "which of the three acted like a neighbour?" To which the lawyer was forced to answer, "He who showed mercy."

Again in Matthew 8:5-13, Jesus heals the servant of Roman officer. And in selecting those who would become his apostles, he includes Matthew, a hated tax collector, a servant of Rome, and an outcast from Jewish society.

The Pharisees, in particular were fastidious about observing Torah Law. In seeking a reason to accuse Jesus, they kept watch to see if he would heal on the Sabbath. A man with a paralysed right arm was present in the synagogue. Jesus bade him come forward, then spoke to the Pharisees. "I ask you: what does our Law allow us to do on the Sabbath? To help or to harm? To save a man's life or to destroy it? Receiving no answer, he said to the man, "Stretch out your hand." He did so and his hand became well again. The Pharisees were filled with rage, asking among themselves what they could do to Jesus. (Luke 6:6-11)

In this and other instances we have seen that the Pharisees put rigid adherence to Torah Law ahead of the real needs of a human being. And because Jesus saw God as caring about what happened to human beings in history, he saw the culture of his Jewish society as something in need of far-reaching transformation, not something simply to be patched or legitimised.

Moses was deemed to have written the five books of the Torah, hence presents as one who gave complete approval for what today would be described as the barbarous acts of Yahweh against Israel's enemies.

In contrast Jesus presents as one who believed in the power of selfless spiritual love as the cure-all for human problems whether personal, social, national, or international. The fact that Christianity has failed to follow Jesus down this dominantly spiritual path is not because Jesus was mistaken. Rather it is because Christians have failed to understand Jesus' real teachings, and instead, have placed reliance in the erroneous concept that Jesus came to die as a sacrifice for the sins of the world as his most basic teaching.

Jesus did not come to die for us. He was killed because he threatened the status quo of the reigning Jewish hierarchy.

Some of the sayings of Jesus follow:

But I say unto you, Love your enemies, do good to them that hate you, bless them that curse you, pray for them which despitefully use you, and whatsoever you believe I would do to men, do you also unto them. (Luke 6:7; 6:33)

If your neighbor smites you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. Be willing to suffer injustice rather than to go to law among yourselves. In kindness and with mercy minister to all who are in distress and in need. (1571; Luke 6:29)


Judge not that you be not judged.


Jesus said: "But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, hoping for nothing in return; and your reward shall be great, and you shall be the children of the Most High God for he is kind unto the ungrateful and the wicked. (Luke 6:35)

One of the apostles once asked: "Master, what should I do if a stranger forced me to carry his pack for a mile?" Jesus answered: "Do not sit down and sigh for relief while you berate the stranger under your breath. Righteousness comes not from such passive attitudes. If you can think of nothing more effectively positive to do, you can at least carry the pack a second mile. (1770; Matthew 5:41) (Note: Roman soldiers in transit had the right to demand this service.)

Jesus said: "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, ( Luke 4:18)


Jesus spoke to them saying:
Blessed are they who know they are spiritually poor: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.
Blessed are the humble: for they shall inherit the earth.
Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness: for they shall be filled.
Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.
Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.
Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the children of God.
Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

Blessed are you, when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in heaven.

These sayings are meant to guide our transformation, and not to be converted into some kind of rigid legal system. Selflessness is the guiding principle that points the way to an alternative transformed culture--one which seeks to make the world more compassionate, one where individuals live at the borderland with the world of Spirit, and under the guidance of the Spirit.
