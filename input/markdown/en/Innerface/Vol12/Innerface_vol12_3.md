# “As Jesus Passed By”


Jesus spread good cheer everywhere he went. He was full of grace and truth. His associates never ceased to wonder at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. You can cultivate gracefulness, but graciousness is the aroma of friendliness which emanates from a love-saturated soul.

Goodness always compels respect, but when it is devoid of grace, it often repels affection. Goodness is universally attractive only when it is gracious. Goodness is effective only when it is attractive.

Jesus really understood men; therefore could he manifest genuine sympathy and show sincere compassion. But he seldom indulged in pity. While his compassion was boundless, his sympathy was practical, personal, and constructive. Never did his familiarity with suffering breed indifference, and he was able to minister to distressed souls without increasing their self-pity.

Jesus could help men so much because he loved them so sincerely. He truly loved each man, each woman, and each child. He could be such a true friend because of his remarkable insight--he knew so fully what was in the heart and in the mind of man. He was an interested and keen observer. He was an expert in the comprehension of human need, clever in detecting human longings.

Jesus was never in a hurry. He had time to comfort his fellow men “as he passed by.” And he always made his friends feel at ease. He was a charming listener. He never engaged in the meddlesome probing of the souls of his associates. As he comforted hungry minds and ministered to thirsty souls, the recipients of his mercy did not so much feel that they were confessing to him as that they were conferring with him. They had unbounded confidence in him because they saw he had so much faith in them.

He never seemed to be curious about people, and he never manifested a desire to direct, manage, or follow them up. He inspired profound self-confidence and robust courage in all who enjoyed his association. When he smiled on a man, that mortal experienced increased capacity for solving his manifold problems.

Jesus loved men so much and so wisely that he never hesitated to be severe with them when the occasion demanded such discipline. He frequently set out to help a person by asking for help. In this way he elicited interest, appealed to the better things in human nature.

The Master could discern saving faith in the gross superstition of the woman who sought healing by touching the hem of his garment. He was always ready and willing to stop a sermon or detain a multitude while he ministered to the needs of a single person, even to a little child. Great things happened not only because people had faith in Jesus, but also because Jesus had so much faith in them.

Most of the really important things which Jesus said or did seemed to happen casually, “as he passed by.” There was so little of the professional, the well-planned, or the premeditated in the Master's earthly ministry. He dispensed health and scattered happiness naturally and gracefully as he journeyed through life. It was literally true, “He went about doing good.”

And it behooves the Master's followers in all ages to learn to minister as “they pass by”--to do unselfish good as they go about their daily duties. (1874)

# Creationism, Evolution, and The Urantia Book
By Dick Bain


Evolution has been a bone of contention between science and religion ever since Darwin published his famous Origin of The Species in 1859.   Darwin must have had some inkling of the storm he was about to unleash on the world since he delayed publishing for a number of years. 

And what a storm it has been!  Sometimes the debate has become very heated, with the anti-evolutionists portraying the evolutionists as Godless humanists and the evolutionists portraying the anti-evolutionists as ignorant religious fanatics.  Biology teachers have had an especially difficult time since they teach the children of both groups, so they are right in the line of fire. 

The famous 1925 so-called “Scopes Monkey Trial” of John Scopes, a biology teacher, highlighted this issue.  Even though the trial was pre-arranged just to challenge the Tennessee law against teaching evolution, the intensity of the debate between attorneys Clarence Darrow and William Jennings Bryan during the trial illustrates the tension between the two sides of this issue. 

Since the authors of the papers comprising The Urantia Book portray both life and the universe as evolutionary, but not accidental, how will the various segments of our culture receive this book?

It seems to me that the evolutionary scheme of the Urantia Papers lies half way between the radical positions of strict evolutionist and radical anti-evolutionist. The strict evolutionist says that the origin of life is purely accidental and that the evolution of life is obviously a matter of natural selection. Natural selection, as defined by Darwin, says that new species occur because of the accumulation of small changes within a given species. The strict evolutionist says that appeal to a supernatural source is so much hubris. On the other hand, the anti-evolutionist usually objects to evolution on religious grounds. Their ideas are based on a literal interpretation of the Bible, in particular the well-known six days of creation portrayed in Genesis. The positions of these two groups are pretty well entrenched; neither one is liable to convince the other of the correctness of their position.

The creationists are immovable because they base their beliefs on the Bible, and for them the Bible is the “Word of God.”  Their attitude seems to be that if any part of the Bible was called into question, then it would cast doubt on the truth of the entire Bible. Therefore, so-called Creationist scientists look for evidence that will invalidate the theory of evolution and thereby prevent this theory from undermining people's belief in the Bible as the inspired Word of God. They are especially interested in getting school boards to replace the teaching of evolution with the teaching of creation science, or at least having creation science taught along with evolution as an alternative theory.

To further their agenda, they have endeavored to get those who believe the creationist doctrine elected to school boards so they could get biology books featuring creation science into the schools. They have had a few temporary victories in a few states (most recently Kansas,) but have not prevailed for long in most cases. In comparison, the strict evolutionist need not have such an agenda, since most high school biology texts already feature the story of evolution.

The evolutionist looks at the scientific evidence and sees what appears to be a series of evolutionary steps leading finally to us--Homo Sapiens. The evolutionist believes that life existed at least as long ago as 3 ½ billion years because evidence for bacteria has been found in rocks in Australia that scientists dated to that age.  Furthermore, many hardcore evolutionists believe that the origin of life is strictly accidental. They contend that given a few billion years of heat, lightning and cosmic radiation, existing hydrocarbon molecules will conglomerate in ever more complex associations until at last life will appear. Astronomers have found that the hydrocarbons needed to form life are found throughout the universe. No Creator is needed.  Is a compromise possible between the extremes of hardcore creationism and hardcore evolutionism?

There is a group of conservative Christians who promote an idea called “Intelligent Design.”  They present this as a compromise position, but is it?  The “Intelligent Design” folks contend that evolution may operate on a limited basis within a species, but that new species do not appear as a result of the accumulation of small changes as Darwin's concept of natural selection theorizes.  Many of these folks also accept that the earth is older than the 6000-year-old world promoted by the Creationists, but they do not accept a million-year existence for humans.  These folks, like the creationists, are trying to get their ideas taught along side of or as an alternative to evolution.  Because their position is less extreme than the creationists, they may have more success.  But they are certainly don't occupy the middle ground between the creationists and the evolutionists.  The strict evolutionists say that the “Intelligent Design” people are just Creationists in moderate's clothing.  But there is indeed a middle ground in our culture between the two extremes, though it hasn't been given a name.

Many liberal Christians and others feel that while the evidence does favor the evolution of species, nevertheless God must somehow be involved in the equation. They see God as the ultimate source of everything and as the creative mind behind this universe of things and beings. The crucial point is that many of them are open about the method God used to bring about his vision--evolution could be God's chosen mechanism.  Some scientists who are also spiritual persons seem to subscribe to this concept.  These liberal religionists and open-minded scientists are the sorts of people who might be open to the evolutionary concepts in the Urantia Papers.  Unfortunately, these middle-path people may not be a very large group.

In a recent issue of National Geographic [1], the author cites surveys showing that 44% of people polled believe that humanity and the earth are less than 10,000 years old. But the article goes on to say that probably many of these people are not Christian Evangelicals. Rather, the author faults the low level of scientific education within the U.S. for some of these incorrect beliefs. But at least those who lack an understanding of science may be educable and more open to new ideas than those whose minds are bound by a rigid system of beliefs. We might think that The Urantia Book would be an ideal textbook to educate the uninformed about evolution as God's chosen life building mechanism, but there are several problems with this idea.

While it contains some science information, the The Urantia Book is not a scientific text. It appears to me that its real purpose is to up-step our God concepts and present a more detailed and accurate picture of the life and teachings of Jesus than that presented in the Bible. The science in the The Urantia Book is a supporting actor rather than its star.  And further, as many of us have discovered, there are some problems with the science in the The Urantia Book, and this may include its presentation of evolution.  While the line of ascent from single cells to human beings presented in the book generally agrees with current theories, the times for certain events do not seem to agree with those determined by researchers. The authors tell us that the Life Carriers implanted single celled life here about 550 million years ago, yet scientists have found evidence for bacterial life (prokaryotes) at least 3 ½ billion years ago.

If we suppose that the authors are telling us that the single celled life they implanted was like our cells, with a DNA containing nucleus, the 550 million year figure is still somewhat questionable.  According to researchers, cells with a nucleus containing DNA (eukaryotes) appeared much later than bacteria--about 1 1/2 billion years ago according to some researchers. But if the life carriers implanted eukaryotes 550 million years ago, what was the source for the prokaryotes (bacteria) that already existed? Did they arise accidentally? Do the Life Carriers not consider bacteria to be a life form or are bacteria not life as they define it? Or is it possible that the Life Carriers implanted bacteria but gave us a figure that was more in line with the science of the 1930's?  In any case, the 550 million year figure may be a problem. [2]

Yet another problem with the scheme of the evolution of life in the The Urantia Book is that of sudden evolutionary steps. Classical Darwinian evolution specifies that changes happen gradually over long periods of time, whereas the authors of The Urantia Book state that new species appear suddenly. 58:6.3,5 [3]  However, there is a division within the ranks of scientists.  A few prominent ones such as the late Stephen Jay Gould, a well-known paleontologist, have put forward a theory called punctuated evolution.  They theorize that evolution of a new species does occur rapidly over a very short period of time. Considering this division, the sudden evolutionary steps affirmed in the book may not be so controversial with scientists.

Then there is the problem of life's ultimate source. While Christians may applaud the idea of God as the ultimate source of life, how will they respond to the idea of life implantation by a group of special beings known as Life Carriers?  And if we tout the The Urantia Book as a source of knowledge about evolution, biologists will surely ridicule our contentions, especially the idea of Life Carriers. How then shall we explain the The Urantia Book evolutionary concepts to the world in a way that many will find acceptable?


My feeling is that we need to deal with the concepts of evolution in the The Urantia Book just as we deal with other science in the book.  We can and should point out that the book fully supports the idea that the universe and life are shaped and advanced by evolution, but that the science of the book generally conforms to the level of science existing at the time the Papers were received in the 1930's. And I think we should make it very clear to potential readers that the authors emphasize that life is not an accident; its appearance is intentional and its ultimate source is God.  After all, God as a source of life and the universe is just as good a theory and maybe even better than an accidental genesis.  And while the idea of God having some helpers known as Life Carriers may seem strange at first, it isn't totally outrageous to think that God doesn't do everything himself. He uses both people and spiritual agencies to accomplish his ends.

I think that because the The Urantia Book is evolution friendly, it will appeal to many liberal folks, Christian and non-Christian alike. But I also believe that we need to emphasize the spiritual nature of the book and keep the science in its proper role of supporting actor.

# Why is it necessary for there to be error in The Urantia Book?
By Ken Glasziou

Introduction


At the very least there is a need to have certainty about the Urantia revelation--for if it has no errors of substance, it must be prophetic--and therefore carry divine authority. But if there are errors of substance, it becomes a decision of faith on the part of the individual to accept what they believe to be of value and to discard what they believe to be of no significant value.

For this important reason we first pose the question--are there errors of substance in the Urantia revelation? And in the next section we present what we believe to be incontrovertible evidence that there are such errors--and we discuss the reasons why they are there.


The Earth-Moon system: A comparison of The Urantia Book's version with that of modern science


On Page 655 of The Urantia Book we read:

“5,000,000,000 years ago your sun was a comparatively isolated blazing orb...” followed by:

“4,500,000,000 years ago the enormous Angona system began its approach to the neighborhood of this solitary sun….The effect was to draw out solar extrusions which evolved into the twelve planets of the sun.”

Modern science says nothing about the Angona system but agrees that the solar system was born during the 4.5 to 5.0 billion years ago interval. Then, on page 658, the Book states:

“3,000,000,000 years ago the solar system was functioning much as it does today. Its members continued to grow in size as space meteors continued to pour in upon the planets and their satellites at a prodigious rate.”

Modern science says that by this time, the rate at which space meteors poured in upon the earth-moon system had fallen enormously and no longer contributed significantly to their rate of increase of mass.

“2,500,000,000 years ago the planets had grown immensely in size. Urantia was a well developed sphere about one tenth its present mass and was still growing rapidly by meteoric accretion.”

And at the top of Urantia Book page 659 it is stated:

“2,000,000,000 years ago the earth began decidedly to gain on the moon. Always had the planet been larger than its satellite but there was not so much difference in size until about this time, when enormous space bodies were captured by the earth. Urantia was then about one fifth its present size.”

Previously, Urantia Book readers disagreed about whether these last two paragraphs really mean that the earth and moon were about the same size (mass) until 2,000,000,000 years ago. Modern isotopic analysis shows that both sides of this disagreement were incorrect as the earth and  the moon had actually reached almost their full size and mass by about 4,600,000,000 years ago.

Proof that the moon had virtually ceased all growth by the 4 billion years ago mark is provided in the illustration below. Further down on page 659 is:
"1,500,000,000 years ago the earth was two thirds its present size, while the moon was nearing its present mass….Volcanic activity is now at its height. The whole earth is a veritable

fiery inferno…."

Modern science finds no evidence to support  these assertions. And 3 paragraphs further down:

“Presently the atmosphere became more settled and cooled sufficiently to start precipitation of rain on the hot rocky surface of the planet. For thousands of years Urantia was enveloped in one vast and continuous blanket of steam. And during these ages the sun never shone upon the earth's surface.”

There is much contrary evidence to this statement which will be covered later.

Lastly on paragraph 3 of page 660 we have:

“1,000,000,000 years ago is the date of the actual beginning of Urantia history. The planet has attained approximately its present size.”

The Urantia Book statement on page 656 that our planetary system first evolved 4,500,000,000 years ago is remarkably close to the deduction from radiometric data carried out in 1955 by C.C. Patterson using the lead isotopes in chondritic meteoric materials which put their age at 4.5 billion years. Later, Patterson also put the age of our planet at 4.56 billion years.

Patterson's figure was verified as being close to reality when the latest radiometric techniques were applied to the 382 kilograms of moon rocks comprised of 2415 individual samples brought back by the Apollo program to the moon from 1969 onwards. Further samples were also available from the Russian moon program. The oldest moon rock among these samples was found to be nearly 4.6 billion years which is just about as old as the oldest Earth rocks. These studies included the use of oxygen isotope ratios on both moon and earth rocks which demonstrated that the Earth and its moon have a common ancestry--that is they are constructed from the same pool of source materials.

In the paragraph covering the 2,000,000,000 to 1,500,000,000 years period the Urantia Papers' authors (here the Life Carriers) inform us: “The radium clock is your most reliable time piece for making scientific estimates of the age of the planet…” (note: uranium to lead is now the preferred clock)

This finally turned out to be a truly prophetic statement but not until such time as zircon crystals, plus advanced technology such as the use of ion probes towards the end of the second millennium A.D., permitted the construction of the history of individual zircons to be revealed with an unprecedented accuracy of one million in three billion1 years. In many cases this same history could be used to clarify much more than just the history of the zircon.

Conclusions drawn with the aid of isotopic and geophysical data are:

1. The moon is not a primordial object; it is an evolved terrestrial planet with internal zoning similar to that of the Earth.

Before Apollo the state of the moon was a subject of almost unlimited speculation. We now know that the moon is made of rocky material that has been variously melted, erupted through volcanoes, and crushed by meteorite impacts. It possess a thick crust (60 km), a fairly uniform lithosphere (60--1000 km), and a partly liquid asthenosphere (1000-1740 km); a small iron core at the bottom of the asthenosphere is possible but unconfirmed.. Some rocks give hints for ancient magnetic fields although no planetary field exists today.

2. The moon is ancient and still preserves an early history (the first billion years) that must be common to all terrestrial planets.   

The extensive record of meteorite craters on the moon, when calibrated using absolute ages of rock samples, provides a key for unraveling time scales for the geologic evolution of Mercury, Venus, and Mars based on their individual crater records.

3. The oldest moon rocks are virtually as old as the oldest Earth rocks. The earliest processes and events that probably affected both planetary bodies can now only be found on the moon.

Moon rock ages range from about 3.2 billion years in the maria (dark solidified lava plains) to nearly 4.6 billion years in the light rugged highlands.

4. The moon and Earth are genetically related and formed from different proportions of a common reservoir of materials.

The distinctively similar oxygen isotopic compositions of moon rocks and Earth rocks clearly show common ancestry. Relative to Earth, however, the moon is highly depleted in iron and in volatile elements that are needed to form atmospheric gases and water.

5. All moon rocks originated through high-temperature processes with little or no involvement with water. They are roughly divisible into three types: basalts, anorthosites, and breccias.

6. The lunar magma ocean was followed by a series of large asteroid impacts that created basins which were later filled by lava flows.

The large, dark basins such as Mare Imbrium are gigantic impact craters, formed early in lunar history, that were later filled by lava flows about 3.2-3.9 billion years ago. Lunar volcanism occurred mostly as lava floods that spread horizontally; volcanic fire fountains produced deposits of orange and emerald-green glass beads.

7. The lunar highlands were formed 4.4-4.6 billion years ago by flotation of an early, feldspar-rich crust on a magma ocean that covered the moon to a depth of many tens of kilometers. Innumerable meteorite impacts through geologic time reduced much of the ancient crust to mountain ranges between basins.

8. Little has occurred on the moon since about 3 billion years ago; after the volcanic fires died the only activity has been the occasional formation of an impact crater and the constant rain of micrometeorites.

9. Since the Apollo missions there have been two fly-by visits in the early 1990's by the Jupiter-bound Galileo space craft which, using spectral filters to map the moon surface, noted the presence of high iron rocks in the floor of the South Pole-Aitkin basin. Further visits were made in 1994 by the spacecraft Clementine which orbited the moon for 71 days and obtained a complete global map of the lunar surface in 11 wavelengths. Later, the Lunar Prospector in 1998 mapped the moon's surface composition using gamma-ray and neutron spectroscopy. Both found evidence for water ice at the poles.

Numbers 7 and 8 above illustrate the enormous difference between The Urantia Book's account of earth-moon relationships during their construction phase and that formulated from scientific investigations. The Urantia Book has the earth and the moon following a parallel pathway of growth through the 2.5 billion years ago period but diverging at 2.0 billion years ago when the Earth captured “enormous space bodies.” In contrast, modern science has utilized advanced techniques to produce a picture in which both the earth and the moon utilized the same pool of building materials in a process (the accumulation of mass) that was virtually complete for each around 4.6 billion years ago.

For the moon, volcanic activity and lava flow continued until 3.2 billion years ago, after which activity ceased other than for occasional collisions with meteorites.

This was a time at which The Urantia Book claims building activity for both earth and moon had hardly commenced. (The Urantia Book says 2.5 billion years ago the earth was 1/10th its present mass.)


The world ocean and the first continent


According to The Urantia Book between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago the “whole earth was a veritable fiery inferno” towards the end of which “for thousands of years Urantia was enveloped in a continuous blanket of steam” through which “the sun never shone upon the earth's surface.” This, the Book states, was the time of appearance of the first primitive ocean and the formation of sediments on the ocean floor. However because there was no free oxygen in the atmosphere, these early oceanic deposits were devoid of “colored stones or shales.” (660) Presumably this comment refers to the absence of iron salts in their ferric (oxidized) form which are from red to reddish-brown.
But according to modern science the reality was entirely different. Colored sedimentary deposits that originated in oceans are dated to be at least 2.5 billion years old and as a result of oxygenation of the ocean waters through photosynthesis.1 Stromatolites that are formed in the shallow oceans may be up to thirty meters thick and ten meters high--and are the product of 	
colonies of living organisms. Foremost among these are the photosynthetic Cyanacae bacteria often wrongly called blue-green algae. Some stromatolites are dated to go back as far as 3.9 billion years ago, and analysis of zircons from sedimentary rocks in Western Australia place ocean formation beyond 4.3 billion years ago6,7--a conclusion in line with the dating of oceanic stromatolites of 3.9 billion years ago.

Another group of organisms are called the Ediacarans, named after the mountain range in South Australia where their fossil remains were first found. In the fossilized crawling trails of sea-bottom-dwelling worm-like creatures that date back close to 1 billion years ago, the Ediacarans provide the first unequivocal evidence of more highly developed life forms than the bacteria. All Ediacarans were sea dwelling forms. One type, Charniodiscus had a holdfast to anchor it to the sea bed and a leaf-like structure that grew to about 10 feet in length. Others used dwelling tubes composed of calcium carbonate (lime) and were most probably sessile, filter feeding worm-like creatures. Though very primitive, some of these animals are now believed to have possessed muscles, internal organs, and head and tail regions.

Prior to 1.0 billion years ago, life consisted of prokaryotes, single cell bacteria that do not have their DNA protected in a cell nucleus plus eukaryote bacteria that do. The prokaryotes came into being almost 4 billion years ago. The eukaryotes may have come into being as far back as 2.7 billion years. The evidence for this is the occurrence of steranes in the shales of Western Australia. These are hydrocarbon molecules that are produced exclusively by eukaryotic organisms. Fossils from other eukaryotic organisms such as Eosphaera and Huraniospora are dated at 1.9 billion years ago.

None of these organisms could have survived that interval between 1.5 and 1.0 billion years ago when The Urantia Book says the sun failed to “shine upon the earth's surface for thousands of years.” So either this failure simply did not happen or else life was created for a second time. Also the evidence provided by the stromatolites for continuity of the world's oceans since more than 4 billion years ago is either false or else The Urania Book's claim of the primitive ocean first occurring towards the conclusion of the 1.5 to 1.0 billion years ago interval is false.

Whereas there is a wealth of evidence to support the conclusion of early oceans existing 4 billion years ago and for the life forms that lived therein, there is no physical evidence to support The Urantia Book's version of the first primitive ocean occurring just over 1 billion years ago nor for the assertion that its appearance was preceded by “thousands of years” when the “sun never shone on the earth's surface.”

To ask readers of The Urantia  Book to believe this unsupported evidence in the face of verified scientific evidence to the contrary is akin to the demand of many fundamentalist Christians to believe that both the Old and the New testaments are the absolute word of God--and therefore that Noah really did pack one pair of all the world's animal species into his arc, that the whale really did swallow Jonah and vomit him up three days later on dry land, that God did hold the sun stationary in the sky thus providing the light allowing Joshua to kill off the Amorites, the enemies of his chosen people!

That brings us to the Life Carriers 550 million years ago and their introduction of “life” to Urantia. There is almost a surfeit of evidence for what both scientists and laymen call “life” throughout time almost to the birth of our planet more than 4 billion years ago. The presence of stromatolites at that time is overwhelming evidence that life was also already present--and because of the complexity of “life,” even considerably earlier. All stromatolites are formed by colonies of organisms, at least one of which was photosynthetic in order to provide an energy source for the colony. The minimum requirement for such an organism is that it could reproduce itself, as well as synthesize a complex organic system capable of trapping sunlight energy (photosynthesis) and making it available in a form the organism could use.

What is the likelihood that such an organism came together simply by chance? All living organisms currently on earth utilize a multitude of different proteins to carry out their vital functions. There is no good reason to believe that an organism we call “living” has ever done anything else. Proteins consist of amino acids strung together in a specific sequence that has for a template, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)--which consists of a string of simpler molecules called nucleotides. Each amino acid requires three nucleotides to specify its place in the string that forms a protein molecule. What are the chances for that template DNA being strung together correctly to specify a single medium size protein? Calculation puts this at one chance in 10150   ---an impossibly slight chance.

A single protein molecule could not generate a self-reproducing, functional, living organism able to synthesize and operate a photosynthetic unit such as does the Cyanacae bacterium.

A human being is thought to have about 25,000 genes and between 80,000 and 100,000 functional protein molecules.2 The complexity of putting together a self-reproducing, photosynthetic Cyanacae cell would certainly require hundreds if not thousands of unique protein molecules. To do so by some kind of random selection of amino-acid sequence for its protein molecules is just not a possibility. Hence it appears that the Life Carriers were operative on Urantia way back more than 4 billion years ago. For reasons of their own, they simply have not told us about the real commencement of life on this planet.

It is quite apparent that Urantia required billions of years of planned preparation prior to introduction of higher life forms than the prokaryote bacteria. One reason was the need for an appropriate mixture of oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and also an ozone layer to protect life forms from the harmful rays of ultraviolet light from the sun.

The limiting factor for the increase of atmospheric oxygen appears to have been the level of soluble iron salts dissolved in the ocean water. These had to be oxidized by the oxygen from photosynthesis, likewise dissolved in the ocean water, to the insoluble ferric form before that oxygen could be released into the atmosphere. These reddish-brown, fully oxidized, sedimentary rocks were laid down up to the 1.7 to 1.8 billion years ago interval. Younger rocks have the characteristics of having formed in an oxygen rich atmosphere and thus provide evidence for the function of life--the photosynthetic Cyanacae bacteria--in the evolution of our planet and its atmosphere.1 Land plants, now the major contributors of oxygen to our atmosphere, did not appear until about half a billion years ago.

On page 660, The Urantia Book has: “Even in the later periods the continuing lava flows and the incoming meteors kept the oxygen of the air almost completely used up. Even the early deposits of the soon appearing primitive ocean contain no colored stones or shales. And for a long time after this ocean appeared, there was virtually no free oxygen in the atmosphere; and it did not appear in significant quantities until it was later generated by the seaweeds and other forms of vegetable life.”

Modern science has the oceans appearing around 4 billion years ago, and the colored oceanic sediments disappearing by 1.7 billion years ago due to the presence of oxygen from bacterial photosynthesis. The Urantia Book's account has the first ocean appearing at 1 to 1.5 billion years ago and oxygen appearing in our atmosphere only after the Life Carriers' implantation of life forms 550 million years ago.

All the information so far contained in this article is available in current popular science journals as well as being accessible through internet search facilities.4,5

Only recently, with the aid of advanced technology, have we had an account of earth-moon relationships and early earth history in which we can have real confidence. And now that we have it we must accept that most of the account given by the Life Carriers for this earth-moon period prior to 550 million years ago is simply incorrect. Moreover, the Life Carriers who wrote this account must have known it is incorrect.

How can we explain such error in a revelation? The real answer to that question is to read all of the revelation and to discover what it really says.

What the Urantia Revelation really says! Why is there error in The Urantia Book?


One answer is that because there are definite limitations to revelation--some of which are set out under the heading of The Limitations of Revelation on page 1109 of Paper 100:

“Because your world is generally ignorant of origins, even of physical origins, it has appeared to be wise from time to time to provide instruction in cosmology. And always has this made trouble for the future. The laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge. Any cosmology presented as a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short time. Accordingly, future students of such a revelation are tempted to discard any element of genuine religious truth it may contain because they discover errors on the face of the associated cosmologies therein presented.” (1109)

If this statement is taken exactly as it was written then surely no Urantia Book reader should be surprised when they discover errors in the Book's cosmology?

The revelation continues with: “Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors. We are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand years. Revelators must act in accordance with the instructions which form a part of the revelation mandate. We see no way of overcoming this difficulty, either now or at any future time. We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records.” (1109)

And at the bottom of page 1109 the revelators conclude with, “statements with reference to cosmology are never inspired.” What else can “never inspired” mean other than that their cosmology is “never infallible?”

Interpreted literally then, we should expect that where it was necessary to provide continuity in some area of the sciences, the revelators would be forced to include material that, though not factual, would nevertheless act as a stop-gap until such time as our science caught up.

On page 1260, such stop-gap material is termed a “framework in which to think:”

“Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a universe frame in which to think.”

And in the next paragraph, “Conceptual frames of the universe are only relatively true; they are serviceable scaffolding which must eventually give way before the expansions of enlarging cosmic comprehension.”

There appears to be very little, if any, of the erroneous science in earth-moon relations that is not covered by these statements.

Our God-given free will is sacrosanct!

Another answer to why there is error--in fact why there must be error in the Urantia Papers--is that God has given us free will. Hence to provide us with a revelation that is infallible and demonstrably free of all error would surely place a severe strain upon our liberty to choose to either believe or not to believe that revelation.

“No personal creature can be coerced into the eternal adventure; the portal of eternity opens only in response to the freewill choice of the freewill sons of the God of free will.” (71)

“No other being, force, creator, or agency in all the wide universe of universes can interfere to any degree with the absolute sovereignty of the mortal free will, as it operates within the realms of choice, regarding the eternal destiny of the personality of the choosing mortal. As pertains to eternal survival, God has decreed the sovereignty of the material and mortal will, and that decree is absolute.” (71)

“Free will is supreme in moral affairs, even God's indwelling Spirit refuses to compel any individual to think a single thought or to perform a single act against the choosing of their own will.” (753)

The need for uncertainty

“…it would be a colossal blunder for the creature to know the future. They heighten man's taste for the sweetness of uncertainty, for the romance and charm of the indefinite and unknown future.” (438)

“But long before reaching Havona, these ascendant children of time have learned to feast upon uncertainty, to fatten upon disappointment, to enthuse over apparent defeat, to invigorate in the presence of difficulties, to exhibit indomitable courage in the face of immensity, and to exercise unconquerable faith when confronted with the challenge of the inexplicable. Long since, the battle cry of these pilgrims became: ”In liaison with God, nothing--absolutely nothing--is impossible." (291)

“Uncertainty with security is the essence of the Paradise adventure--uncertainty in time and in mind, uncertainty as to the events of the unfolding Paradise ascent; security in spirit and in eternity, security in the unqualified trust of the creature son in the divine compassion and infinite love of the Universal Father; uncertainty as an inexperienced citizen of the universe; security as an ascending son in the universe mansions of an all-powerful, all-wise, and all-loving Father.” (1223)


Conclusions


And so we conclude that during our earthly career we are expected--are destined--to live with error and uncertainty. And faith is our ultimate need. For that is God's way.

“Jesus laid great emphasis upon what he called the two truths of first import in the teachings of the kingdom, and they are: the attainment of salvation by faith and faith alone, associated with the revolutionary teaching of the attainment of human liberty through the sincere recognition of truth, 'you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free.'” (1593)

The occurrence of error in The Urantia Book gives us no option other than to make our decision about it, “by faith and faith alone.” Associated is the recognition that such truth can truly set us free.

# Is The Urantia Book Believable? Is it Logical?

By Dick Bain



If we were showing The Urantia Book to someone for the first time, could we convince that person that the major concepts are logical and believable?   Why do some people believe something like The Urantia Book, and others reject it?  Does logic dictate what we believe?  Why is one person a skeptic and another a fundamentalist?


Total acceptance vs. skepticism


I observe that people have differing levels of tolerance for uncertainty.  Those with the least tolerance wish to have a source of truth they feel is complete and infallible.  This characteristic may lead such folks to seek a guru or join a community of like-minded people.  The in-group mentality may then strongly reinforce the person's belief in the holy book, religion, or “ism” embraced by the group.  And then there are those at the other end of the spectrum.

Some people seem to be natural born skeptics; they take nothing for granted, and nothing is exempt from questioning.  They are often quite well educated; many of those who labor in the fields of science and engineering fall in this category.  These are the sorts of persons the authors of The Urantia Book had in mind when they said, “If such a metamorphosis could not be seen, a scientist would be inclined to deny the possibility of developing a butterfly out of a caterpillar.” [42:9.4]  These persons may feel that all religion is a product of culture and has no basis in reality, or like Karl Marx they may feel that religion is “the opiate of the masses.”  Fortunately, most of us fall somewhere between the two extremes of total gullibility and total skepticism.  Many of us can believe without giving up our ability to question and we generally retain the flexibility to examine our beliefs as we mature and adjust them if we find a better alternative.  In addition to our need to believe and our critical thinking abilities, we also bring both our culture and our inherited tendencies to our study of The Urantia Book, and these help determine whether or not we will believe the concepts presented in the book.


Influences on Beliefs


What we believe is strongly influenced by who we are, and who we are is shaped by both heredity and environment.  A few researchers have decided that we are apparently born with the need to believe in a transcendent being such as God. (1)  According to the authors of The Urantia Book, we are also born with a need for a meaningful structure:  “If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates.” [115:1.2]  We are also born with a need for social acceptance.  The nurture side of the equation is just as powerful in shaping us as is the nature side.   Our initial impression of the world comes from our relationship with our parents.  Later on, friends, authority figures, and others share their culture with us and we are indelibly marked by these influences.  But these aren't the only influences.

The authors of The Urantia Book tell us that the Spirit of Truth works in our minds to help us discern spiritual truth.  If we all have this marvelous helper working within us, why don't we all believe the book?  Is the problem with us, or the book?  I think that there are a number of reasons that some people reject the book.  One obvious reason is the bundle of preconceived notions and beliefs we bring to our study of it.  If we are Christians, we might reject anything that disagrees with any part of the Bible or Christian theology.  At the other extreme, we might reject the book because it seems too Christian.  I recall showing The Urantia Book to a minister and theology professor who had left his mainline Christian church to join a Unity church after he retired.  He said that he didn't want to read the book because he had long ago rejected some Christian theology and didn't want to revisit that decision.  Others might be frightened by the size or content of the book.  These are people who may also be frightened when someone starts talking about the vastness of the universe; they are frightened by the immensity of it all.  But are there some logical reasons not to believe the book?

Let's be honest.  Some of the ideas in The Urantia Book seem rather strange when we are first exposed to them.  Some have said that it's a bit hard to swallow the idea of fandors, or people having invisible children, or all the colored races originating in one family, or the complex spiritual administration in charge of the universe.  A person once told me that he couldn't believe that heaven was so organized; he apparently believed that God did all the work himself.  Other people may be put off by some inaccuracies in the science concepts in the book.  The authors addressed this problem:  “Any cosmology presented as a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short time. Accordingly, future students of such a revelation are tempted to discard any element of genuine religious truth it may contain because they discover errors on the face of the associated cosmologies therein presented.”  [101:4.1]

Belief and Logic


The authors of The Urantia Book tell us that belief is more a function of mind than of spirit.  When we believe The Urantia Book, we decide to accept its concepts and historical presentations as true.  But belief isn't the same as logic.  We tend to believe that which we find logical, but not everything we believe is necessarily logical.  In fact, beliefs may totally fly in the face of logic.  This doesn't necessarily mean they're wrong, but that they aren't amenable to logical analysis.  This doesn't mean that we have to abandon logic; it is a powerful tool.  Shouldn't logic support our beliefs whenever possible?

Beliefs, like birds, come in many varieties.  But not all beliefs can be analyzed with logic.  I would categorize beliefs and their relation to logic as follows:

1.Irrational beliefs: If you believe that you have a horn growing out of the middle of your forehead, and you obviously don't, most people would say that belief is irrational and illogical.  No amount of logic will convince people that you actually have a horn growing out of your forehead.  You probably need some time on a psychiatrist's couch.

2. Non-rational beliefs: If I say, “I have experienced God in my inner life,” this is not a statement that can be analyzed with logic to determine its truthfulness or lack thereof.  This is true of most subjective experiences.

3. Rational beliefs: These beliefs can be supported by logic.  If I say that I believe there is life elsewhere in the universe, we can apply logic and discuss the reasons we there might or might not be intelligent life elsewhere.  I can point out, as I do later in this article, that there seem to be planets around most stars, and that life has been found in many difficult environments, and therefore life elsewhere in the universe seems very likely.

But even a belief that can be supported with logic can be a minefield for discussion.

Belief is such a personal thing, so colored by our histories and personalities; beliefs often evoke strong emotions.  If I attack your belief, I may be attacking something you learned at your mother's knee, and by implication attacking your mother.  Perhaps asking if The Urantia Book is believable isn't the best question to ask.  Maybe it would be better to ask questions that engage the logical parts of our minds: Do reasonable, normal people find The Urantia Book credible and logical?  But before we can discuss the credibility of The Urantia Book, there is a preliminary matter we need to settle.


Premises Needed for Debate


When philosophers sit down to debate, there are some premises called a priori concepts or first principles that all must agree upon.  These first principles are accepted without debate to provide a starting point for discussion.  As the authors of the Urantia Papers express it, “Both science and religion start out with the assumption of certain generally accepted bases for logical deductions.” [101:5.8]  The existence of God is a first principle on which we need to agree.  The authors state, “The existence of God can never be proved by scientific experiment or by the pure reason of logical deduction.” [1:2.5]  They also say, “In the mortal state, nothing can be absolutely proved; both science and religion are predicated on assumptions.” [103:7.2]

I suggest that the precepts with which we need to agree to begin a discussion about The Urantia Book are these: first, the existence of God; second, a God who is a personal being with whom we can have a personal relationship; and third, a God who is also the ground of all being, as theologian Paul Tillich defined God. Note that the existence and goodness of God was always assumed in Jesus teachings.  “He never asked men to believe in his Father; he took it for granted they did.” [169:4.3] 

As the authors of The Urantia Book tell us, “How can the finite mind of man achieve a logical, true, and corresponding unity of thought? This universe-knowing state of mind can be had only by conceiving that the quantitative fact and the qualitative value have a common causation in the Paradise Father.” [133:5.8]  If we do not accept these fundamental ideas, then there is hardly any basis for discussion.  If we do, then we can debate the reasonableness of some ideas and concepts in The Urantia Book.

The Logic of Some Major Concepts in The Urantia Book


If God is a personal being with whom we can have a relationship, then what sort of relationship is it?   The authors of The Urantia Book and most of us I think would agree that love is the most meaningful and profound of relationships between two persons.  Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that God's greatest aspect is love, and that as Jesus portrayed him, God loves us as would a father love his children.  And because God is at the highest level of reality and we are at the lowest level, is it not logical that God would find a way to bridge that gap?  Of course, we do have the ministry of the descending sons and children of the Infinite Spirit, but God chooses to minister to us directly.  He has the ultimate way to bridge that gap; he has sent a very part of himself to dwell in us, to be with us as we struggle with life's challenges, and if we will accept it, to guide us, even finally into the presence of God himself. He has sent us himself as a Thought Adjuster.  Therefore, I find the existence and ministry of Thought Adjusters both reasonable and logical.  But what of all the other types of spiritual beings and all those different levels?  Is all that logical?

How is it that “Heaven” can be so organized with all sorts of beings and so many levels of progress for us?  If God does not personally do everything that gets done in the universe, then obviously someone else has to do it.  I like to think of God as the ultimate executive; he delegates both as much responsibility and as much authority as he is able to others.  And at each level of the spiritual universe of beings, this is the ideal pattern for keeping the whole enterprise moving in the direction of God's ultimate vision for the universe.  If there were only one inhabited planet as most people used to believe, then things could be much simpler.  But now that over 120 planets have been discovered orbiting other stars, it is evident that many, perhaps even the majority of stars have a planet in orbit around them.  With at least 200 billion stars in our galaxy, it is hard to believe that ours is the only planet with intelligent life.  In fact, I think that it is the ultimate of geocentric arrogance to believe that this vast universe was created just to support one small, inhabited planet out on the edge of a great galaxy, which is only one of perhaps 100 billion other galaxies.  It seems logical to me that not just the earth but also the entire universe is intended by God to be occupied; otherwise, why make it so expansive?  If there are as many inhabited planets as the authors tell us there are, then there is needed a vast organization with numerous types of spirit workers to oversee this huge enterprise.  There are a lot of beings to be kept track of, guided, and educated, not just in their material existence, but also in the rest of their universe career.   So to me, all those personalities and levels of progress make sense.  But progress in the next life implies that there is a next life.  Is the idea of personality survival reasonable and logical?

The authors of The Urantia Book inform us, “Nature does not afford ground for logical belief in human-personality survival.”  [101:2.8]  Is survival of some aspect of ourselves a reasonable idea?  Many cultures have a concept similar to that of a soul, and many have a concept of survival beyond this life.  As the authors tell us, this is not something for which anyone can offer any sort of reliable proof.  But is it illogical?  As I observe our lives, it seems to me that most of us are an unfinished product when we leave here.  This earthly experience seems to be a preparation for another step forward on another level.  Another thought I've had is that if we accept the reality of a personal, loving God, then he would want to have his spirit children continue progressing until they have achieved their potential.  Furthermore, it seems unfair to many people that lives are shortened by disease, accident or war--especially the lives of children.  Then in the spirit of fairness and justice, it seems reasonable and logical to me that there is a next life where we can continue our progress and make up for opportunities lost in this life.

The Urantia Book has a great deal to say about our path of progression in the next phase of our eternal life, the morontia career.  The authors speak of a great many levels through which we progress on our journey to Paradise.  This idea of incremental progress does not seem to be a part of orthodox Christian theology.  The traditional idea is that we die and either go to Heaven or Hell.  If we make it to Heaven, we are instantly made perfect, regardless of our status at the time we made our transition.  But consider:  That is nothing like the lives we lead here.  We progress in steps from one grade to the next higher one in school, or we progress from apprentice to skilled worker to master craftsperson in our work.  We do not expect a first grader to solve complex trigonometric problems, nor do we expect a beginner to perform at the level of an athlete with years of training.  It seems logical for us to have the chance to progress at a measured pace, to learn to walk before we are required to fly.  Another reason I can see for the intervening morontia life is the comfort factor.

When we awake on the mansion worlds, we will have a body and mind that are far advanced from the ones we have here, but they will retain some familiar features.  For instance, we will still eat food and communicate with speech.  Since we retain some idea of who we were and what we were, it seems like a good idea to make our transition to the next life somewhat familiar.  That way, we will find similarity to our previous lives and have a less traumatic experience.  It seems to me that this scheme of small transitions from one level to another reflects divine wisdom and is both reasonable and logical.

Dealing With Problematic Details


There are a great number of other areas that could be examined for reasonableness and logic, but hopefully the examples given are adequate to suggest that the major ideas in The Urantia Book are both reasonable and logical if we accept the existence of a loving, personal God. And because the major concepts in the book are logical and reasonable, many open-minded people will find much of the book believable.  Of course we need to be honest with those to whom we introduce the book.  There are things in The Urantia Book that appeared to be correct at the time the papers were printed but have since been discovered to be outdated or erroneous, particularly in the area of science.

When we introduce people to The Urantia Book, we need to avoid setting up unrealistic expectations.  If we lead folks to expect a revelation that is perfect in all respects, we may set them up to reject the book and set ourselves up for disappointment.  But we can certainly promote the major concepts in the book as reasonable and logical.  Problems with some details of the book do not invalidate its great spiritual insights or its potential to uplift the spiritual status of our lives and that of our world.  And after all, neither our eternal destiny nor our faith relationship with our spirit Father hinge upon total belief in a book or having absolute truth.

Religion is not the product of reason, but viewed from within, it is altogether reasonable. Religion is not derived from the logic of human philosophy, but as a mortal experience it is altogether logical.  [101:1.4]
