# The Historical Jesus--
Who was He?
From "The Essential Jesus" 2002, (Ed. B.W. Ball and W.G. Johnson) (Pacific Press, Idaho)

There are relatively few references to Jesus in non-Christian sources over the first two centuries A.D. One historian explains this reality in these words: "Jesus was a marginal Jew leading a marginal movement in a marginal province of the vast Roman empire."

Fortunately however, both Jewish and pagan literature does contain significant references that bear upon the veracity of the biblical record of Jesus' existence. And this record was not just a figment of the imagination of overly zealous followers.

Among Jewish sources the writings of the historian, Josephus, who lived from A.D. 37 to 100 are among the best known and historically reliable.

In discussing the rule of the Jewish high priest, Ananus, Josephus mentions in Book 20 of his "Jewish Antiquities" that to an assembly of the Jewish ruling body, the Sanhedrin, "He (Ananus) assembled the Sanhedrin of the judges, and brought before them James, the brother of Jesus, who was called Christ, and some others, and when he had formed an accusation against them as law breakers, he delivered them to be stoned."

Josephus was not writing about Jesus or Christians; he was merely setting the stage for the story of the deposition of Ananus. James was a common Jewish name. Some identification was needed; thus Josephus designated James as the brrother of Jesus, who was also called Christ.

The mention of Jesus is incidental but its mention is intact in all Greek sources of Josephus' history and is accepted by virtually all scholars as being authentic.

In his Antiquities, Book 18, in writing about Pontius Pilate, the Procurator of Judea, Josephus makes further mention of Jesus. "Now there was about this time, Jesus, a wise man for he was the doer of wonderful works, and a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the gentiles. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; and the tribe of Christians, so named after him are not extinct at this day."

An analysis of these two passages from Josephus' Antiquities indicates that they were not later interpolations, that he did actually mention Jesus and even though they were "in passing" references, Josephus clearly acknowledged the historicity of Jesus.

Non-Jewish sources--Mara bar Sarapion

An original letter dated A.D. 73 and written by a Syrian Stoic held in a Roman prison is one of the earliest non-Christian references to Jesus. Written to his son to extol the virtue of wisdom, the writer, Mara Bar Sarapion, states as follows:

"What good did it do to the Athenians to kill Socrates, for which deed they were punished with famine and pestilence? What did it avail the Samians to burn Pythagorus, since their country was entirely buried under sand in one moment? Or what did it avail the Jews to kill their wise king, since their kingdom was taken from them from that time on?

"God justly avenged these three wise men. The Athenians died of famine, the Samians were flooded by the sea, the Jews were slaughtered and driven from their kingdom, everywhere living in the dispersion. (Jerusalem was sacked by Rome in A.D. 70)

"Socrates is not dead, thanks to Plato; nor Pythagoras, because of Hera's statue. Nor is the wise king, because of the new law he has given."

Although Mara does not mention Jesus by name, there is little doubt that he had him in mind. It would also seem that his information came from Christian sources such as the synoptic Gospels.

Pliny the Younger

Shortly after the beginning of the second century, a Roman named Pliny became the governor of the Roman provinces of Bithnia and Pontus. He conducted extensive correspondence with Rome regarding his official duties, one of his problems being what to do with Christians about whom he wrote:

"In investigations of Christians I have never taken part; hence I do not know what is the crime usually punished or investigated, or what allowances are made….I have asked them if they are Christians, and if they admit it, I repeat the question a second or third time, with a warning of the punishment awaiting them."

He further wrote that anyone accused of being a Christian could either refute the charges by offering incense to the Gods and the emperor, else by blaspheming Christus.
Pliny also pointed out that Christians gathered together before daylight to recite "by turns a form of words to Christ as a god and that they bound themselves with an oath not to commit theft or robbery or adultery, nor to break their word, and not to deny a deposit when demanded."

While Pliny often uses the word "Christians" he uses "Christus " only twice. His letter, written about A.D. 112, adds little to our knowledge of Christian beliefs and practices. However it does corroborate the existence of Christians whose faith was in Christ.

Tacitus

A Roman historian, Cornelius Tacitus (A.D.55-117) lived under several Roman emperors. His Annals and Histories filled thirty books and covered the period between A.D. 14 and 96. His account of the great fire of Rome in A.D. 64, for which Nero was blamed, contains reference to Christians and to Christ:

"Consequently to get rid of the report, Nero fastened the guilt, and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of one of the procurators, Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome where all things hideous and shameful from every part of the world find their center and become popular."

The naming of Tiberius and Pontius Pilate in this passage shows that Tacitus had his chronology clear. Christ was for Tacitus an historical person. The anti-Christian tone of the report precludes the possibility of a Christian Interpolation. Although there is no reference to sources, Tacitus had been governor of the province of Asia, where there were many Christians. He was also a close friend of Pliny, from whom he could have heard other information on Christ and the Christians. And he was also aware that the movement, temporarily checked by Jesus' death, had spread from Judea to Rome, where an immense multitude professed its faith and were willing to die rather than recant.

Suetonius

In his "Life of Claudius" Suetonius, chief secretary of the Roman emperor Hadrian, writing around A.D. 125, tells of the expulsion of the Jews from Rome under Claudius (A.D. 49): "Since the Jews were constantly causing disturbances at the instigation of Christus he (Claudius) expelled them from Rome."

This banishment is the same one as noted in Acts 18:1-2. "After these things Paul departed from Rome and came to Corinth and found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy with his wife Priscilla; because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome."

Lucian of Samosata

Lucian, a second century satirist, derided Christians and their founder. In the "Death of the Peregrine," he provides information on what seems to have been a common understanding regarding Christians in those times.

"The Christians, you know, worship a man to this day--the distinguished personage who introduced their novel rites, and was crucified on that account….you see, these misguided creatures start with the conviction that they are immortal for all time, which explains their contempt of death and voluntary self-devotion which are so common among them; and then it was impressed on them by their original lawgiver that they are all brothers, from the moment that they are converted, and deny the gods of Greece, and worship the crucified sage, and live after his laws."

Note that Lucien does not use the usual word for "crucified," but instead he uses "anaskolopisthenta" which means "impaled." Perhaps this is because crucifixion was derived from impalement but it could be that both the name and means by which the one whom the Christians worshipped met his death were unknown to Lucien. Another section of "Peregrine" gives Palestine as the location where the one whom the Christians worship met his death, hence there can be no doubt that Lucien was referring to Jesus.

Thus from Jewish and pagan sources there exists enough references to substantiate the New Testament witness to the existence of Jesus as a real historical person.

# Reliability of New Testament Sources

Obviously the most important sources of information on Jesus are in the New Testament. The Gospels are evidently faith documents written from a Christian viewpoint. But are they reliable historical documents?

There are several reasons to consider these documents as historically reliable.--they are close in time to the actual life of Jesus; ancient manuscripts are abundant; chronological information from Luke further indicates their historical accuracy; and archaeological discoveries corroborate information provided in the Gospels. Finally, the effects of the Gospels must also be considered.

The Gospels--proximity of authors to the events.

The texts of Matthew, Mark, and Luke do not name their authors whereas in John 21:24, John himself is claimed to be the author of the fourth gospel.

Matthew and John were both apostles, eye witnesses to the events narrated. Mark may have been the young man who fled naked the night that Jesus was arrested (Mark 14:51-52); he was later involved with Paul in missionary work (Acts 15:37), with Barnabas (Acts 15:39), and with Peter (1 Peter 5:13). Luke was Paul's traveling companion (Col. 4:12; 2 Tim 4:11) and was also the generally accepted author of Acts.

Earliest tradition vouches for Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John as the authors of their Gospels. For Matthew, information derives from Papias of Hierapolis around A.D. 140. About Mark, Papias states that he was "Peter's interpreter," who wrote down Peter's story of Jesus.

About A.D.185 Irenaeus, Bishop of Lyon in France, wrote that Luke, Paul's fellow apostle, had written a Gospel which provided the story of Jesus not given in the other three Gospels. While there is uncertainty concerning the chronology for writing of the Gospels, there is no doubt all were written within a generation of actual events.

References to the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus occur frequently in the Pauline Epistles that can be dated with reasonable precision to the middle of the first century and may even pre-date the Gospels themselves. In 1 Corinthians 11:23-26, Paul cites a tradition he had received, the celebration of the Lord's Supper. This letter was written from Ephesus (1 Cor. 16:8) towards the end of Paul's third journey, the generally accepted date being A.D. 57.

In the same epistle Paul passes on another "tradition"--the death and resurrection of Christ (1 Cor. 15:3-9). In these verses he lists people who had seen Jesus after his resurrection, "most of whom were still alive" at the time of Paul's writing (more than 500 according to both Paul in 1 Cor. 15:6 and The Urantia Book p. 2042). The survival of eye witnesses some twenty-five years after the events was, for Paul, clear evidence that Jesus had indeed come back to life.

Manuscripts that testify to the accuracy of the Gospels

The John Rylands papyrus is the oldest extant fragment of the Gospel of John. Found in Egypt, it dates from the first half of the second century, thus confirming the composition of the Gospel of John by the end of the first century A.D.

Most of the Gospel of John also appears in the Bodmer Papyrus 11 from the same period. The Chester Beatty papyri, also found in Egypt, are a collection of codices, three of which contain major portions of the New Testament. Of the discovery of these papyri in 1930, Sir Frederick Kenyon wrote:

"No other extant manuscripts of ancient works come from so near the time of their original writing."

The number of ancient New Testament manuscripts is also remarkable. In Greek alone there are at least 5,686.

Because Christianity was from the beginning a missionary religion, the New Testament soon began to be translated into other languages. The first of these was into Syriac sometime in the second century; the oldest extant Syriac manuscripts come from the fourth century. Latin versions followed, culminating in the Vulgate, translated by Jerome in the second half of the fourth century. Coptic manuscripts come from the third century, whereas Armenian and Ethiopic  versions are from the fifth and sixth centuries. In all more than 19,000 manuscripts in other languages survive.

Not only do many manuscripts exist but the writings of the New Testament are well attested in the works of the Church Fathers. The writings of Justin Martyr (died A.D. 165), Irenaeus (A.D. 130-202), Clement of Alexandria (A.D. 150-215), Origen (A.D. 185-254), Tertullian (A.D. 160-225), Hippolytus (A.D. 170-236) and Eusebius (A.D. 260-340) contain over 19,000 quotations and citations from the Gospels. So much of the New Testament appears in the writings of the Church Fathers that, had we no ancient manuscripts, the greater part of the New Testament could be reconstructed from their writings.

Certainly there are minor variations among these many manuscripts but scholars agree that there is no modification in the basic message that they convey.


Luke's chronology


In ancient times precise dates seem to have been less important than they are today and, in the Gospels, only Luke provides specific chronological data. In Luke 2:1,2, we find: "And it came to pass in those days that there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria."

Josephus identifies Cyrenius as governor in Syria from A.D. 6 onwards. However an inscription from Antioch shows he was proconsul in Syria from 11 B.C. until after the death of Herod the Great in 4 B.C.

A papyrus published by the British Museum shows that the Roman census took place every fourteen years, with one beginning in 8 B.C. In addition, an archaeological find from Egypt shows that it was customary for people to return to their city of birth "in order that they may complete the family registration of the enrollment."

Again in Luke 3:1,2 we find its author demonstrating the historicity of his Gospel when he states:

"(1) Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberias Caesar, Pontius Pilate being governor of Judea, Herod being tetrarch of Galilee, and his brother, Philip, tetrarch of Ituraea and  Trachonitis, and Lysanais, the tetrarch of Abilene.
(2) Annas and Caiaphas being the high priests, the word of God came unto John….

Pilate's tenure was from A.D. 26-36, Herod Antipas from 4 B.C. to A.D. 39, Philip from 4.B.C. to A.D. 33/34. Caiaphas  was the official high priest from A.D. 18/19 to A.D. 36, while his father-in-law, Annas, although deposed in A.D. 15, appears to have retained his "high priest" title. Regarding Lysanias, an inscription from the reign of Tiberias has shown that one of that name was indeed tetrarch in Abila, near Damascus.

This carefully constructed synchronization of dates by Luke helps to provide confidence in the historicity of the events narrated.


Archaeology


The naming by Luke of Lysanias as being tetrarch of Abila is but one of the archaeological evidences for the accuracy of the Gospel stories. In fact, Luke's mention of geographical sites--thirty-two countries, fifty four cities, and nine islands--has proved to be totally accurate. Though New Testament archaeology has not yet corroborated where Jesus lived, it has shown there was a synagogue at Capernaum in the first century A.D. Thus archaeology has illuminated and in some cases confirmed the existence of people, places, and cultural factors relevant to the historical Jesus.

Because Nazareth was not mentioned by Paul or Josephus and did not appear in the Talmud, some thought that town only came into being decades or even centuries after Jesus. However archaeologists have found lists of priests who were sent from Jerusalem to other places after the Temple was destroyed in 70 A.D.--and in the lists was Nazareth.

Furthermore, first century tombs have been discovered at the Nazareth site as well as the remains of three watch towers, irrigation trenches, and agricultural terraces. There is agreement that a village consisting of eighty to one hundred houses existed there during the first century A.D

The study of first century ports surrounding the Sea of Galilee--Capernaum, Gergesa, Magdala, and Tiberias--was made possible by a modern drought. A well-preserved first-century fishing boat found near Magdala adds to the information on fishing in the Sea of Galilee.
In John's Gospel (5:2) we find the affirmation that the Pool of Bethesda had five porticos (porches). This accurately describes the ruins of the double pool that are still located to the north of temple area and is identified as the site where Jesus healed a paralytic.

Further archaeological evidence takes the form of Roman coins dated A.D.29 and 31 that bear the name of Pontius Pilate. An inscription bearing Pilate's name was also discovered in 1961 in Caesarea thus corroborating the Gospel and extra biblical material affirming that Pilate was procurator of Judea at the time of Jesus' crucifixion.

Archaeology has also corroborated the Gospel's  references  to coins--Jewish, Greek, and Roman. The widow's "mite" or "copper coin" was a Jewish coin worth half a "kodrantes." Matthew (10:29) tells us that "two sparrows were sold for a "farthing"--actually a Roman "assarion" worth four "kodrantes." The Roman "denarius" (equivalent to the Greek "drachma") was a small silver coin considered to be normal wages for a day's labor (Matthew 20: 2, 9, 10). Excavations have found all of these coins, dated from the time of Jesus and the Gospels.

Christian symbols and prayers to Jesus have been discovered by archaeology that can be dated to less than a quarter of a century after Jesus' death. E.L. Sukenik discovered two ossuaries in a tomb near Jerusalem that were dated to A.D. 50. On them were charcoal graffiti of four crosses and the phrases "Iesous iou" and "Iesous aloth" The first phrase is understood as a prayer to Jesus for help, the second a request that Jesus would raise the person whose bones occupied the ossuary. These graffiti are believed to be the earliest Christian inscriptions.

# The Effects of the Gospel Records

A thorough and objective search for the historical Jesus leads us back to the historically reliable documents that constitute the New Testament record of his life and teachings.  Although we are not certain of the exact day of Jesus' birth, nevertheless it was an event that has divided history--B.C. before Christ and A.D., Anno domini, "in the year of our Lord." Such a clear demarcation would hardly have been made were there no historical basis for the life of Jesus.

The change in Peter, from a coward who denied Jesus (Luke 22:60,61) to a passionate proclaimer of the resurrected Jesus only fifty days after the event (Acts 2) is remarkable. His ardor continued until he himself was crucified for proclaiming that self-same message.

Throughout nearly 2000 years, Christians have obeyed the Gospel commision (Matthew 28:18-20), travelling far from home, living in difficult lands, dying as martyrs--all for the certainty of their belief in the historicity of the Gospel narratives.

It is unlikely that the devotion so many have displayed in spite of dreadful persecution could have been aroused by an inconsequential Jew who only lived a good life and died ignominiously early in the first century. Christian devotion flows from something far deeper, something that cries out to the believer, "This is worth dying for."

Christian faith is far more than merely believing. The story of Jesus is a matter of knowing. In John's Gospel, Jesus "knows" the Father (10:15)
who, in turn, "knows" His flock (v. 27). Jesus wants his disciples to "know" God, for such knowledge is eternal life (17:3). And the author of the Gospel was totally sure of his record: "And he that saw it bare record and his record is true, that you might believe" (John 19:35). However the author of this Gospel did not conclude on that note. His words included, "Blessed are they that have not seen yet have believed." (20:29)

The account of Jesus' birth given in the second chapter of Matthew includes Herod the Great's slaying of all children under  two years of age and the flight of Joseph and Mary with the infant Jesus to Egypt but is devoid of chronological data other than that when Herod was dead an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream instructing him to take the child and his mother and return to Israel (Matt. 2:19-21).

Matthew's account makes no mention of the reason for Joseph and Mary being in Bethlehem at the time of Jesus' birth. That information is provided in these words (Luke 2:1-4):

1. And it came to pass in those days that a decree went out from Caesar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed.
2. And this taxing was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria.
3. And all went to be taxed, every one into his own city.
4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth into Judea, unto the city of David which is called Bethlehem: because he was of the house and lineage of David.

Chronological data is concealed in the phrase "in those days" which refers back to "in the days of Herod…" (Luke 1:5), and also in Luke 2:2 "when Cyrenius was governor of Syria"

"In the days of Herod," certainly means prior to to B.C.4 when Herod died. "When Cyrenius was governor of Syria"  means between 11 B.C. and   4 B.C., the period when Cyrenius was actually governor of Syria according to an inscription from Antioch.

A papyrus in the British museum states the Roman census commenced in 8 B.C. Another papyrus from Egypt says it was customary for people to return to their city of birth to complete the family registration.

Note that The Urantia Book states Jesus was born in Bethlehem on August 21, 7 B.C. (p.1351) and that Joseph and Mary, having received warning of Herod's intention in mid-October of 6 B.C., to kill all infants in Bethlehem under two years of age, left for Alexandria in Egypt. (p. 1354)]

All of which demonstrates a remarkable congruence of information stemming from Luke's and Matthew's Gospels, a papyrus in the British museum and another from Egypt, archaeological finds from Egypt and Antioch, several historians,and finally The Urantia Book.

# The Early Years of Jesus

For Urantia Book readers, and assuming the absence of the Urantia revelation, it is both interesting and educational to realise how little is known about the pre-baptismal phase of Jesus' life. Without The Urantia Book not even the date or year of Jesus' birth is known.

The revelation also provides us with a detailed account of those formative years of Jesus in which he was fully a mortal man, one having no knowledge of his own divinity and  scarcely an inkling of the post-baptismal life that would confront him as both God and man.

Again without The Urantia Book, what  could we have known about that early life? Other than the few scraps of information contained within the Gospels of the New Testament, our only recourse is to assume that Jesus would have received the same kind of training as any other Galilean child having parents such as Mary and Joseph, living in a town such as Nazareth in Galilee where Joseph was a carpenter.

The Gospels tell us that Jesus' birth took place at Bethlehem where Mary and Joseph had gone to participate in a census ordered by the Roman Emperor, Caesar Augustus. But while in Bethlehem an "angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt and be thou there until I bring you word, for Herod will seek the young child to destroy him." (Matthew 2: 13) 

Later, when Herod was dead, an angel of the Lord again appeared to Joseph in a dream, saying: Arise, and take the young child and his mother and go into the land of Israel. For they are dead which sought the young child's life."  (Matthew 2; Luke 2). Finally Joseph, Mary, and Jesus settled in Nazareth.

Outside of this birth scene and the Egyptian sojourn, all we know for certain about the very early life of Jesus at Nazareth is contained in a single verse from Luke's Gospel: "And the child grew, and waxed strong in spirit, filled with wisdom, and the grace of God was upon him."

Of Jesus as a young adolescent we are again beholden to Luke for detail. Every year Joseph and Mary attended the annual Passover festival in Jerusalem. When Jesus was twelve years old and it was time to return from Jerusalem to Nazareth along with a party of kinsfolk, Jesus was accidentally left behind. But the fact that he was missing was not noticed until the party had travelled a full day's journey.

Mary and Joseph immediately left their kinsfolk to return to Jerusalem and search for Jesus. However three fruitless days passed before they tried looking in the Temple where Jesus was found. Mary immediately asked Jesus why he had treated them so--to which Luke has Jesus say, "How is it  that you sought after me? Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business?" (Luke 2:49)

All four Gospels commence their next phase first with an introduction to John the Baptist, followed by John's baptism of Jesus. For further possibilities upon how Jesus may have passed his childhood we turn to the accounts of historians who tell us how male children of practicing Jews were brought up in provincial Galilee.

One such historian1 states that: "nowhere does the historical background of Jesus betray any influence from the general atmosphere of Greek culture or Roman civilization of his day. There is no evidence he was acquainted with the Greek language. His mother tongue was a provincial dialect, Aramaic, the peculiar speech that betrayed the Galilean origin of his disciples. It was in this dialect that Jesus thought, taught, preached, and prayed--and cried to God in his direst need--Abba in Gethsemane, Eloi, Eloi on the cross."

Another historian, Alfred Edersheim,2 looks at Jesus' early life from a different perspective. He informs us about the kind of upbringing and education young Jewish boys would most likely have received in a province such as Galilee at the time of Jesus.

"For study at school from the age of five up to ten years, the Bible was exclusively the text-book. From ten to fifteen years it was the "Mishner" or traditional law; after that age the student entered on those theological studies as were held in the higher acadamies of the Rabbis.

"Study of the Bible commenced with Leviticus. Then it passed on to other parts of the Pentateuch--the first five books of the Bible--and finally to the Talmud, the oral law, but only to those students over fifteen years of age."

The "Bible" or "Old Testament" and the "Mishna" were usually in Hebrew, the Talmud in Aramaean.

There is no record in the Gospels for Jesus having proceeded to studies in the Academies. However it is obvious from the content of the Gospels that he had a highly advanced knowledge of both the law and the prophets. Edersheim claims Jesus spoke Hebrew, Greek, possibly Latin, and Aramaean.

Thus there is a vast difference between Jesus' early life according to what is known from the Gospels and that which is given in The Urantia Book. Particularly this is true for writers such as Bundy1 who assumes that Jesus was an uneducated provincial with no knowledge of the Greek and Roman worlds beyond Galilee.

Missing from both the biblical account and that of our selected historians is the fact that during Jesus' childhood the capital city of provincial Galilee was Sepphoris. The capital moved to Tiberias on the shores of the lake in A.D. 21, but  Sepphoris remained as an important Greco-Roman city. This ancient city site was being excavated in 1985 in a joint project between the Hebrew and Duke Universities. It is situated on a hill less than five miles from Nazareth, and was a relatively large city complete with amphitheatre, palace, etc. as would be expected for a city built by one as vain as Herod Antipas.

Sepphoris does not get a mention in connection with Jesus  and is not mentioned either in the Old or New Testaments but Edersheim confirms its early historicity by a comment that it was captured by Jewish nationalists early in the first century2. This is surprising since Edersheim's one thousand page book was not published until 1993, long after archaeological explorations had given that city much publicity at least in relevant academic circles.

Such a large city in close proximity to Nazareth where Jesus appears to have spent much of his early life but nevertheless failing to get a mention  either in the Gospel literature or by modern historians is an unexplained mystery. However it appears to be highly unlikely that Jesus could have lived within easy walking distance of the provincial capital and not be influenced by its presence.

Certainly the omission has been remedied in The Urantia Book (published 1955) which informs us that not only did Jesus spend several years full time working in Sepphoris, but also that his earthly father, Joseph, was killed there while working on one of Herod's building projects.

Thus Jesus was not a country yokel who had never been exposed to Greco-Roman civilization1. According to The Urantia Book, his father, Joseph, spoke both fluent Aramaic and fluent Greek, and taught the young Jesus Greek from a Greek language version of the scriptures that was presented to Jesus by a family friend when a child in Egypt.

# What was the Gospel of Jesus?

If we search the Urantia Book for the occurrence of a concise phrase such as "gospel of Jesus," we get 13 "exact matches,"--not one of which provides any information on the actual content of Jesus' gospel. If the search is repeated using a King James translation of the New Testament, we get a single "exact match,"--the opening verse of Mark's gospel. However if a modern English translation of Mark is used, we may draw a blank.

What are our expectations? Initially they may be for a list of key teachings such as occurs in the "Sermon on the Mount." However, the following statement from The Urantia Book may either confuse or discourage us:



"The so-called "Sermon on the Mount" is not the gospel of Jesus. It does contain much helpful instruction, but it was Jesus' ordination charge to the twelve apostles. It was the Master's personal commission to those who were to go on preaching the gospel and aspiring to represent him in the world of men even as he was so eloquently and perfectly representative of his Father." (TUB 140:5)

In The Urantia Book the "Sermon on the Mount" is also called the "Ordination Sermon." If it does not contain the gospel of Jesus, what then should we be looking for?

One of the "exact matches" for The Urantia Book search on the "gospel of Jesus" referred to the apostle, Simon Zelotes, and his post-crucifixion career. About Simon we read:

"He was in despair, but in a few years he rallied his hopes and went forth to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom.

"He went to Alexandria and, after working up the Nile, penetrated into the heart of Africa, everywhere preaching the gospel of Jesus and baptizing believers. Thus he labored until he was an old man and feeble. And he died and was buried in the heart of Africa." (TUB 139:11)

So is the "gospel of the kingdom" simply a synonym for the "gospel of Jesus." Are the "gospel of Jesus" and the "gospel of the kingdom" identical?

The Gospel of the Kingdom


A few days before the preaching of this sermon on "The Kingdom," as Jesus was at work in the boatshop, Peter brought him the news of John's arrest. Jesus laid down his tools, removed his apron, and said to Peter: "The Father's hour has come. Let us make ready to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom."

The next day Jesus sent his brother James, to ask for the privilege of speaking in the  synagogue the coming Sabbath day. And the synagogue ruler was much pleased that Jesus was again willing to conduct the service. (TUB 137:8)

And this is what Jesus appears to have proclaimed to be "the gospel of the kingdom"--at least on this occasion:

"I have come to proclaim the establishment of the Father's kingdom. And this kingdom shall include the worshiping souls of Jew and gentile, rich and poor, free and bond, for my Father is no respecter of persons; his love and his mercy are over all.

"The Father in heaven sends his spirit to indwell the minds of men, and when I shall have finished my work on earth, likewise shall the Spirit of Truth be poured out upon all flesh. And the spirit of my Father and the Spirit of Truth shall establish you in the coming kingdom of spiritual understanding and divine righteousness.

"My kingdom is not of this world. The Son of Man will not lead forth armies in battle for the establishment of a throne of power or a kingdom of worldly glory. When my kingdom shall have come, you shall know the Son of Man as the Prince of Peace, the revelation of the everlasting Father. The children of this world fight for the establishment and enlargement of the kingdoms of this world, but my disciples shall enter the kingdom of heaven by their moral decisions and by their spirit victories; and when they once enter therein, they shall find joy, righteousness, and eternal life.

"Those who first seek to enter the kingdom, thus beginning to strive for a nobility of character like that of my Father, shall presently possess all else that is needful. But I say to you in all sincerity: Unless you seek entrance into the kingdom with the faith and trusting dependence of a little child, you shall in no wise gain admission.

"Be not deceived by those who come saying here is the kingdom or there is the kingdom, for my Father's kingdom concerns not things visible and material. And this kingdom is even now among you, for where the spirit of God teaches and leads the soul of man, there in reality is the kingdom of heaven. And this kingdom of God is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.

"John did indeed baptize you in token of repentance and for the remission of your sins, but when you enter the heavenly kingdom, you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.

"In my Father's kingdom there shall be neither Jew nor gentile, only those who seek perfection through service, for I declare that he who would be great in my Father's kingdom must first become server of all. If you are willing to serve your fellows, you shall sit down with me in my kingdom, even as, by serving in the similitude of the creature, I shall presently sit down with my Father in his kingdom.

"This new kingdom is like a seed growing in the good soil of a field. It does not attain full fruit quickly. There is an interval of time between the establishment of the kingdom in the soul of man and that hour when the kingdom ripens into the full fruit of everlasting righteousness and eternal salvation.

"And this kingdom which I declare to you is not a reign of power and plenty. The kingdom of heaven is not a matter of meat and drink but rather a life of progressive righteousness and increasing joy in the perfecting service of my Father who is in heaven. For has not the Father said of his children of the world, `It is my will that they should eventually be perfect, even as I am perfect.'

"I have come to preach the glad tidings of the kingdom. I have not come to add to the heavy burdens of those who would enter this kingdom. I proclaim the new and better way, and those who are able to enter the coming kingdom shall enjoy the divine rest. And whatever it shall cost you in the things of the world, no matter what price you may pay to enter the kingdom of heaven, you shall receive manyfold more of joy and spiritual progress in this world, and in the age to come eternal life.

"Entrance into the Father's kingdom waits not upon marching armies, upon overturned kingdoms of this world, nor upon the breaking of captive yokes. The kingdom of heaven is at hand, and all who enter therein shall find abundant liberty and joyous salvation.

"This kingdom is an everlasting dominion. Those who enter the kingdom shall ascend to my Father; they will certainly attain the right hand of his glory in Paradise. And all who enter the kingdom of heaven shall become the sons of God, and in the age to come so shall they ascend to the Father. And I have not come to call the would-be righteous but sinners and all who hunger and thirst for the righteousness of divine perfection.

"John came preaching repentance to prepare you for the kingdom; now have I come proclaiming faith, the gift of God, as the price of entrance into the kingdom of heaven. If you would but believe that my Father loves you with an infinite love, then you are in the kingdom of God."

When he had thus spoken, he sat down. All who heard him were astonished at his words. (TUB 138: 8)

So was this sermon, given on the first preaching tour by Jesus and his twelve disciples, a more or less exact statement of both "the gospel of Jesus" and "the gospel of the kingdom?" Clarification may be in the following:

"It is just because the gospel of Jesus was so many-sided that within a few centuries students of the records of his teachings became divided up into so many cults and sects. This pitiful subdivision of Christian believers results from failure to discern in the Master's manifold teachings the divine oneness of his matchless life. But someday the true believers in Jesus will not be thus spiritually divided in their attitude before unbelievers. Always we may have diversity of intellectual comprehension and interpretation, even varying degrees of socialization, but lack of spiritual brotherhood is both inexcusable and reprehensible." (TUB 170: 5)



If we scan The Urantia Book for an exact match to the phrase "gospel of the kingdom," we get 180 such matches,  the vast majority quoting the phrase but failing to supply information on its meaning. An exception is:



"Jesus endeavored to make clear to his apostles the difference between his teachings and his life among them and the teachings which might subsequently spring up about him. Said Jesus: My kingdom and the gospel related thereto shall be the burden of your message. Be not sidetracked into preaching about me and about my teachings. Proclaim the gospel of the kingdom and portray my revelation of the Father in heaven but do not be misled into the bypaths of creating legends and building up a cult having to do with beliefs and teachings about my beliefs and teachings." (TUB 138: 6.3)

Thus we are to proclaim the many-sided gospel and its teachings but we are to portray Jesus' revelation of the Father. A dictionary definition of to portray is to act out or to imitate whereas to proclaim is to publish or to make known.

The kind of things to be "proclaimed" are listed in: Jesus' concept of the kingdom:



"The Master made it clear that the kingdom of heaven must begin with, and be centered in, the dual concept of the truth of the fatherhood of God and the correlated fact of the brotherhood of man.

The acceptance of such a teaching, Jesus declared, would liberate man from the age-long bondage of animal fear and at the same time enrich human living with the following endowments of the new life of spiritual liberty:

1. The possession of new courage and augmented spiritual power. The gospel of the kingdom was to set man free and inspire him to dare to hope for eternal life.

2. The gospel carried a message of new confidence and true consolation for all men, even for the poor.

3. It (the gospel) was in itself a new standard of moral values, a new ethical yardstick wherewith to measure human conduct. It portrayed the ideal of a resultant new order of human society.

4. It (the gospel) taught the pre-eminence of the spiritual compared with the material; it glorified spiritual realities and exalted superhuman ideals.

5. This new gospel held up spiritual attainment as the true goal of living. Human life received a new endowment of moral value and divine dignity.

6. Jesus taught that eternal realities were the result (reward) of righteous earthly striving. Man's mortal sojourn on earth acquired new meanings consequent upon the recognition of a noble destiny.

7. The new gospel affirmed that human salvation is the revelation of a far-reaching divine purpose to be fulfilled and realized in the future destiny of the endless service of the salvaged sons of God. (TUB 170: 2)

The gospel then was many faceted. In The Urantia Book it was the gospel of Jesus; the gospel of the kingdom; the kingdom of the spirit; the religion of the spirit; the new gospel. From the New Testament it was the gospel of Jesus Christ (Mark); the gospel of the kingdom, (Matthew; Mark); the gospel of God (Paul); the gospel of Christ (Paul); the gospel of our Lord, Jesus Christ (Paul). 

On the other hand, what it is we must portray in our own lives is the same mission as discussed by Jesus and Immanuel prior to the Michael incarnation in which Immanuel states:

"Exhibit in your one short life in the flesh, as it has never before been seen in all Nebadon, the transcendent possibilities attainable by a God-knowing human during the short career of mortal existence and make a new and illuminating interpretation of….the achievement of God seeking man and finding him and the phenomenon of man seeking God and finding him" (TUB  120:8).


This concept was later reiterated by Jesus to those who are his followers:


Your mission to the world is founded on the fact that I lived a God-revealing life among you; on the truth that you and all other men are the sons of God; and it shall consist in the life which you will live among men--the actual and living experience of loving men and serving them, even as I have loved and served you. (TUB 191: 5.3)

# Conclusions

In this review we have touched upon the vast difference between the life and times of Jesus as it is portrayed in both the New Testament and Christian writings, and what we may learn from The Urantia Book.

For Christianity, as it is taught in most orthodox churches, Jesus is best known because his crucifixion is taken by Christians to have been the ransom paid to an apparently angry God for the remission of the sins of mankind. Problematically, this same God is also known as the God who is love personified.

For this bizarre situation, a major portion of its bizarreness can be put down to Paul for almost all of his writings were completed and in circulation among the early Christians well before anything else now in the New Testament had been recorded. Important among Paul's writings is 1 Corinthians 11: 23-25:

"For I have received of the Lord that which I have also delivered to you--that the Lord Jesus, the same night on which he was betrayed took bread. And when he had given thanks he broke it saying, 'Take eat, this is my body which is broken for you. This do in remembrance of me.' And after the same manner he took the cup, and when he had supped, said, 'This cup is God's new covenant, sealed with my blood. Whenever you drink it, do so in memory of me.'"

Termed the "Last Supper" these same words were repeated in the Synoptic Gospels, all three of which were written at a later date than Paul's letters.

The Gospel versions differ somewhat from that of Paul. Matthew (26:27,28) has, "Drink you all of it. For this is my blood of the new testament, which is shed for many for the remission of sin." Mark and Luke omit "for the remission of sin." Repeated throughout Paul's letters we also find that redemption from sin is through the blood of Christ. (Ephesians 1:7; Colossians 1:14; Hebrews 9:12, 15)

In contrast the Urantia revelation has no mention of "sacrifice" or "blood" in its version of the Last Supper--and it does state emphatically: "Jesus is not about to die as a sacrifice for sin. He is not going to atone for the inborn moral guilt of the human race." (TUB 185:5.7) Even more emphatically it has:

"The barbarous idea of appeasing an angry God, of propitiating an offended Lord, of winning the favor of Deity through sacrifices and penance and even by the shedding of blood, represents a religion wholly puerile and primitive, a philosophy unworthy of an enlightened age of science and truth. Such beliefs are utterly repulsive to the celestial beings and the divine rulers who serve and reign in the universes. It is an affront to God to believe, hold, or teach that innocent blood must be shed in order to win his favor or to divert the fictitious divine wrath." (TUB 4: 5.4)

What The Urantia Book says is undoubtedly both logical and true. Yet it remains a fact that few Christians see the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross in payment for the sins of mankind as in any way reflecting adversely on the nature of the God whom they worship as love personified.

The illogicality, indeed absurdity, of this stance just does  not enter their heads.

Question: Will Christianity ever awaken to its irreconcilable doctrinal inconsistencies? How can Urantia Book readers help to prepare the way? But is it really all that important?

For many Urantia Book readers the answers have slowly and painfully evolved over many years.

For some the answer may be that it is not solely our task. We all have our own indwelling Spirit of God--our Thought Adjuster-- plus the Spirit of Truth--Jesus' Spirit--to guide us. The answers for such problems are in the hands of Divinity. The means to the answers are ours--or at least it is a shared task:

This gospel of the kingdom belongs to both Jew and gentile, to rich and poor, to free and bond, to male and female, even to the little children. And you are all to proclaim this gospel of love and truth by the lives which you live in the flesh. You shall love one another with a new and startling affection, even as I have loved you. You will serve mankind with a new and amazing devotion, even as I have served you. And when men see you so love them, and when they behold how fervently you serve them, they will perceive that you have become faith-fellows of the kingdom of heaven, and they will follow after the Spirit of Truth which they see in your lives, to the finding of eternal salvation. (TUB 191: 6.2)



Salvation is the free gift of God, but those who are born of the spirit will immediately begin to show forth the fruits of the spirit in loving service to their fellow creatures. And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. (TUB 193: 2.2)

# Special Notice  

Approaching my 83rd birthday and having recently suffered a small stroke, with regret I am forced to accept that no longer can continue with Innerface International. Hence this will be our last issue. 

Some 12 years ago, when Innerface commenced, one of our purposes was to draw attention to lk prophetic science content of the Urantia Papers. However, it came as quite a surprise to discover that ,onsiderable portion of this science contradicted what appears to be well-founded scientific opinion. Th ed to the realization that there are two sides to The Urantia Books science material. One is covered and he heading, "The Limitations of Revelation," (TUB 101:4] which states: 

"Because your world is general, ignorant of origins....it has appeared to be wise....to provide instruction in cosmology. And always has this made trouble for the future. The laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge. Any cosmology presented as part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short time....within a few short years many of o:tr• statements.... will stand in need of revision." 

The other side is exemplified by the wisdom of the revelatory in pursuing their two-sided policy-becoming self-evident if we follow current disputation between the advocates of "Creationism," "Intelligent Design" etc. to support their fundamentalist views. So did the Urantia Book's authors include both prophetic science along with outdated materials to avoid the possibility of a fundamentalist high-jacking of our 5th epochal revelation? Only time will tell. 

The God of Jesus, the one Jesus called "Father," has no need for proof of his reality. The revelators inform us that faith and faith alone is all that is required of us. And Jesus gave us one simple new commandment that we should love one another even as he loves us for by this will all men know that we are his disciples ifwe thus love one another. 

Yours with love,
Ken Glasziou
