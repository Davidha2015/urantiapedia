# “Let There Be Light”

“When once you grasp the idea of God as a true and loving Father, the only concept which Jesus ever taught, you must forthwith, in all consistency, utterly abandon all those primitive notions about God....The infinite love of God is not secondary to anything in the divine nature.” (2017)

This statement may introduce one of the most important concepts in The Urantia Book for the current needs of our planet.

The resurrection of a religion is dependent on it embracing a true belief about the nature of God. A wrong belief will lead it far astray. The religions of man falter and founder on the rocks of false concepts about the nature of God.

A concept that has plagued Christianity from very early times is that a perfectly just and perfectly righteous God is obligated to reward virtue and punish sin. Otherwise his perfection as a judge would be jeopardized.

Jesus said, “What man is there among you who, if his son asks for bread, would give him a stone. Or if he asks for a fish would give him a water snake. If you then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good things to them that ask him.”

If reality is that God is a true and loving Father, then anything inconsistent with that actuality cannot be true.

In the parable of the prodigal son, Jesus portrayed the father as one who went out to welcome his returning son before the boy even had the opportunity to beg for forgiveness. Likewise in the parable of the lost sheep, Jesus indicates that God is one who actively goes out to find and rescue the lost sinner. In the story of the laborers in the vineyard, Jesus indicates that God's mercy and love transcends his obligations as a judge. God does not discipline his children by the reward or punishment system that we use to train animals. He gives us the free will choice to embrace his perfect goodness as our ideal, but on a purely voluntary basis.

Christianity is not all that far off track. The presentation to Christianity of these biblical facts about the true nature of God in an appropriate and positive manner has the potential to correct all of its important inconsistencies. Thus The Urantia Book draws our attention to how the 4th Epochal Revelation can be revitalized to achieve the original task of our Master.

In a nutshell, the lesson that Chistianity now needs to learn is that Jesus revealed God as a gracious and compassionate Father whose love and mercy as a Father transcended his justice and righteousness as a judge. This concept of God automatically corrects serious error not just in Christianity but in all religion. For the present age, it is a major need.

Not that there are no Christians who are intimately familiar with the God portrayed by Jesus in The Urantia Book. In a recent episode of the British Broadcasting Commission's production, “Songs of Praise,” in an episode featuring the 14th century mystic, Julian of Norwich, a delightful little old priest was interviewed who required absolutely no lessons at all about a God whose love far transcended his wrath. The message just needs to become general.

# Personal Religion: A Sign of the Times

Jacques Tetrault, Tenebonne, Canada

As human beings our starting point is a feeling of great insecurity. We are searching for assurance, trying to develop self-confidence.

Sooner or later, we become spiritually intrigued, an irresistible intuition calls us to search for the meaning for our own existence. Even though there are numerous paths and ways opened, we usually tend to initially restrict our search to our immediate environment. What one finds there are various forms of dogmatism, established religions or fashionable new trends, cults, or gurus with preset instructions and modes of behavior. This is part of the quest.

Many stop right there. They have found, or believe they have found, a satisfactory recipe. They join, conform, and follow. This corresponds to adopting someone else's religion. It implies dependency to various extents on other people; so-called leaders or pre-set belief systems.

A few, more adventurous, more demanding and surely more secure souls, will take greater risks, not being satisfied with packaged goods. These individuals will launch their ship on the wide open seas of personal quest for truth. They dare to leave the protected harbor shores, all sail facing wind and waves; using their inner guidance, their insight, as sole (and soul) compass. These are the intrepid searchers of living truth, who will not satisfy themselves with dead and crystallized truth.

This is the great adventure for these brave souls who use their faith as a living and active asset. They take the risk of trusting, increasingly trusting God himself, daring to eliminate any intermediary who would presume to translate God's word or God's will to them, in their own living experience. They develop an original first hand personal religion.

One could argue that these are individualists, free-thinkers, or pretentious people. To my experience they are experienced believers and autonomous persons who strive for unity with God and therefore with all other believers. They have ceased being mortified by the fear of God and have become dedicated and motivated by God's love. Their commitment is no longer lukewarm and temporary but permanent and total. Whatever their initial conception of this reality may at first be, it has become deep rooted and individual. These sons and daughters of God carry on their daily tasks and every day live by becoming increasingly service orientated, offering freely their talents to do God's will more perfectly as they feel his will within themselves.

Such religious individuals who truly become consecrated to doing good are slowly growing in numbers and represent, I believe, the future of a truer, healthier spiritual living.

They exemplify the new spiritual path which  is producing a more abundant harvest of fruits of the spirit in ordinary life, as it is lived in an extraordinary way. They have no need of any organization to support them or to promote their deeds, their tasks being essentially of a spiritual nature.

I anticipate and propose that personal religion as a very promising avenue to restore the spiritual dimension in our world.

Truth is living, crystallized truths are dead. Man is called to forge ahead and grow renewed continuously. To leave behind any dependency and to venture into a personal communion with God requires some courage, but it liberates and emancipates. Free man cannot continue to obey and be directed by other men as concerns spiritual life. More mature individuals must dare embark on their own personal quest for God. And when he searches for God, God had already found him.

Since God rules the universe by the very power of his love, what do we really risk in giving him our total confidence and by following his internal guidance? He is my Father and yours. I experience his presence in me and that is where my religious experience starts. I have to risk trusting him. And that is not the end but the very beginning of my personal religious living.

Do you have a similar experience?

# Wouldn't It Be Great If?

Ken Glasziou

All around I see people from Christian organizations working in the field, succoring the needy, the unfortunate, the helpless, the oppressed—just as advocated by the Master. These are people from organizations such as the Salvation Army, St. Vincent's de Paul, Meals on Wheels for the elderly and the invalids, the soup kitchens for those who are down and out, and a myriad of others. But I have yet to see or hear about any similar operation specifically attributable to those belonging to the Urantia movement. No doubt they exist somewhere. If you know about one, how about writing a resume for Innerface?

Almost 2000 years ago, Christianity spread like wildfire. There was no TV or radio, travel for Christians was almost entirely by foot, there were no printing presses hence little in the way of the written word—and, in any case, few of these new Christians could read. So, in those times, the spread of the word was almost entirely due to person to person contact. Yet within fifty years of the crucifixion, Christianity had spread throughout the length and breadth of the Roman empire and had become a force to be reckoned with.

We Urantians are good at producing edifying newsletters and exhilarating conferences, we have developed skills at placing our book in libraries or displaying them at appropriate gatherings where seekers may find them, but where is the visible evidence that the book has made a difference in our lives?

Is it time for the teachings of The Urantia Book to not only become visible in the lives of its adherents but also to be visibly identifiable with us, as its adherents? Could we have Urantia soup kitchens, Urantia centers for the distribution of clothing, Urantian meals on wheels organizations, Urantian rehabilitation centers for drug addicts, anything like that to identify Urantians as carers who visibly portray the foundation of the book's teachings in that we are children of the Father, brothers and sisters to all in the one family of the one God? And maybe Urantia Community Centers? Wouldn't it be great if it were so?

# Self-Esteem

Author: **Ann Bendall**

To cater to the simplistic way in which individuals explore the complexity of human nature, psychology has coined the concept 'self esteem' to represent  what The Urantia Book refers to as conscience and its admonitions by the Thought Adjuster, self worth, and selfhood.

There is a general public awareness that self esteem is important and the construct has come to represent the individual feeling good about him/herself. In psychological parlance, self esteem means the degree to which one values oneself  according to realistic values and beliefs, and includes conscience, compassion for ourselves and others, recognition that we are experiential beings who predominantly learn from our mistakes, and tolerance for the imperfection of ourselves and others.

Hence, although the word esteem carries the connotation of high worth or value, the combined form self-esteem, refers to the full dimension, and so the degree of self-esteem (high or low) is usually specified, and can be contrasted with self-appraisal where the evaluative component is absent.

The higher the self-esteem the more the person can self actualise and grow as a result of their experiences, accepting their own uniqueness whilst respecting the uniqueness of others.

In contrast, the word has a totally different meaning ascribed to it by the revelators. Self esteem is used only twice in the Urantia Book, in each instance in describing traits of  the apostle John.  “John Zebedee had many lovely traits of character, but one which was not so lovely was his inordinate but usually well-concealed conceit. His long association with Jesus made many and great changes in his character. This conceit was greatly lessened, but after growing old and becoming more or less childish, this self-esteem reappeared to a certain extent, so that, when engaged in directing Nathan in the writing of the Gospel which now bears his name, the aged apostle did not hesitate repeatedly to refer to himself as the 'disciple whom Jesus loved.'” (1554)

In the second instance on page 1555, it is reflected to represent the undesirable characteristics of being, “bigoted and inordinately intolerant. .... But he (John) was not the only one of the twelve who was tainted with this kind of self-esteem and superiority consciousness.” That which we prize as high self-esteem, The Urantia Book regards as a concept consisting of conceit, bigotry and intolerance:

“The soil essential for religious growth presupposes a progressive life of self-realization, the co-ordination of natural propensities, the exercise of curiosity and the enjoyment of reasonable adventure, the experiencing of feelings of satisfaction, the functioning of the fear stimulus of attention and awareness, the wonder-lure, and a normal consciousness of smallness, humility. Growth is also predicated on the discovery of selfhood accompanied by self-criticism— conscience, for conscience is really the criticism of oneself  by one's own value-habits, personal ideals.” (1094)

“The marks of human response to the religious impulse embrace the qualities of nobility and grandeur. The sincere religionist is conscious of universe citizenship and is aware of making contact with sources of superhuman power. He is thrilled and energized with the assurance of belonging to a superior and ennobled fellowship of the sons of God. The consciousness of self-worth has become augmented by the stimulus of the quest for the highest universe objectives—supreme goals.” (1100)

# The Second Great Commandment. A Reminder

Ken Glasziou

At the time of Jesus, the Shema was recited twice daily by faithful Jews. “Hear, O Israel, the lord our God is one Lord, and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might.” This was the first great commandent referred to in the gospels.       The Fourth Epochal Revelation upgraded its meaning because of its revelation of the true nature of God through and in the life of Jesus. For the Jews, the second great commandment was to love your neighbor as yourself. The Fourth Epochal revelation brought a quantum leap to its meaning by upgrading it from a material to a spiritual level. It told us we must love one another as Jesus loved us.

Almost 2000 years later, we have been given an enhanced revelation of both of these two great commandments in The Urantia Book. However, if we are not living out the substance of the Fourth Epochal Revelation in our lives, the Fifth is wasted on us.

For the individual, it serves no useful purpose to be familiar with the definitions and explanations of such matters as God the Sevenfold, the difference between the absolutes and the ultimates, the existential and the experiential, the finite and the absonite, if the basics are absent from our actual living. Nor does it serve any useful purpose if we acquire a detailed intellectual knowledge about reincarnation, what the mansion worlds are really like, the differences between mind, body, soul, and personality, and all those other fascinating matters if the basics, the upgraded two great commandments, are absent from our lives.

The Urantia Book informs us that many mortals discern and interpret the golden rule as a purely intellectual affirmation of human fraternity. The enhanced version of the golden rule is to treat others as we conceive God would treat them. How many of us restrict its potential application only to those we conceive of as likely to treat us in the same way? And find them few and far between?

How does the book tell us we can comprehend the truth of the second great commandment? It states: “...by realizing its meaning in the living interpretation of the Spirit of Truth who directs the loving contact of one human being with another.” Does the Spirit of Truth really direct our personal relationships with our fellows? All relationships or just some? If the latter, we may need to check out the bit about, “all allegiance or none.” (1469)

Jesus' upgrade of the golden rule takes on “living qualities of spiritual realization” by making a quantum jump up to the spiritual plane, “when we so relate ourselves to our fellows that they will receive the highest possible good as a result of our contact with them.” Who was the Urantian who once said, “That stuff is alright in theory but this is a real world we are living in now.”?

Only a divine being can know what constitutes the highest possible good for our neighbor. As the book interprets neighbor, it includes family, friends, the person next door or down the street, and even includes our enemies if we have them. And because only a divine being can know anybody's highest possible good, the book tells us that its interpretation must come from the Spirit of Truth.

How can we know when we ourselves have made the quantum leap to the spiritual plane in our interpersonal relationships? One way, it seems, is that we are “filled to overflowing with the assurance of citizenship in a friendly universe.” So do we really feel that we live in a totally friendly home, town, workplace, country, world, universe? Maybe we have some homework to do with the big blue book, the Spirit of Truth, and our Thought Adjuster?

Do we ever ponder on Jesus' answer when Ganid asked him about his attitude to an aggressor? “Ganid, I have absolute confidence in my heavenly Father's overcare; I am consecrated to doing the will of my Father in heaven. I do not believe that real harm can befall me; I do not believe that my life work can really be jeopardized by anything my enemies might wish to visit upon me, and surely we have no violence to fear from our friends. I am absolutely assured that the entire universe is friendly to me—this all-powerful truth I insist on believing with a wholehearted trust in spite of all appearances to the contrary.” Faith that the universe is really friendly appears to be a prerequisite for being able to truly love others as Jesus loved us.

How do we get along with the Master's teaching about non-resistance to evil? It seems that this is basically a spiritual pronouncement. Turning the other cheek means that whatever our reaction might be, it has to be unselfish and it must consider the cosmic good of the evil-doer. For that, we need the direction of the Spirit of Truth. There are no rules. Every situation requiring a moral decision is unique. It has never happened exactly in that way before. Hence, “...love, unselfishness, must undergo a constant and living re-adaptive interpretation of relationships in accordance with the leading of the Spirit of Truth.” Only with such divine leading can our reactions be for the utmost cosmic good of the evil doer—who, coincidentally, is also our neighbor.

The essence of the Fifth Epochal Revelation's instruction on the second great 	
commandment is self-forgetfulness coupled to a conscious and continuous quest for the leading of the Spirit of Truth to direct all of our inter-personal relationships. How did Jesus love? Real love, God-like love, divine love, is gracious, compassionate, undemanding, under-standing, never selfish, always outgoing. Paul put it this way:

"Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, if I have not love I am become as sounding brass or a tinkling symbol. And though I have the gift of prophecy, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and though I have faith to move mountains, if I have not love, I am nothing. And though I bestow all my goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned, and have not love, it profits me nothing.

"Love suffers long and is kind; love envies not; vaunts not itself, is not puffed up. Love behaves not unseemly, is never self-seeking, never provocative, thinks no evil. Love rejoices not in iniquity, but rejoices in truth. Love bears all things, trusts all things, hopes all things, endures all things.

"Love never fails, but where there be prophecies they shall fail; where there be tongues they shall cease; where there be knowledge it shall pass away. For now we know in part, and we prophecy in part. But when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.

"When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child. But when I became a man, I put away childish things. For now we see as in a glass, darkly; but then, face to face. Now I know in part. Then I shall  know even as I am known. And now abides faith, hope, and love, these three; but the greatest of these is love. (1 Cor. 13)

# What Am I?

Boiled down to its indestructible basics, we mortals consist of two elements both of which have their immediate origin in the Universal Father.  One of these elements is my Thought Adjuster, the other my personality. The Adjuster part has an absolute quality and displays traits of the nature of its origin. My personality has inbuilt potentialities also derived from its origin. Between them they can generate a soul. Additional potentials that contribute to soul-building stem from a mind and spirit endowment derived from the Universe Mother Spirit and a material body and brain, the evolutionary result of the work of the Life Carriers. Other  influences derive directly from the Eternal Spirit and from our universe Creator-Son and indirectly through other celestial beings.

Personality has a unifying quality that enables it to confer identity and creativity upon the parts existing at any specific time that constitute the system that is becoming “me.” Some parts are dispensable or exchangeable. Cessation of soul growth is accompanied by loss of all the disposable parts leaving only the Thought Adjuster (that must now find a new undertaking), and my personality (which is destined to attain experiential deity as part of the Supreme Being). My identity, associated with my personality, is a transient phenomenon that becomes permanent only if I elect to survive. Otherwise it becomes, along with other disposables, as if it never was.

Assuming it is my irreversible intention to survive, then it is the disposable parts that dominate the making of that decision. The indispensable parts act mainly to guide and encourage. At the appropriate moment, Thought Adjuster, personality, and growing soul will coalesce to become as one and a new “me” will emerge. Having made it, I am now stuck with my decision—forevermore.

# A True Story


This story was heard during a BBC interview of a senior British policeman who was also a member of a Christian group within the police force. The interviewer asked how being a Christian might have helped the policeman during his police career. Here is his answer:

"Many years ago when I was a very young and raw constable, I was sent out in the company of a much older constable to bring in a person on a charge of sexually molesting a ten-year old child.

"The man responsible was a known sex offender and had already been identified as the probable culprit. We knocked on the door of the offender's home and I was taken aback at the courtesy with which my senior partner treated the man. We put him in the police car and drove him to the station where my partner again showed great courtesy, even offering the offender a cup of tea and a cigarette.

"This same gentle treatment continued throughout the interview and the subsequent arrest. When it was over, I was seething with resentment and anger at the way this criminal had been treated and I let my partner have the full blast of my anger. He responded, 'Sonny, if you have that attitude you will never make out in this job. Be angry at the crime but never at the criminal'

“In later years I gratefully recognized that this very old fashioned British policeman had taught me in a practical situation what Jesus long ago taught us—to condemn the sin but never the sinner.”

# Hinduism

“All Urantia is waiting for the proclamation of the ennobling message of Michael, unencumbered by the accumulated doctrines and dogmas of nineteen centuries of contact with the religions of evolutionary origin. The hour is striking for presenting to Buddhism, to Christianity, to Hinduism, even to the peoples of all faiths, not the gospel about Jesus, but the living, spiritual reality of the gospel of Jesus.”(1041)

And how difficult would it be to present such a reality to Hinduism, a religion which believes in reincarnation and karma? It appears perhaps not as formidable a task as might appear at first glance for Hinduism, “has proved to be the most adaptive, amorphic religion to appear on Urantia. It is capable of almost unlimited change and possesses an unusual range of flexible adjustment from the high and semimonotheistic speculations of the intellectual Brahman to the arrant fetishism and primitive cult practices of the debased and depressed classes of ignorant believers.” (1031)
Hindu theology, at present, depicts four descending levels of deity and divinity:


1. The Brahman, the Absolute, the Infinite One, the IT IS.

2. The Trimurti, the supreme trinity of Hinduism. In this association Brahma, the first member, is conceived as being self-created out of the Brahman—infinity. Were it not for close identification with the pantheistic Infinite One, Brahma could constitute the foundation for a concept of the Universal Father. Brahma is also identified with fate. The worship of the second and third members, Siva and Vishnu, arose in the first millennium after Christ. Siva is lord of life and death, god of fertility, and master of destruction. Vishnu is extremely popular due to the belief that he periodically incarnates in human form (Gautama Buddha and even Christ himself being claimed as incarnations of Vishnu.). In this way, Vishnu becomes real and living in the imaginations of the Indians. Siva and Vishnu are each regarded by some as supreme over all.

3. Vedic and post-Vedic deities. Many of the ancient gods of the Aryans, such as Agni, Indra, Soma, have persisted as secondary to the three members of the Trimurti. Numerous additional gods have arisen since the early days of Vedic India, and these have also been incorporated into the Hindu pantheon.

4. The demigods: supermen, semigods, heroes, demons, ghosts, evil spirits, sprites, monsters, goblins, and saints of the later-day cults. (1031)

Huston Smith (1965) in “The Religions of Man,” notes that the fact that Hinduism has shared her land for centuries with Parsees, Buddhists, Muslims, Sikhs, and Christians may help explain an idea that comes out more clearly through her than through any other leading contemporary religion; namely, her conviction that the various major religions are alternate and relatively equal paths to the same God. “To claim salvation as the monopoly of any one religion is like claiming that God can be found in this room but not the next. Normally each individual will take the path which leads up life's mountain from his own culture; those who circle the mountain trying to bring others around to their paths are not climbing. In practice India's sects have often been fanatically intolerant, but in principle they have remained notably open. The Vedas early announce Hinduism's classic contention: the various religions are but the different languages through which God has spoken to the human heart. Truth is one: sages call it by different names.”

It is possible to climb life's mountain from any side, but when the top is reached the pathways merge. As long as religions remain in the foothills of theology, ritual, or organization, they may be far apart. Differences in culture, history, geography, and group temperament all make for different starting points. How artistic,“ writes a contemporary Hindu, ”that there should be room for such variety—how rich the texture is, and how much more interesting than if the Almighty had decreed one antiseptically safe, exclusive, orthodox way. Although he is Unity, God finds, its seems, his recreation in variety." But the goal beyond these differences is the same goal.

In response to the question, “What kind of  world do we have?” Hinduism answers:

I . A multiple world that includes innumerable galaxies horizontally, innumerable tiers vertically, and innumerable cycles temporally.

2. A moral world in which the law of karma never wavers. As a doctrine karma means, roughly, the moral law of cause and effect.  In India the concept of moral law is seen as absolutely binding and brooking no exceptions. The present condition of each individual's interior life—how happy he is, how confused or serene, how much he can see—is an exact product of what he has wanted and got in the past; and equally, his present thoughts and decisions are determining his future status. Each act he directs upon the world has its equal and opposite reaction on himself. Each thought and deed delivers an unseen chisel blow toward the sculpturing of his destiny.

The idea of karma and the completely moral universe it implies carries two important psychological corollaries. First it commits the Hindu who understands it to complete 		
personal responsibility, and it also closes the door to all appeals to chance or accident. How many persons drift through life simply waiting for the breaks, for that breathless moment when his name will be called to fame and prosperity no more through merit than when a name is selected for a quiz program. If you approach life this way, says Hinduism, you misjudge your position pathetically. Breaks have nothing to do with protracted levels of happiness, and even so do not happen by chance. We live in a world in which there is no chance or accident; the words are simply covers for ignorance.


3. A middle world that will never in itself replace the supreme (the Trinity?) as destination for the human spirit.

4. A world that is maya, deceptively tricky in that it passes off its multiplicity, materiality and welter of dualities as ultimate whereas these are in fact provisional only. The trick lies in the way the world's materiality and multiplicity pass themselves off for being independently real apart from the state of mind from which they are seen. Reality in itself is actually undifferentiated Brahman throughout, as a rope lying in the dust remains a rope even while it is mistaken for a snake.

5. A training ground that can advance man toward the Highest.

6. A world that is lila, the play of the divine in its cosmic dance, untiring, unending, resistless but ultimately gentle, with a grace born of infinite vitality.

The beauty and truth of Hinduism's teachings were captured by Jesus and Ganid in their choice of quotations from the Hindu literature. (see 1447-1449)

# Concepts of the Absolute

The Absolute is a term used by metaphysicians to denote whatever is in no way dependent on or limited by anything else. Thus, in ethics an absolute value is one that is good in itself rather than useful for obtaining something else, and an absolute principle is one that permits of no exceptions. In political theory an absolute right is a right that society cannot take away from an individual.

In theology and metaphysics the term Absolute usually refers to God. According to the Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza, God is absolute; that is, unlimited, because by his very concept nothing can limit God. All other existing things exist through this absolute substance. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant defined the Absolute as an all-encompassing totality and argued that scientific knowledge of such a being is impossible. This position was adopted also by the British philosophers Herbert Spencer and Sir William Hamilton. The Absolute figures also as the central concept in the philosophies of the 19th-century German idealists. In particular, the German philosopher G. W. F. Hegel regarded the Absolute as a spiritual process that realizes itself through rationality alone, because only through the use of logic can reality be recognized. He maintained, as did the British idealist philosophers Bernard Bosanquet, Francis Herbert Bradley, and Thomas Hill Green, that all knowledge is indirectly and incompletely knowledge of the Absolute. The American idealist philosopher Josiah Royce identified the Absolute with a so-called cosmic community; his system of philosophy came to be known as absolute idealism.

# Judgment Day

Author: **Ann Bendall**

What a relief to discover that I will not be present at the proceedings which decide whether I survive or not. Prior to reading The Urantia Book, I believed that a dreadful ordeal awaited my death, and the life hereafter appeared to be going to commence with a terrifying process whereby I would be summoned before the judges who were faced with three choices - hell, purgatory or heaven. Admittedly, I already knew the decision, purgatory was definitely going to be my next abode. By a simple process of deduction, despite my many sins I had the utmost of faith in God being a tolerant-of-imbeciles type of parent and was convinced that He would give me a fair go because most of my sins were due to not discovering that my actions fell into that category until a post hoc analysis was undertaken. Heaven was definitely out, for I had no illusions about my status on the perfection score and Heaven was the place for perfect people who knew how to do perfect things all day every day.

Actually purgatory sounded much more appealing than heaven for this was the place where I would learn how not to commit 'sins' in the future, an art which I was convinced I would not acquire prior to my demise from this planet.

I was not enamored by the thought that on Judgment Day, prior to my transportation to Purgatory, I was going to be subjected to the embarrassment of my dirty linen being aired in public. However, as this was a mass trial, there were going to be millions of others going through the same ordeal at the same proceedings and, assuming they rostered the call-up on an alphabetical basis by the time they got to B maybe we had all been hardened sufficiently to the A's list of sins that mine would be merely a monotonous repetition of those who proceeded me in the roll call. After all there were only so many types of sins that a human can commit!

It was such a relief to discover that the Bible has it all wrong. Despite the revelators saying they can't tell us what happens when we die (1233), they give sufficient information on the two proceeding pages to satisfy me that I am going to be asleep throughout the whole Judgment Day process.

And whilst I while away the time on the borderland between mortal and morontia in blissful ignorance and peace, every personality associated with me prior to my death has to work flat out assuming I am going to awaken on the third day which, if Jesus' resurrection is any indication, actually is not 72 hours but 36 hours.

Whilst one of my seraphim cuddles my baby soul, the other is required to prepare their statement of my survival character (whatever that is.) Then they have to sit down with my Thought Adjuster and compare notes. And it's not good enough for my seraphim and my Thought Adjuster to approximate in relation to how much of value I have, they must “essentially agree in every item of their life records and recommendations.” (1231)

This jointly agreed-to summary of my survival character has then to be given to some Universal Censors and  their reflective associates on Uversa, who are required to “confirm this data and do so without equivocation or reservation.” (1231)

Then it's on to the Memory of Mercy who “is a living trial balance, a current statement of your account with the supernatural forces of the realms. These are the living records of mercy ministration which are read into the testimony of the courts of Uversa when each individual's right to unending life comes up for adjudication.” (314) It is the task of the Memory of Mercy to show that, “the saving credit established by the Sons of God has been fully and faithfully paid out in the loving ministry of the patient personalities of the Third Source and Center. But when mercy is exhausted, when the 'memory' thereof testifies to its depletion, then does justice prevail and righteousness decree. For mercy is not to be thrust upon those who despise it; mercy is not a gift to be trampled underfoot by the persistent rebels of time.” (314)

Although I have no doubt that my credit might be very low, I have faith that all involved will decide on another challenge to their patience after which the,  “Ancients of Days flash forth the mandate of advanced standing over the communication circuits to Salvington” and “the tribunals of the Sovereign of Nebadon will decree the immediate passage of the surviving soul to the resurrection halls of the mansion worlds.” (1231)

This is quaintly called a “without delay” (1232)  survival process. In the meantime my seraphim, still clinging to my soul, and in anticipation of the Ancient of Days decree that I survive, generally hang around the resurrection halls of some mansion world (quite possibly the first) looking at the catalogues of appropriate morontia type bodies, so as to choose an appropriate one within which to house my soul.

At the same time my Thought Adjuster flits off to Paradise, "registers at Divinington, proceeds to the Paradise presence of the Universal Father, returns immediately, is embraced by the Personalized Adjusters of the superuniverse and local universe of assignment, receives the recognition of the chief Personalized Monitor of Divinington, and then, at once,  passes into the 'realization of identity transition', being summoned therefrom on the third period and on the mansion world in the actual personality form made ready for the reception of the surviving soul of the earth mortal as that form has been projected by the 	
guardian of destiny." (1232)

The next thing I know is that I am waking up on a mansion world with lots of kisses and hugs with my seraphim first on the agenda.  After exchanging anecdotes on the theme of “Boy, we/I  thought we would not make it”, we generally wander around having a jolly good time until the axe falls and before a tribunal I go. Despite the reprieve of the non-attendance requirement at Judgment Day, the rest of the paradise ascent appears to be one court case after another. Although I am assured that the courts and tribunals up there “are very different from the more primitive and material activities of Urantia which bear corresponding names” (373) and that I can “depend upon being dealt with justly, even mercifully.” I suspect that these tribunal appearances are where I learn to be “disappointment proof.”

Jesus described in the parable of the talents (1916) what the process will involve, stating emphatically after telling the parable that, “In the next world you will be asked to give an account of the endowments and stewardships of this world. Whether inherent talents are few or many, a just and merciful reckoning must be faced. If endowments are used only in selfish pursuits and no thought is bestowed upon the higher duty of obtaining increased yield of the fruits of the spirit, as they are manifested in the ever-expanding service of men and the worship of God, such selfish stewards must accept the consequences of their deliberate choosing.” (1918)

Of course the seraphic court advisers and helpers will be present, and it's their job “to see that all charges against mortal creatures are stated in justice and adjudicated in mercy.” As my defendants their job is to be primarily mercy ministers, however this justice component worries me, for I am told that there is a decided restriction on their role which effectively is to be “the exponents and exemplification of the element of mercy inherent in divine justice—of fairness based on the knowledge of the underlying facts of personal motives and racial tendencies.” (428) In other words, they can't have any case squashed because “justice demands the adjudication of every default in the climb towards divine perfection.” (428) All they can do is sit through my painful experiences and, through tribunal/court action after court action mount their defense based on my “creature nature.”

I find it somewhat unnerving to be given such a wealth of information about one court or tribunal or another all the way through the local and central universe. It's as if  the revelators want to prepare me for a future of perpetual litigation, and it is little consolation to be told that “the higher you ascend in the universe, the more certain you are to be judged by those of your own kind.” (487) It's like a juicy bone tossed to a toothless tiger.

Apparently there are a number that I am required to compulsorily attend due to myself being the focus of judgment and in addition there quite possibly will be a number of additional court actions expeditiously taken out to examine certain developmental traits undesirous of a progressive God child demonstrated by behavior which wreaks, or has the potential to, wreak havoc amongst the locals of the planet on which I currently have been let loose upon.

And so as I ignorantly trip my way through the Paradise ascent I prepare myself for the shudder of panic which will sweep me into reality as a Celestial Guardian saunters towards me carrying the decision of the prior tribunal and quite possibly a summons for the next at the same time (252)

# Twinkle, Twinkle

Dick Bain, USA

Astronomers use various types of standard candles or cosmic yardsticks to measure distances to stars and galaxies. One of these yardsticks is the class of stars known as the Cepheid variable stars.  One of the apparent errors in The Urantia Book comes from using the distance to the Andromeda galaxy that astronomers held in the 1930's. This distance was determined using Cepheid variable stars in M31, also called the Andromeda galaxy.

Henrietta Leavitt, a Harvard astronomer, determined in 1917 that there is a direct relationship between the luminosity (brightness) of Cepheid variable stars and the length of their period. The longer between periods of peak brightness, the greater the absolute luminosity of these stars. Using this relationship, astronomers can determine the distance to other galaxies by noting the period and apparent luminosity of the Cepheid variable stars in these other galaxies.

In 1924, the well known astronomer Edwin Hubble presented a paper to the American Astronomical Society showing that M31, the great spiral galaxy in Andromeda, is about 750,000 light years from earth. This distance is now known to be about 2.2 million light years from earth.  Hubble got the wrong distance to M31 because he was using Shapley's calibration of a period luminosity (P-L) relationship for Cepheid variable stars—which was in error because Shapley was unaware that there were actually two types of Cepheid variable stars (now known as Type 1 and Type 2 populations) having differing P-L relationships..

The authors of The Urantia Book tell us that it takes light from M31 a million years to reach the earth, which would make that galaxy one million light years distant from us. It is interesting that they extol the use of the Cepheid variable stars by astronomers to make this measurement: “In one group of variable stars the period of light fluctuation is directly dependent on luminosity, and knowledge of this fact enables astronomers to utilize such suns as universe lighthouses or accurate measuring points for the further exploration of distant star clusters. By this technique it is possible to measure stellar distances most precisely up to more than one million light-years.”  (456)

When astronomers first started using the Cepheid variables as standard candles, two million light years was about the limit of distances they could measure using this technique due to atmospheric distortion.  Now, with improved terrestrial telescopes and the now repaired space-based Hubble telescope, that range has been pushed out to 60 million light years or more.  Recently, this improvement in seeing has enabled astronomers to measure the distance to a galaxy in the Virgo cluster. The distance measured using Cepheid variable stars in the M100 galaxy was 56 million light years1. Being able to measure galaxies at this distance also allows the astronomers to determine a value for Hubble's constant, which is important in determining the age of the universe. Unfortunately for the current cosmology, the value of Hubble's constant they obtained indicated that the universe may be only 10 billion years old. This is rather embarrassing, because there are stars in globular clusters calculated to be as much as 16 billion years old.  Will the cosmologists be able to apply another patch to keep the Big Bang theory limping along, or are their backs up against the wall?  Stay tuned for the next exciting episode of “Cosmologists Meet Reality.”

A Galaxy Too  Far

Using the latest generation telescopes, astronomers continue to find ever more distant galaxies. The  most recently discovered record-holder was reported to be between 12 and 15 billion light years from Earth, based on the red shift of light from this galaxy. This galaxy is apparently five times the size of M31, the giant spiral galaxy in Andromeda1. Astronomers feel that these most distant galaxies were formed close to the time of the Big Bang.  But if so, there is a small problem.

The telescope is in effect a time machine. The further light travels from a distant galaxy, the earlier in the history of the universe we are seeing that galaxy. Since the newly discovered galaxy is perhaps 15 billion light years distant, we are seeing it as it was 15 billion years ago. The problem is that this galaxy is fairly well developed. It even appears to have either old stars or dust clouds from a past generation of stars1. If the Big Bang happened about 15 billion years ago, then this galaxy would had to have developed in a few hundred millions of years rather than in billions of years like later galaxies have.  Now someone has to explain how the first galaxies could develop many times faster than later galaxies or another crack may appear in the Big Bang edifice.  Tsk, tsk.

# Birth of the Solar System

Ken Glasziou


Discussing the origin of the solar system, The Urantia Book states: “As Angona more closely approached the sun, at moments of maximum expansion during solar pulsations, streams of gaseous material were shot out into space as gigantic solar tongues. At first these flaming gas tongues would invariably fall back into the sun, but as Angona drew nearer and nearer, the gravity pull of the gigantic visitor became so great that these tongues of gas would break off at certain points, the roots falling back into the sun while the outer sections would become detached to form independent bodies of matter, solar meteorites, which immediately started to revolve about the sun in elliptical orbits of their own.” (656)

The book informs us that this state continued, “for about 500,000 years until Angona made its closest approach; whereupon the sun, in conjunction with one of its periodic internal convulsions, experienced a partial disruption; from opposite sides and simultaneously, enormous volumes of matter were disgorged.” (656)

As described above, the initial periodic internal convulsions of the newborn sun appear to have been unidirectional and independent of the approaching Angona, and only at the sun's partial disruption did  matter get extruded from its opposite sides. Eventually, time will tell whether theorists come up with an explanation for such events.

The book states that the Angona system captured none of the solar matter, but our sun did capture material from Angona, among this being three tributaries which included three major planets. It adds, “the impact of the three tributaries injected new and foreign directional forces into the emerging solar system with the resultant appearance of retrograde motion.” (657)

The Angona system is portrayed as a passing dark giant of space, solid, highly charged and possessing tremendous gravity pull. At our present state of knowledge this could be a description of an astronomical system accompanying either a black hole or a neutron star. In the mid-1930's, both of these ideas belonged to the realm of science fiction, and even at 1955, the year the book was published, the concepts were more fictional than scientific.

Evidence for the participation of a secondary system during the birth of our solar system comes from the studies of meteorites (Dyson2). In a supernova explosion, a small fraction of its energy may be converted into the nuclear energy of unstable atoms of thorium, uranium, and plutonium, and small amounts of these radioactive elements may be injected into the interstellar gas. This appears to be the only mechanism that can create the special conditions for the production of such fissionable nuclei.

According to Dyson, the evidence that a local violent environment existed immediately before the birth of the solar system is contained in the presence of xenon gas in certain ancient meteorites which has the isotopic composition characteristic of the products of spontaneous fission of plutonium 244. It is likely that this violent environment and the origin of the solar system were part of the same sequence of events. Supporting evidence is provided by radiation damage in the form of fission tracks that can be made visible by etching. The meteorites do not contain enough uranium or thorium to account for either the xenon or the fission tracks. They must have contained plutonium at the time that they solidified. Plutonium 244 has a half life of only 80 million years, hence the meteorites must be as old as the solar system and must have originated close, in both time and space, to the event that gave birth to the sun. A possibility would be that the Angona system was the result of a supernova explosion, perhaps one involving a twin star system inclusive of planets, occurring in the order of about 100 million years before the time of formation of the solar system.

According to The Urantia Book, retrograde motion in any astronomical system is always accidental and the result of collisional impact of foreign space bodies. In our solar system, retrograde motion is exhibited by Venus, Uranus, and Pluto, as well as the four outer moons of Jupiter which orbit it in the opposite direction to its other twelve moons.3

The Urantia Book also states that 2 billion years ago our planet captured enormous space bodies that markedly increased its mass. (659) In “The Planets,” Henbest tells us that the peculiar composition of planet Mercury, plus other parallel evidence, has caused astronomers to now think that the birth of the “rocky” planets (Venus, Mercury, Earth, and Mars) involved collisions between bodies we can think of as giant asteroids or small planets.3

The Hubble Space Telescope has  uncovered evidence that must cause theorists to re-think ideas about the formation of planetary systems and the involvement of jets of material originating from newborn stars. In studying what The Urantia Book states about the origin of the solar system, readers need to keep in mind that it remarks that most planets have an entirely different origin. (466) Readers also need to keep in mind that because of their mandate, the revelators were restricted to using outdated mid-1930's scientific opinions but were also permitted to supply certain key pieces of enlightening information. (1110) 

One example of key information may be the time given for the origin of the solar system at about 4.5 billion years ago. (655) In the mid-1930's, Hubble's measurements of interstellar distances had indicated an  expanding universe having an age in the order of 2 billion years. These measurements underwent major correction in 1952 due to the discovery of two classes of Cepheid variable stars, a discovery that doubled the estimated universe age. The first radiometric dating of meteoric material was done in 1955 by Claire Patterson who studied the lead isotopes in chondritic meteorite material. The result indicated an age of about 4.5 billion years. This finding, now considered correct, could hardly have been the source for information in The Urantia Book, since its metal printing plates had already been completed. To incorporate such information would have required a major rewrite of the section on the origin of Urantia, and on the basis of unverified information supplied by an untested methodology that gave the meteorite material an age greater than the then current estimated age for the universe. However, as with all such information, truth is in the eye of the beholder, and its meaning is a decision for the individual. Lucky guess or ??? Your choice.

# Wave energy octaves

Frederick Beckner, USA


The Urantia Book states “In the superuniverse of Orvonton there are one hundred octaves of wave energy” ( 474). 

For those who have puzzled over this statement, Frederick writes: I believe the Urantia Book text should be interpreted as written.  If this is done then this text is correct.  If not, then this text is demonstrably incorrect.

The Urantia Book says: “The sun's rays constitute four octaves in the superuniverse scale, the visible rays embracing a single octave, number forty-six in this series.” (474)

If light is the 46th octave of wave-energy, and the center wavelength of visible light is around 500 nm, then the center wavelength of the first octave is equal to 2 to the 46th power (246) times the wavelength of the 46th octave.  This wavelength is 7.03 x 1013 times 500 x 10-9, or 35.18 x 106 m.  The frequency corresponding to this wavelength is 2.9979 x 108 (the velocity of light in m/s) divided by 35.18 x 106 or 8.52 Hz.  Obviously there is wave energy at frequencies below two-thirds of 8.52 = 5.67 Hz, the lower frequency limit of the first octave. Physical measurements have been made of wave energy phenomena at frequencies below 6 cycles per second.

Thus, The Urantia Book text is incorrect if one interprets it as meaning there are ONLY 100 octaves of wave energy.  If it is interpreted as written to mean there ARE 100 octaves of wave energy, with the 46th octave centered on the wavelength of visible light, then this statement is correct so far as the bottom limit is concerned.  The upper frequency limit can be calculated as follows.

The center wavelength of the 100th octave would be equal to a center wavelength of 500 nm times 2 46 - 100 (2-54).  Now 2-54 = 5.55 x 10-17, and thus the center wavelength of the 100th octave of wave energy would be 2.775 x 10-23 meters. This corresponds to a frequency of 2.9979 x 108 divided by 2.775 x 10-23 = 1.08 x 1031 Hz.  The upper frequency limit of the 100th octave would be four thirds of the center frequency of that octave or 1.44 x 1031 Hz.  The period of this frequency is 6.9 x 10-32 sec.  This time interval might represent the minimum possible time interval, or a quantum of time, although physicists like to think that they can calculate down to the Planck time of 10-43 sec.  In any event it seems quite plausible that there are wave energy frequencies at least equal to 1.44 x 1031 Hz, and if so, the Urantia Book statement is correct as written.  One can easily show that the wave energy corresponding to this frequency is about 9.54 x 10-3 joules, a modest energy indeed, about the amount consumed by a 100 W light bulb operating for one ten-thousandth of a second.

All the above calculations assume the book means an octave to be two frequencies in the ratio of 2:1.  My American Heritage Dictionary defines the word as follows (excluding other inapplicable definitions):


a) The interval between any two frequencies having a ratio of 2 to 1, or

b) A group or series of eight.

Note that it does not mean two frequencies having a ratio of 8 to 1.  Thus I believe the first of these definitions is what is meant in The Urantia Book text on this subject.

This brings us to the question of why this information was given at all. As we have shown, this statement imparts no additional physical knowledge above that which is already present on Urantia—at least IMHO (In my humble opinion).

[Sure, but who would have expressed it in this unusual way—and why? Ed.]

# Archaeology and The Urantia Book

Tin in Turkey

“Gold was the first metal to be sought by man; it is easy to work and, at first, was used only as an ornament.  Copper was next employed but not extensively until it was admixed with tin to make the harder bronze. The discovery of mixing copper and tin to make bronze was made by one of the Adamsonites of Turkestan whose highland copper mine happened to be located alongside a tin deposit.” (904)

Matt Neibaur contributed the following review emanating from the University of Chicago.

For the first time, researchers have found a local bronze-age source of tin in the Middle East, a discovery that proves that the metal that made the important alloy possible was not entirely imported from regions outside the area as had been thought, a University of Chicago archaeologist says. Assistant Professor, Aslihan Yener, in the University's Oriental Institute believes a mine and an ancient mining village she has found in the central Taurus mountains in Turkey demonstrate that tin mining was a well developed industry in the area as long ago as 2870 B.C. at the dawn of the bronze age. The site of the mine, Kestel, is about 60 miles north of Tarsus. Yener's work at the mine and at nearby Goltepe, an ancient miner's village, provides new insights into the development of the tin industry. Perhaps most important is her discovery that tin can be smelted at relatively low temperatures in crucibles. Other tin sites known to exist throughout the Mediterranean area could also have been sources of tin through the labor-intensive smelting the team recreated....

Despite the importance of bronze and the role tin played in its production, scholars have long believed that tin was not readily available in the Middle East. Cuneiform texts on clay tablets speak of sources to the distant east and researchers have believed that perhaps Afghanistan was the only likely location of tin mines. Yener's discovery shows that tin came from local as well as imported sources. Yener's work is part of a study begun in 1980 to identify sources of metals used in the production of weapons and other objects in the ancient Near East. Yener, a American of Turkish descent, began her work as a member of the faculty of Bosporus University in Istanbul. “I had not set out to find tin,” she said, "When I was being trained as an archaeologist, the standard view was that tin did not come from Turkey but from elsewhere during the bronze age....

Although the researchers had found tin ore at Kestel, some skeptics thought there was not enough tin to prove that the mine was actually a tin mine. Working last summer with tin experts from Cornwall in southwestern England, an area famous for its tin deposits, Yener discovered industrial debris at the mining village of Goltepe (near Tarsus) that provided clues about how the tin was probably smelted. Instead of evidence of only low-grade tin, one ton of tin-slagged crucibles with a 30 percent tin content was discovered at Goltepe. This establishes beyond doubt that tin-metal was being produced, and was the motivation for the mining and smelting industry.   

[So have the authors of The Urantia Book made yet another lucky guess? Or are they what they say they are? Your choice. Ed.]
