# Truth and Faith

Nabon was a Greek Jew and foremost among the leaders of the chief mystery cult in Rome, the Mithraic. While this high priest of Mithraism held many conferences with the Damascus scribe, he was most permanently influenced by their discussion of truth and faith one evening. Nabon had thought to make a convert of Jesus and had even suggested that he return to Palestine as a Mithraic teacher. He little realized that Jesus was preparing him to become one of the early converts to the gospel of the kingdom. Restated in modern phraseology, the substance of Jesus' teaching was:

Truth cannot be defined with words, only by living. Truth is always more than knowledge. Knowledge pertains to things observed, but truth transcends such purely material levels in that it consorts with wisdom and embraces such imponderables as human experience, even spiritual and living realities. Knowledge originates in science; wisdom, in true philosophy; truth, in the religious experience of spiritual living. Knowledge deals with facts; wisdom, with relationships; truth, with reality values.

Man tends to crystallize science, formulate philosophy, and dogmatize truth because he is mentally lazy in adjusting to the progressive struggles of living, while he is also terribly afraid of the unknown. Natural man is slow to initiate changes in his habits of thinking and in his techniques of living.

Revealed truth, personally discovered truth, is the supreme delight of the human soul; it is the joint creation of the material mind and the indwelling spirit. The eternal salvation of this truth-discerning and beauty-loving soul is assured by that hunger and thirst for goodness which leads this mortal to develop a singleness of purpose to do the Father's will, to find God and to become like him. There is never conflict between true knowledge and truth. There may be conflict between knowledge and human beliefs, beliefs colored with prejudice, distorted by fear, and dominated by the dread of facing new facts of material discovery or spiritual progress.

But truth can never become man's possession without the exercise of faith. This is true because man's thoughts, wisdom, ethics, and ideals will never rise higher than his faith, his sublime hope. And all such true faith is predicated on profound reflection, sincere self-criticism, and uncompromising moral consciousness. Faith is the inspiration of the spiritized creative imagination.

Faith acts to release the superhuman activities of the divine spark, the immortal germ, that lives within the mind of man, and which is the potential of eternal survival. Plants and animals survive in time by the technique of passing on from one generation to another identical particles of themselves. The human soul (personality) of man survives mortal death by identity association with this indwelling spark of divinity, which is immortal, and which functions to perpetuate the human personality upon a continuing and higher level of progressive universe existence. The concealed seed of the human soul is an immortal spirit. The second generation of the soul is the first of a succession of personality manifestations of spiritual and progressing existences, terminating only when this divine entity attains the source of its existence, the personal source of all existence, God, the Universal Father.

Human life continues—survives—because it has a universe function, the task of finding God. The faith-activated soul of man cannot stop short of the attainment of this goal of destiny; and when it does once achieve this divine goal, it can never end because it has become like God—eternal.

# On Communication with our Thought Adjuster.

The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind. (2097)

Better communication does not necessarily imply direct conversation. Two people who have a close personal relationship may have no need for verbal communication in order for one to sense the approval of the other for some action or decision they may take. The revelators appear to be somewhat pessimistic about the capacity of us Urantians to actually achieve direct two-way communication with our Thought Adjusters. This pessimism is related to the cumulative disadvantages accruing to us as a result of the Lucifer rebellion.

The revelators have informed us that the Thought Adjuster is an impersonal fragment of God that indwells the thinking centers of our minds in such a way as to be “a very part of the human mind.” They tell us that the “only means of communion with the spiritual world is embraced in the spirit endowment of mankind, the indwelling spirit of the Father, together with the outpoured spirit of the Son and the omnipresent influence of the Infinite Spirit.” (1680) It is the Universe Mother-Spirit who, through the ministries of the Spirits of Wisdom and Worship, initially prepares our minds for the indwelling of the Thought Adjuster.

As individuals, we “do not possess a segregated portion or entity of the spirit of the Creator Father-Son (Spirit of Truth), or the Creative Mother-Spirit. These ministries do not contact with, nor indwell, the thinking centers of our minds...” but do work in perfect harmony with the Thought Adjusters. (379). It is apparent from these statements that for virtually all contact made by superhuman sources with our minds, the final step takes place via the medium of the Thought Adjuster.

In view of the exhortation to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor, what should our realistic expectations be? We are told, “While the voice of the Adjuster is ever within you, most of you will hear it seldom during a lifetime. Human beings below the third and second circles of attainment rarely hear the Adjuster's direct voice except in moments of supreme desire, in a supreme situation, and consequent upon a supreme decision.” (1241) Hearing that voice in a moment of supreme desire or in a supreme situation is consequent upon a supreme decision. So what is a supreme decision?

On p. 1242 we are informed that seraphim may be assigned to the association of a human soul who has realized one or more of three achievements. One of these three is to have “made a supreme decision to become Godlike.” Hence the decision to seek to follow Jesus' injunction to his followers is one key to better communication with our Thought Adjuster. “And then Jesus went on to instruct his followers in the realization of the chief purpose of all human struggling—perfection—even divine attainment. Always he admonished them: 'Be you perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.'”

Even after having made such a supreme decision, it does not follow that we will have something resembling a telephonic communication with our Thought Adjuster. In the previous issue of Innerface, Ann Bendall suggested that “Jesus never really knew what God's will for him was, he simply did what he believed to be the best in any particular circumstance.” Ann then cited some pretty strong evidence from The Urantia Book in support of her assertion. Describing Jesus agony at Gethsemane, the book says, “he endured great anguish and suffered untold sorrow, for the perspiration rolled off his face in great drops. He was at last convinced that the Father intended to allow natural events to take their course.” (1969) Ann suggests that Jesus was finally convinced purely by the way things were developing, that he did not know for fact but by supposition.

Going back to an earlier stage in Jesus career—to the point where he was 29 years of age and had just completed the Mediterranean tour—the book tells us, “By the end of this tour Jesus virtually knew—with all human certainty—that he was a Son of God, a Creator Son of the Universal Father. The Adjuster more and more was able to bring up in the mind of the Son of Man shadowy memories of his Paradise experience in association with his divine Father ere he ever came to organize and administer this local universe of Nebadon. Thus did the Adjuster, little by little, bring to Jesus' human consciousness those necessary memories of his former and divine existence in the various epochs of the well-nigh eternal past.” (1424) By this time, Jesus was a highly advanced Urantian—yet it appears that his Thought Adjuster did not communicate directly with Jesus but rather through bringing fleeting visions into his consciousness. Perhaps this is a reason why the book tells us that:

“Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.” (2090)

If we have a clear picture of Jesus' life firmly embedded in our memory, then, in any situation in which we find ourselves, it may be possible for our Thought Adjuster to bring an appropriate snapshot of an incident in Jesus' life, or in one or more of his teachings, to provide us with guidance upon what our decision, response, action, or attitude should be.

“Though the Spirit of Truth is poured out upon all flesh, this spirit of the Son is almost wholly limited in function and power by man's personal reception of that which constitutes the sum and substance of the mission of the bestowal Son.” (379)

In other words, the effectiveness of the Spirit of Truth is dependent upon our knowledge of the life and teachings of Jesus—for Urantia Book readers, that means knowledge of Part 4 of the book.

In considering our expectations about guidance from our Thought Adjusters and the form it may take, we need to remind ourselves that, “No other being, force, creator, or agency in all the wide universe of universes can interfere to any degree with the absolute sovereignty of the mortal free will, as it operates within the realms of choice regarding the eternal destiny of the personality of the choosing mortal.” (71)

This would appear to rule out the rather childish concept held by many Christians and, undoubtedly, some Urantia Book devotees, that divine guidance during our daily routine consists of a series of instructions from on high telling us exactly what we should do in each circumstance that confronts us. And if we think that we hear voices giving such instructions we should give consideration to this statement: “A human being would do better to err in rejecting an Adjuster's expression through believing it to be a purely human experience than to blunder into exalting a reaction of the mortal mind to the sphere of divine dignity. Remember, the influence of the Thought Adjuster is for the most part, though not wholly, a superconscious experience.” (1208)

Having reviewed some of the negative aspects of Adjuster interaction, let's now consider means by which our communication may be enhanced. “The Spirit never drives, only leads. If you are a willing learner, if you want to attain spirit levels and reach divine heights, if you sincerely desire to reach the eternal goal, then the divine Spirit will gently and lovingly lead you along the pathway of sonship and spiritual progress. Every step you take must be one of willingness, intelligent and cheerful co-operation. The domination of the Spirit is never tainted with coercion nor compromised by compulsion.” (381)

The book emphasizes that it is our thoughts and not our feelings or emotions that enhance contact with our Thought Adjuster (1104) “But,” it says, “the mind that really discerns God, hears the indwelling Adjuster is the pure mind. 'Without holiness no man may see the Lord.'” We have to clean up our act before we can reasonably expect to make good progress.

Prayer is, for the main part, a phenomenon of man's intercourse with his own subconscious, yet there is a domain of prayer in which an individual does attain more or less contact with superconscious levels of the mind. (996) Meditation may also have a role for some, but the book states, “The contact of the mortal mind with its Indwelling Adjuster, while often favored by devoted meditation, is more frequently facilitated by wholehearted loving service ministry to one's fellow creatures.” (1000)

Speaking about young children, the book says, “With the dawn of creative imagination they evince a tendency to converse with imaginary companions. In this way a budding ego seeks to hold communion with a fictitious alter ego.” (996) During childhood, and much to the consternation of his parents, Jesus was apt to utilise this kind of technique to converse with his heavenly Father. The book discusses the effectiveness of prayer in facilitating contact with our Thought Adjuster in these words, “Enlightened prayer must recognize not only an external and personal God but also an internal and impersonal Divinity, the indwelling Adjuster. It is altogether fitting that man, when he prays, should strive to grasp the concept of the Universal Father on Paradise; but the more effective technique for most practical purposes will be to revert to the concept of a near-by alter ego, just as the primitive mind was wont to do, and then to recognize that the idea of this alter ego has evolved from a mere fiction to the truth of God's indwelling mortal man in the factual presence of the Adjuster so that man can talk face to face, as it were, with a real and genuine and divine alter ego that indwells him and is the very presence and essence of the living God, the Universal Father.” (997)

For most of us, it is dubious whether there is any better technique to learn to converse with our Thought Adjuster than that used by the young Jesus—this “alter ego” method. By its use it can become habitual for us to share both our thoughts and our lives with our Thought Adjusters. But in doing so, we should not expect to actually hear the voice of the Adjuster. It is the closeness of the relationship that develops that is important, as it provides the opportunity for the Adjuster to work with us via our superconscious minds. This interaction is vastly enhanced when we are totally familiar with the life and teachings of Jesus as provided in Part 4 of The Urantia Book because it provides a memory bank of relevant information and incidents that our Thought Adjuster can bring to mind for our guidance. It also provides a means of checking that what we believe to be guidance is indeed such—for in no circumstances will there be a clash between what we do and what we conscientiously believe to be the nature of God as revealed to us in The Urantia Book and in and through the life of Jesus—and we will feel truly comfortable with our decisions.
Are there indicators to show that we are living at one with our spirit guides? “The proof of fraternity with the divine Adjuster consists wholly in the nature and extent of the fruits of the spirit which are yielded in the life experience of the individual believer. 'By their fruits you shall know them.'” (64) And what are those fruits? “Loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace.” (2054)

What follows this quotation from p.2054 is probably the most severe and uncompromising in The Urantia Book and requires personal reflection by all serious readers. We should know it is there:

“If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead; the Spirit of Truth is not in them; they are useless branches on the living vine, and they soon will be taken away. My Father requires of the children of faith that they bear much spirit fruit. If, therefore, you are not fruitful, he will dig about your roots and cut away your unfruitful branches. Increasingly, must you yield the fruits of the spirit as you progress heavenward in the kingdom of God. You may enter the kingdom as a child, but the Father requires that you grow up, by grace, to the full stature of spiritual adulthood. And when you go abroad to tell all nations the good news of this gospel, I will go before you, and my Spirit of Truth shall abide in your hearts. My peace I leave with you.”

# Swann, Gardner, and The Urantia Book

In the previous issue of Innerface, we presented an account of Stefan Tallqvist's mind-boggling disclosure of two quite amazing “prophecies” that have remained undiscovered in The Urantia Book until brought into the light of day by Stefan.

We stated our belief that this new information is inexplicable in terms of human authorship of the book, which surely must be attributed to a superhuman origin. We now examine in detail the actual human source material that was modified in order to reveal what the book terms “missing gap” information. (1110) First we compare The Urantia Book statement relating to the radius of the electron with the source work of physicist W.F.G. Swann.

From Swann in The Architecture of the Universe. (1934): “The mass of the electron is so small that if you should magnify all masses so that the electron attains a mass of one tenth of an ounce, that one tenth of an ounce would, on the same scale of magnification, become as heavy as the earth.”

And from The Urantia Book: “If the mass of matter should be magnified until that of an electron equalled one tenth of an ounce, then were size to be proportionately magnified, the volume of such an electron would become as large as that of the earth.” (477)

By the turn of the century, the ratio of the charge on the electron to its mass was known with a high degree of accuracy, but a similarly accurate measurement of its charge did not come until Millikan's work in 1909. Once the charge was known, the electron mass could be calculated and was found to be 9.11 x 10-28g. On checking the calculations we find that Swann has used this known figure plus the known mass of the earth to calculate the magnification factor that he used to compare the relative masses of an electron and the earth.

The revelators have changed the comparison from the known mass of the electron and the known mass of the earth to that of the unknown size of the electron and the known size of the earth. This modification permits the calculation of an electron radius and gives the value of 2 x 10-21m. Remarkably, this value is within the range of the 1990's estimates obtained with advanced technology and is a million-fold smaller than the value that prevailed during the 1930's to 1980's interval.

Following Millikan's measurement of the electron charge, in 1910 Rutherford came up with a set of measurements indicating that the dimensions of the atom were in the order of 10-14m to 10-15m. In the 1930's, two views of the dimensions of the electron and the proton held sway, one being that both were Dirac point particles hence dimensionless, the other that both would have measurable spatial dimensions. Among those who held to the latter view, some believed that the radius of the electron could be estimated from the formula, r = e2/mc2 where r is the radius of the electron, e its charge, m its mass, and c the velocity of light. The value of the radius so obtained was 3 x 10-15m. This figure was quoted in  1932 literature. Later it was refined to 2.8 x 10-15m, but by 1983, experimental data combined with the new theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED), indicated that the electron was close to being a point particle with its mass and charge concentrated in a region smaller than 10-18m. (note that a true point particle should be dimensionless. However, David Bohm has pointed out that there remains an enormous relative distance between the estimates of electron radius and the Planck distance of 10-35m, a distance thought to be the smallest possible dimension for a material particle. Hence there is still ample room for the electron to have a sub-structure). The technology that enabled the new estimates of electron radius to be made is one that permits even single electrons to be trapped and manipulated for extended periods of time—three years for example.

Moving now to the revelators' estimate of proton radius, the relevant extracts from Swann and The Urantia Book follow. First from Swann: “Then we have the proton—the fundamental unit of positive charge—a thing 1800 times as heavy as the electron, but 1800 times smaller in size, so that if you should magnify it to the size of a pin's head, that pin's head would, on the same scale of magnification, attain a diameter equal to the diameter of the earth's orbit around the sun.”

And from The Urantia Book: "If the volume of a proton—eighteen hundred times as heavy as an electron—should be magnified to the size of the head of a pin, then, in comparison, a pin's head would attain a diameter equal to that of the earth's orbit around the sun.

The major difference between the two is that revelators have omitted Swann's term, “eighteen hundred times smaller in size,” from their description.

The statement that the proton is 1800 times smaller in size than the electron brought condemnation from Martin Gardner in his book, “Urantia: The Great Cult Mystery.” Gardner comments, “Swann made a monumental error when he said the proton was 1800 times smaller than an electron...”

Closer examination shows Swann was merely using the thought of the day. In 1932, the radius of the electron was calculated from the formula previously given, r = e2/mc2. Since e2 takes the same numerical value for both the electron and proton, and the proton mass is 1800 times larger, a proton radius can be calculated from this equation that would be 1800 times smaller than that for the electron. In performing the calculation for his comparison, Swann appears to have used a pinhead radius of about 0.5mm. Allowing the average radius of the earth's orbit around the sun as being about 1.5 x 1014mm, the magnification factor, K, in going from the pinhead to the orbital radius is:

K = 1.5 x 1014/0.5  = 3 x 1014

The proton radius, Pr, calculated from the electron radius of 3 x 10-12mm divided by 1800, is 1.6 x 10-15mm. If this is multiplied by the magnification factor of 3 x 1014, we get 0.48 mm, the approximate radius of Swann's pinhead, which confirms that this is what Swann actually did.

The revelators have totally changed the significance of the comparison by omitting the factor of 1800. Using a pinhead radius of 1.0 mm, the proton radius obtained is  7 x 10-18m, which compares well with a modern estimate of the Bohr radius of the quark system (7.7 x 10-18m). The significance of this estimate was discussed in our previous issue of Innerface. There, we gave reasons why this may be considered as the best estimate of the radius of the proton. [note if the pinhead radius is taken as 0.5mm, the proton radius becomes 3.5 x 10-18m, which is still of the same order of magnitude as that for the quark system]

The modifications to Swann's comparisons as they appear in The Urantia Book show unequivocally that the revelators not only knew what they were doing but also provided new knowledge that human science was not destined to uncover for more than another fifty years.

# Beliefs and Values

Author: **Ann Bendall**

“The process of striving to make sense out of a potentially overwhelming world of experience involves internalizing thoughts and feelings about what is right or wrong, normal or abnormal, good or bad, and so forth. These are the value judgments that serve to define the limits of experience.” (When Living Hurts, Michael Yappo, 1994) And it is a person's value system, more than any other single factor, that is the greatest determinant of what one is and is not able to do.

Morris Massey in The People Puzzle, 1979, described how personal values at the individual level have been determined in large part by the values that were dominant in society-at-large as the individual was growing up. Massey claimed that 90% of our values are integrated by 10 years of age, and close to 100% by age 20.

Massey further claimed that values only change when one experiences an event that is emotionally powerful enough to effect the very core of the individual. And since they provide stability in the face of an ever-changing world, we do not like to let go of our values.

What are our core beliefs and values? Are they of the society in which we grew up, those mostly acquired by age 10 and virtually all by age 20? Or have we been able to let go in order to permit our Thought Adjusters to replace them with values appropriate for a child of God?

Overlaid on our value system is an alternating pattern of rigidity or flexibility. Basically, rigidity is a means of self-preservation as we protect what we know and believe. The more limited our range of experience, and the more we have been indoctrinated to believe that there are absolute “rights” and absolute “wrongs,” the more rigid will we be. Then, by asserting the exclusive nature of our correctness, we are liable to attempt to control others via the pathway of inducing guilt, or through intimidation and other such negative tactics.

A value that, in essence, fosters an earnest desire to maintain stability in the face of change has embedded within it a number of other related values— such as a commitment to an ideal in spite of changing circumstances; or to maintaining an outworn tradition in the face of progress; or to “what has been” over “what can be.”

In order to take a step forward, the “rigid” individuals must be determined to leave behind those values that hold them anchored in concrete.

Flexibility is a more sophisticated response. It comes about when one is willing to accept that others can do things differently and still be “correct” in their actions. Unfortunately, in our current society, accepting that each person must evolve their own “right” way to live seems to require more flexibility than most people possess.

The “flexible” person, when confronted by external pressures or challenge in the form of adversity, is open to the possibility that a better, more adaptive, alternative may be found.

Floating around in society are numerous belief systems that are harmful in their potential to distort experience. Three such beliefs are:

1. Where there's a will there's a way—or stated another way—if at first you don't succeed, try, try again. This paradigm has equal capacity to either frustrate or to motivate. Often people invest increasing amounts of themselves in a cause of some sort, believing that through determination or commitment, success will be inevitable. And they will hold on, and on, and on, despite repeated failure.

2. All things happen for a reason. A seemingly ingrained and inherent characteristic of human beings is their need for things to “make sense.” When an event occurs, a search for the relationship between cause and effect begins. Then, when no apparent reason arises to explain the event comes forth, guesswork and imagination take over—and subjective speculation soon becomes objective fact. We human beings need to feel “in control.” Hence we tend to hold tenaciously to explanations that provide meaning—and restore our feeling of being “in control.”

3. There is only one right way to live. Perhaps the most rigid of the three belief systems, this particular one underlies deep prejudice and irrational violence on a broad level, and intrapersonal and interpersonal difficulties on a lesser scale. The message conveyed by the more dedicated adherent is “Do as you are told or risk disapproval, rejection, or even worse.” For an individual who is easily made to feel guilty and who values acceptance over self-validation, depression is a common consequence.

Introjected without much thought from parents and society at large, these values and beliefs are the fabric through which we, as adults, perceive life, ourselves, and others. It may be helpful for each of us to explore for ourselves, the values with which we have been indoctrinated during our formative years— and to consider whether they are now a help or a hindrance for our progress towards cosmic citizenship.

Can we rid ourselves of false values? “And when Jesus heard these words, he looked down into the father's anxious face, saying: 'Question not my Father's power of love, only the sincerity and reach of your faith. All things are possible to him who really believes.' And then James of Safed spoke those long-to-be-remembered words of commingled faith and doubt, 'Lord, I believe. I pray you help my unbelief.'”

# A God of Fundamentals Who is a Light, Not a Lash

Sydney Harris, U.S.A.

All this argument and controversy about the evolution of man, and no thought about the evolution of God. Fundamentalists and modernists disputing the origin of species, and no consideration of how our species has changed its view of God since the earliest times.

In the beginning, in the first books of the Old Testament, we find a vengeful as well as a gracious God, a tribal God exacting duty and devotion by ritual and sacrifice.

Then, as the Bible progresses, we find a strange thing happening. God himself changes, in the eyes of the Israelites. He becomes less fearsome and more compassionate; he expands from a tribal to a universal deity; as men grew in understanding, God grew in stature.

At first, he rejoiced in the slaying of Israel's enemies. But by the time of the Babylonian Exile, he was already depicted as a God who wept that the Egyptians were drowning in the Red Sea after the Israelites had safely crossed over. He cries, “Are the Egyptians not my people too?” (this may be found in Midrash, the earliest commentary on the Hebrew Scriptures.)

And by the time we reach the great prophets, such as Deutero-Isaiah, man has discovered a God who is far closer to the precepts and parables of Rabbi Jesus than most of us realize. Many of Jesus' sayings are direct quotations or paraphrases of the Old Testament, for he never considered himself anything but a pious Jew.

The evolution of God continued during his ministry, for he set about to reform and expand and deepen the vision of a loving and redemptive deity, placing the spirit above the laws that had come to cramp and rigidify the Old Guard fundamentalist Jews of his day.

The ministry of Jesus was a further liberation from ritual for its own sake. (“It is not what goes into a man's mouth that defiles him, but what comes out of it.”) It was an evolutionary breakthrough in men's conception of the Creator, and his relation to us.

Alas the church founded in Jesus' name (which I think would have shocked and scandalized him) retrogressed, as all establishments do, and became in  its own way as repressive and ritualistic and rigid as the synagogue he rebelled against, again placing law above the spirit.

God grows, as we grow, for he reflects what we become; and when we grow to the fullest, we will have the fullest God—not a God of the fundamentalists, but a God of fundamentals, a light, not a lash.

# Consistency in The Urantia Book: Personality

From a paper by Jacques Dupont, Recloses, France

Even for an author writing about recorded facts, consistency is difficult to maintain in a work as extensive as The Urantia Book. For hypothetical authors seeking to foist a fake revelation upon the world—hence relying upon their imagination— maintaining consistency would be a nightmare task. For authors presenting revelatory truth, even upon difficult topics where ambiguity intrudes, recipients of a revelation would justifiably have the expectation of a high degree of consistency.

The topic for this issue, “personality”  would have a “top ten” rating for degree of difficulty in maintaining consistency. There are more than 1000 references in the book from which to form a judgment. Those presented are mostly from a paper by Jacques Dupont, which was written to elucidate the topic of personality, but not specifically from the point of view of consistency. Judgment on consistency is in the hands of the reader. It is probably easier to look out for inconsistencies than to attempt a consistency analysis. Now from Jacque's paper:

A dictionary definition of “personality” is: That which defines the individuality of a moral person.
And for psyche: The function through which a conscious person understands himself as a self, a unique and permanent individual.

What is personality? One answer given in The Urantia Book that needs to be kept in mind is: “Personality is one of the unsolved mysteries of the universes.” (70-3) The book also tells us that: “The Universal Father is the secret of the reality of personality, the bestowal of personality, and the destiny of personality,” (8-5) that, “the personality of the spirit Son is the master pattern for all personality throughout all universes,” (1263-1) and that, “Havona is the home of the pattern personality of every mortal type.” (162-3)

We learn also that, “the Creator-Son uses the creatures of Havona as personality-pattern possibilities for his own mortal children,” (162-3) and the Creator-Sons themselves are, “perfect personalities, even the pattern for all local universe personality.” (28-3)

In The Urantia Book, personality and pattern are so closely linked that it would seem to be valid to assume, on occasion, that personality is pattern rather than personality has pattern. Perhaps that is part of the mystery.

We must be careful about how we interpret the word “pattern.” The master pattern for a car, for example, may still give rise to an enormous variety of cars that look and behave differently due to the addition, modification, or removal of components that leave the basic pattern unchanged.

The concept of personality as pattern may help with our understanding of other highly unusual characteristics attributed to personality in The Urantia Book—such as “changeless,” and “without identity.”

We Urantians have our unique personality bestowed upon us by the Universal Father prior to receipt of another unique gift from the Father, a pre-personal part of himself having divine personality that the book terms our “Thought Adjuster.” (194-3; 71-1; 1226-3)) Herein may lie a clue to at least a partial understanding of this mysterious concept of a personality having no identity of its own.

The “pattern” of the personality bestowed upon us is capable of being expressed in many ways but in only one way that will become “perfection.” A task of the Thought Adjuster is to aid us to achieve that perfection while, at the same time, leaving intact the free will our personality confers upon us. “The survival of identity is dependent on the survival of the immortal soul of morontia status and increasingly divine value. Personality identity survives in and by the survival of the soul.” (195-6) The “identity” belongs to the living system that will be reconstituted on the mansion worlds, not to the personality. The role of the personality is to unify that living system. (1225-2; 9-1)

There are far too many statements relating to “personality” for us to be able to explore all of them. A selection follows that ranges over the whole of the first three parts of the book. The profound concept of “personality,” as developed in The Urantia Book, is quite different from the customary loose usage of the word. It appears on more than 1000 occasions in the book, 86 percent being found in Parts 1-3.

The abbreviated quotations given below may shed some light on the importance and meaning of the book's “personality” concept while, at the same time, illustrating the remarkable consistency of its usage—despite the fact that many individual authors were involved in the writing of the Urantia Papers.

Personality is bestowed by the Universal Father himself or by the Conjoint Actor, acting for the Father.(1225-3)
Personality (of mortal man) is neither body, mind, spirit; nor the soul. (9-1)
Personality is bestowed upon the living and associated energies of matter, mind, and spirit, and survives with the survival of the morontial soul. (9-1)
Personality is integrating and supervising. (1134-3)
Personality is changeless in an otherwise ever-changing creature experience. (9-1)
Personality (human) and the Adjuster personality are changeless; the relationship between them (in the soul) is nothing but change. (1226-3)
Personality is basically changeless; that which changes is the moral character. (1572-7)
Personality unifies all other associated factors of individuality. (9-1)

Personality identifies man as a spiritual being. (1228-4)
Personality is uniquely conscious of time, and this is something other than the time perception of mind or spirit. (1225-2)
These few quotations present only a very limited portion of material in The Urantia Book relevant to  “personality,” but should be sufficient to demonstrate that the book is a work of intense and dedicated scholarship, not the dreamtime meanderings of a sleeping mind as proposed by Martin Gardner nor a slap dash book that Gardner claimed could have been written over a couple of weekends by one such as Dr W.S. Sadler.

A more in-depth study could include other related concepts such as “power-personality” that lead into consideration of the role of personality in the unification of God the Supreme and the Almighty Supreme in the Supreme Being.

Stanley McTrusty, a long term Urantia Book reader who is a professional mathematician, sent us his thesis on reality followed by a letter in elaboration. First the thesis:

The Universe and all it contains is Energy.
Energy cannot be created or destroyed.
Energy can only be changed from one form to another.
Therefore: Energy exists.
Potential energy—absolutely no activity
Kinetic energy (dynamic)—always has a beginning.
The appearance of the universe was initiated by a First Cause; brought about by a system of transformations; has laws to control the transformations, and the sustaining of these laws to prevent the vanishing of the universe back into potential energy.
This system and its laws indicate an intelligence far superior to mankind. This intelligence is responsible for the existence of the universe.
Therefore: This intelligence exists. (GOD)
Energy transformations require time and space.
Time: To provide an interval for the event to take place.
Space: To provide some place for the event to happen.
Mankind is an energy transformation. (subset of the universe) Therefore: Mankind cannot be First Cause.
Universal laws apply to societies.
Universal laws apply to individuals.
Proper use or misuse of universal laws (by ignorance or by design) is a matter of choice.
The freedom of choice makes societies and individuals responsible for their own actions—(free but responsible).
Choose proper use of universal laws—the results are desirable consequences.
Choose misuse of universal laws (by ignorance or by design) and the results are undesirable consequences.
Persistent misuse leads to self-destruction.

This is real religion. Once understood, it frees individuals and societies from the superstitions, wrong beliefs, rituals, the dogma of religious organizations, and from other organizations trying to control through fear and guilt.

Stanley's letter to the editor follows:

I am a mathematician—a left handed one at that. Having been born at a time when everyone thought left handers should be converted to right handers, the result is I am ambidextrous in nearly everything I do. This no doubt accounts for the strange or at least different way I think and do things.

In reference to your comment about 'energy' all I can say at this point is that it appears to be the 'stuff' God used to construct the universe.

All my life the so-called experts in science, religion, and politics have tried to convince me that there are no simple solutions to complex problems. I never have and still do not believe that this is true.

Complex situations are man's attempt to deceive himself a little and the rest of mankind a great deal. (My opinion—for these reasons):

Complexities—
1. Enable devious persons to hide their
true intentions.
2. Provide a means to transfer blame.
3. In religion it provides the means to produce a
convincing argument for the need of a mediator
between man and God.
4. Provides a means to transfer productivity.
5. Provides a means for distorting or masking truth.
6. Aids and abets the dissemination of false
information.
7. Provides a security blanket for lazy thinkers.
8. Etc.

Very complex physical phenomena can be expressed with very complex mathematical equations. By using allowable mathematical laws, the first equation may be changed to an equivalent equation less complex than the original. Through a series of these transformations obtaining less and less complex equivalent equations, we can finally arrive at a very simple and understandable solution to a very complex problem.

After years of accumulating information from religion and science, I decided to apply the mathematical procedures to this information. I reduced this information by trying to eliminate complexities. The rule I used was—is this complexity God-given or man-made—and eliminated the man-made. The result was: The universe and all it contains is energy.

This is the simplest form that I was able to reduce this information. When I got to this point I found myself dealing directly with God. I am absolutely and totally responsible for:
1. Proper use of universal (God-given) laws.
2. Keeping God's commandments.
3. Doing the will of God.
4. Choosing good over evil.
5. Loving God and man.

I found that I have defined a system whereby I can tell if I am choosing good over evil. The greater my skill becomes in making my choices, the greater is my spiritual growth.

God gave me the ability to choose, the freedom to choose, and gave me the responsibility for the choices I make.

To sum up: I need to do the right thing, in the right way, at the right time.

I have great confidence in what I have done and explained because it will help me to drastically reduce my transgressions of the Divine Law.

The Urantia Book states (p.18) “The Creators are the first to attempt to save man from the disastrous results of his foolish transgression of the Divine Laws.”

If just one person really understands what I have deduced in this summary, and if it helps them as much as it has me, I will have my reward.

# Cosmic Reflections: Mars: The Bearer of Life?

Dick Bain

Mars has always been of special interest to us mortals. To the ancients, the baleful red color suggested that Mars might be the god who visits wars on humanity. In Holst's composition, “The Planets,” the section about Mars is titled “Mars, the Bringer of War,” and the music of this section sounds warlike.  But Mars has also been seen as a place where life may exist. Percival Lowell, a well known astronomer in the early 20th century, believed that Mars is inhabited, and that the lines he thought he saw on Mars are canals used by the Martians to distribute water for irrigation.  He founded Lowell observatory especially to study the surface of Mars. While Lowell's ideas about an advanced civilization on Mars were generally discounted by other astronomers, the idea of some form of primitive life lingers on.

In 1976 two Viking spacecraft orbited Mars and each sent a lander to a selected site on the surface of the red planet. Each lander contained equipment designed to perform experiments on soil samples scooped from the surface of Mars. The results of the experiments were contradictory. One type of experiment seemed to indicate biological activity in the soil samples, whereas another type indicated no such activity. Many biologists feel that the apparent biological activity was due to some inorganic interaction. So the question of life on Mars has stood unanswered for 20 years. But now new evidence has reopened the question.

In August, 1996, the world's press surprised us when they announced that evidence for life in Mars' past was discovered in a meteorite found in Antarctica.  While the evidence certainly supports the case for the existence of primitive life forms in the Martian past, this verdict is by no means universally accepted by the scientific community. Some feel that non-biological processes could have produced the same results. Besides, the evidence for life forms is indirect. There appear to be elliptical objects in the rocks that could have been life forms and mineral deposits near these objects that are the same as those created by the decay of life forms on earth. The problem is that they are much smaller than any primitive life forms that have ever existed on our planet.

While the supporting evidence for life in Mars past is intriguing, unfortunately the jury will  be out for a long time unless the objections can be answered satisfactorily. But if we suppose that life did exist on Mars early in it's history, what are the implications for students of The Urantia Book?

The Urantia Book authors tell us that life, in a primitive form that they call “life plasm” on p.399, is implanted on a candidate world by the Life Carriers. This single-celled life form carries the potential to evolve into so-called “mortal will creatures” such as ourselves. According to the authors, the first true mortals emerged from the evolutionary process about 449,000,000 years after the original life implantation. (667;707) If it turns out that life existed on Mars millions of years ago, then it would appear that the Life Carriers were responsible for this life.

If life was implanted, but none exists there today, does that mean that the life implantation failed? The authors intimate that life implantation may not always succeed: “The Life Carriers of a planetary corps are given a certain period in which to establish life on a new world, approximately one-half million years of the time of that planet. At the termination of this period, indicated by certain developmental attainments of the planetary life, they cease implantation efforts, and they may not subsequently add anything new or supplemental to the life of that planet.” (400) So did the life implantation on Mars fail, or is evolution still progressing there?

According to planetologists studying data from various sources, Mars appears to have had rivers and even vast oceans of water early in its history. A billion years ago, it also had a carbon dioxide atmosphere several times denser that our present atmosphere. Apparently because of its lesser gravity and other factors, Mars has now lost most of its atmosphere and perhaps much of its surface water.

It appears that Mars would have been an ideal place to implant Urantia type life in those long ago ages. But undoubtedly the Life Carriers would understand enough of planetary evolution to predict its loss of atmosphere and water. Would they implant life on such a world? The authors of the book tell us that life can exist on a world such as Mars, so perhaps they did implant life there with the potential to adapt to the present conditions. “If intelligent creatures should exist on a planet with an atmosphere similar to that of your near neighbor, Venus, they would belong to the superbreather group, while those inhabiting a planet with an atmosphere as thin as that of your outer neighbor, Mars, would be denominated subbreathers.” (561)

An article in Nov. 1996 Scientific American  relates the conditions on Mars today. The average temperature at the equator is -76 degrees F! It does occasionally get warm enough to melt ice at the equator, but the ice is probably permafrost perhaps hundreds of meters below the surface, so we would not expect to see any liquid water in this area of Mars. There may be ice at the surface in the polar regions, but the temperature there would never get above the melting point of ice, so again, no liquid water is expected at the surface.

It sounds like a pretty inhospitable place, but life exists in some pretty inhospitable places on the earth.  Bacteria live in the steams of super heated water emerging from thermal vents on the ocean floor. A whole community exists around these thermal vents, all dependent on the non-photosynthetic energy conversion capabilities of the bacteria. In Antarctica, plants exist within rocks and survive temperatures as low as -100 degrees F during the long Antarctic winter night. Plants and animals exist on the tops of the tallest mountains, despite the thinness of the atmosphere and the cold temperatures. Further, the authors of The Urantia Book inform us that the Life Carriers can adapt life to exist even on a planet without an atmosphere. (563) There is little doubt that the Life Carriers could have implanted suitably adapted life on Mars, but did they? And if they did, what consequences would there be for us?

The scientific jury is still out on whether life existed on Mars. But if life existed there, and we agree with the origin of life described in The Urantia Book, then the Life Carriers placed it there. The question of whether or not life exists on Mars now cannot be answered until the next millennium. A sample of the Martian soil may be gathered and returned to Urantia as early as 2005, but there's no guarantee that a single sample from one location will contain the life we're looking for. I doubt that we'll be able to answer the existing life question until we can either send a sophisticated roving biological lab or mount a manned mission to Mars. The first option could probably be accomplished in a decade, but a manned mission may take several decades of preparation. So we are just going to have to wait—patiently, meanwhile using it as a character building exercise.
