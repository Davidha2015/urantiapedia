# All Urantia is Waiting

“All Urantia is waiting for the proclamation of the ennobling message of Michael, unencumbered by the accumulated doctrines and dogmas of nineteen centuries of contact with the religions of evolutionary origin. The hour is striking for presenting to Buddhism, to Christianity, to Hinduism, even to the peoples of all faiths, not the gospel about Jesus, but the living, spiritual reality of the gospel of Jesus.” (1041)

What is the “living spiritual reality of the gospel of Jesus?”  Three essentials are:

"First, recognition of the fact of the sovereignty of God.
Second, belief in the truth of sonship with God.
Third, faith in the effectiveness of the supreme human desire to do the will of God—to be like God.
And this is the good news of the gospel: that by faith every mortal may have all these essentials of salvation." (1586)

The same Paper tells us: “When God's will is your law, you are noble slave subjects; but when you believe in this new gospel of divine sonship, my Father's will becomes your will, and you are elevated to the high position of the free children of God, liberated sons of the kingdom.” (1588)

It would be expected that sincere devotees to the teachings in The Urantia Book would be well on their way to being free and liberated children of God. That also implies a desire, “to be like God.”

The book informs us that Jesus is the best model we have of God-likeness. So what was Jesus like?

"The unique feature of the Master's personality was not so much its perfection as its symmetry, its exquisite and balanced unification.

"The unfailing kindness of Jesus touched the hearts of men, but his stalwart strength of character amazed his followers. He was truly sincere; there was nothing of the hypocrite in him. He was free from affectation; he was always so refreshingly genuine. He never stooped to pretense, and he never resorted to shamming. He lived the truth, even as he taught it. He was the truth. He was constrained to proclaim saving truth to his generation, even though such sincerity sometimes caused pain. He was unquestioningly loyal to all truth.

"But the Master was so reasonable, so approachable. He was so practical in all his ministry, while all his plans were characterized by such sanctified common sense. He was so free from all freakish, erratic, and eccentric tendencies. He was never capricious, whimsical, or hysterical. In all his teaching and in everything he did there was always an exquisite discrimination associated with an extra-ordinary sense of propriety.

"The Son of Man was always a well-poised personality. Even his enemies maintained a wholesome respect for him; they even feared his presence. Jesus was unafraid. He was surcharged with divine enthusiasm, but he never became fanatical. He was emotionally active but never flighty. He was imaginative but always practical. He frankly faced the realities of life, but he was never dull or prosaic. He was courageous but never reckless; prudent but never cowardly. He was sympathetic but not sentimental; unique but not eccentric. He was pious but not sanctimonious. And he was so well-poised because he was so perfectly unified.

"Of Jesus it was truly said, 'He trusted God.' As a man among men he most sublimely trusted the Father in heaven. He trusted his Father as a little child trusts his earthly parent. His faith was perfect but never presumptuous. No matter how cruel nature might appear to be or how indifferent to man's welfare on earth, Jesus never faltered in his faith. He was immune to disappointment and impervious to persecution. He was untouched by apparent failure.

"He loved men as brothers, at the same time recognizing how they differed in innate endowments and acquired qualities. 'He went about doing good.'

"This man of Galilee was not a man of sorrows; he was a soul of gladness. Always was he saying, 'Rejoice and be exceedingly glad.' But when duty required, he was willing to walk courageously through the 'valley of the shadow of death.' He was gladsome but at the same time humble.

"His courage was equaled only by his patience. When pressed to act prematurely, he would only reply, 'My hour has not yet come.' He was never in a hurry; his composure was sublime. But he was often indignant at evil, intolerant of sin. He was often mightily moved to resist that which was inimical to the welfare of his children on earth. But his indignation against sin never led to anger at the sinner.

"The Master was a pattern of reverence. The prayer of even his youth began, 'Our Father who is in heaven, hallowed be your name.' He was even respectful of the faulty worship of his fellows. But this did not deter him from making attacks on religious traditions or assaulting errors of human belief. He was reverential of true holiness, and yet he could justly appeal to his fellows, saying, 'Who among you convicts me of sin?'

“Jesus was great because he was good, and yet he fraternized with the little children. He was gentle and unassuming in his personal life, and yet he was the perfected man of a universe. His associates called him Master unbidden.” (1101-1103)

Hmmm!—maybe some of us have some work to do.

# A Journey to the Stars

The Urantia Book describes, in detail, God's plan for the ascending evolutionary mortals of time to finally make it to Paradise. Here we provide a short summary about that marvelous journey which commences with our birth as beings only marginally more advanced than the animals. But there is a major difference—we are provided with the precious gift of a mind capable of both self-awareness and of making a moral decision.

For most of us that first moral decision occurs at about the age of five. Incredibly, it is the signal for the arrival of a fragment of God himself. Perhaps this is the more remarkable because this fragment of God actually volunteers to become our full partner in the journey to eternity. And that despite having complete prior knowledge of our truly lowly spiritual and intellectual potential for making a journey that requires us to attain perfection.

How high can you jump?

The first part of the journey is crucial in that we are expected to make a free will choice to seek to do the will of God that, ultimately, we may become like God. In his talk series, Bill Sadler once reminded us that we Urantians have a hurdle to jump and that the height of the cross bar depends largely on what we know and understand. If we are in full possession of the facts, the height of the bar goes up and up in order to correspond with our level of understanding. For those who are in possession of The Urantia Book, who have read it, assimilated its content, and understood its message, the bar is set far higher than, for example, an illiterate Palestinian street urchin who has been taught that Allah will reward him with guaranteed bliss if he contrives to kill or injure an Israeli soldier by throwing stones.

About that faint flicker

The book tells us that the faintest flicker of faith assures us of a second chance to make that requisite free will choice when we arrive at the next stage of our journey, the location we know as the Mansion Worlds. The book states:

“Now, mistake not, my Father will ever respond to the faintest flicker of faith. He takes note of the physical and superstitious emotions of the primitive man. And with those honest but fearful souls whose faith is so weak that it amounts to little more than an intellectual conformity to a passive attitude of assent to religions of authority, the Father is ever alert to honor and foster even all such feeble attempts to reach out for him. But you who have been called out of darkness into the light are expected to believe with a whole heart; your faith shall dominate the combined attitudes of body, mind, and spirit.” (1733)

For those Urantia Book readers who have taken this faintest flicker of faith phrase as a guarantee of survival, it may be advisable to take a close look at the last sentence of the above quote.

Can we be part-time seekers?

A requirement for kingdom-seekers is that they seek to do the will of God. A question having merit is whether it is possible to be part-time doers of the will of God. Can we complacently assess ourselves as qualifying for mansion world admittance because we do the will of God for, say, 90% of our time. A parallel example might be fidelity to one's spouse. Should our spouse be satisfied with the way we honor our marital obligations if we are faithful for 90% of the time—or even 99% of the time? Would a reciprocal performance from our spouses be acceptable? Most law courts of the Western World would score us a zero for even a 99% fidelity performance. So are the heavenly courts more generous?

It is worth noting that some believe that it is not possible to be a part-time doer of the will of God, that any purposeful and continued disregard of what we, in our hearts, really know is God's will for us means that our disobedience is total, that we are simply attempting to fool God by accepting some of his requirements while going our own way when God's will does not suit our intentions or purposes. If this be so, perhaps we might actually be unfortunate in having a Urantia Book to instruct us.

In my Father's house....

But let's take the optimistic view and assume we make it through to the Mansion Worlds, that we have arrived on Mansion World number 1, a satellite of one of the seven spheres that encircle our local system headquarters known as Jerusem. The general layout of Jerusem and functions for the mansion worlds are:

Mansion World 1 - functional as a deficiency ministry for correction of defects and deficiencies in mental experiences on Urantia.
Mansion World 2 - removal of conflict and mental disharmony is a priority concern.
Mansion World 3 - is where we gain better understanding of morontia mota and logic.
Mansion World 4 - here we learn about socialization - working in groups and classes.
Mansion World 5 - center for the linguistic schools. We learn about the constellation study schools and we become more universe minded.
Mansion World 6 - fusion with our Thought Adjuster usually occurs at this level.
Mansion World 7 - the purging of remaining genetic and environmental effects stemming from animal origins is completed here. By this stage all ascenders now have permanent seraphic guardians of destiny.
Jerusem, thence the Norlatiadek training worlds

Having made it safely through the mansion worlds, we then become eligible for Jerusem citizenship and a short holiday before we make our next move to the training worlds of our constellation of Norlatiadek. There we commence a rigorous socialization training in which we must learn to live and work happily with both similar and dissimilar beings.

This course will be no piece of cake, but after graduating from training world #70, we are received as a resident of the constellation headquarters named Edentia. At the “Assemblies of Paradise,” a supreme trinity-origin personality, a Faithful of Days, enlightens us about further aspects of our universe careers. All of this is to prepare us for the next move which is to our local universe headquarters at Salvington.

At Salvington

The physical arrangement at Salvington appears to be a standard one for other training locations—a central sphere encircled by 70 primary spheres, each having 6 satellites, making a total of 490 spheres. Together these make up the spheres of spirit progress that constitute the Melchizedek University. On arrival, we take up residence on the Melchizedek pilot world. Our seraphic guardians will be there on hand to help keep the anxiety level under control. Then, wonder of wonder and marvel of marvels, at the conclusion of our stay, our personal guardian will take us to stand face to face with Jesus of Nazareth, the Michael Son who is both sovereign of all Nebadon and God to his created children.

Starting at the bottom—again

We are now classified as a first-stage spirit being, which sounds grandiose, but we may be reminded that, once again, we are “bottom rung-ers”—for this is the bottom rung of that long ladder of spiritual ascent to the Universal Father on Paradise.

Our next stopover is at Ensa, a minor sector of the superuniverse of Orvonton. There, on the seven study worlds, we will carry out experiments and studies of a physical and material character to do with the activities of the Master Physical Controllers and the Supreme Power Centers. Those who have an aversion to physics, chemistry, maths, and such like will take comfort in knowing that we pass through only one group of the minor sector training spheres. We also get introduced to the Recents of Days in charge of Ensa before proceeding to the major sector of Splandon.

Splandon and prep. school

On advancement to the major sector, we attain the status of a second-stage spirit. Our new duties are dominantly concerned with spiritual preparation for when we graduate to the central universe of Havona. Studies here are primarily of an intellectual nature. Although registered only on the major sector of Splandon, nevertheless we must pass through all ten of the major sectors of Orvonton, and will see all thirty of the Perfections of Days in charge before proceeding to the superuniverse capital, Uversa.

At superuniverse H.Q.

On advancement to Uversa, we qualify at the third-stage spirit level. This headquarters of Orvonton is surrounded by seven higher universities of advanced spiritual training. Each is a cluster of seventy specialized worlds devoted to universe training and spirit culture, and make up the 490 university worlds of the superuniverse. On graduation from these worlds, we proceed to the shores of Uversa from where we depart for Havona and an entirely new and different facet of the ascension career.

Then Havona
The journey to the Havona receiving spheres is always made alone. We are through with the technical and administrative training of the evolutionary worlds of time and space. Now begins our personal education, our individual special training.

Throughout all Havona the instruction is threefold in nature: intellectual, spiritual, and experiential. But our first act on Havona will be to recognize and thank our transport seraphim for their loving service and care. After that we meet those who will sponsor our special activities and register our arrival. A time-out period is taken to prepare a message of thanksgiving and adoration to the Creator Son of our local universe who made possible our sonship career. Then comes some time for leisure and for the meeting of old friends.

Havona duties

Initially we are domiciled on the pilot world of the 7th Havona circuit, and are in the hands of the Graduate Guides whose task it is to prepare ascending pilgrims for admission to Paradise. After attaining identity comprehension of the superuniverse Master Spirit, we are advanced to the 6th circle as a fourth-stage spirit and placed under the supervision of the Supremacy Guides.

Attaining a realization of Supremacy qualifies us to be advanced to the 5th circle. The Trinity Guides undertake our instruction on the divine Trinity in preparation for our attempt to achieve personality recognition of the Infinite Spirit.

The 4th Havona circuit is the circuit of the Sons. From here, we make visits to Paradise itself in order to achieve an understanding contact with the Eternal Son. While on this circuit we also achieve a new comprehension of the nature and mission of the Creator Sons.
On advancement to the third circle the pilgrim comes under the tutelage of the Father Guides. The attainment of the Universal Father is our passport to eternity and also heralds our advancement to the status of a fifth-stage spirit.

On the 2nd circle, counselors and advisers begin our preparation for the great and final rest, an inevitable sleep which ever intervenes between the epochal stages of the ascendant career. On completion of the 2nd circle experience, the Graduate Guides issue the order admitting us to the final circle where we are in the custody of the Complements of Rest. Our time is devoted mostly to the study of the impending problems of Paradise residence. Near the end of this sojourn, we meet the Instigators of Rest and complete the preparation for the transition slumber, following which we are eternally resurrected on Paradise.

Havona tasks and stages summarized

7th Havona  Circuit - identity comprehension of the superuniverse Master Spirit.
6th Havona Circuit - attain a realization of Supremacy.
5th  Havona Circuit - achieve personality recognition of the Infinite Spirit.
4th Havona Circuit - achieve understanding contact with the Eternal Son.
3rd Havona Circuit - recognize the Universal Father; advance to fifth-stage spirit.
2nd Havona Circuit - prepare for the epochal sleep, the great and final rest terminated by resurrection in Paradise.
1st Havona Circuit - meet with the Instigators of Rest; complete preparation for the transition slumber.

Journey's end—and a new beginning

On Paradise, when we awaken from the transit sleep of time into the new experiences of eternity, we will be greeted by our permanent seraphic guardians who have been our companions from the early days of the universe career. Having been granted residential status on Paradise, we begin a progressive course in divinity and absonity. We must fraternize with upwards of 3000 orders of Paradise citizens and various groups of transcendentalers. And here, on Paradise, we actually “find” God as a person. We are designated as Paradise graduates after completion of a course with the Conductors of Worship. Then, on taking the Trinity oath of eternity, we advance to the level of a sixth-stage spirit and are thereupon mustered into the Mortal Corps of Finality.

The Spirit Stages of Ascender Progress are:

First-Stage Spirit - on graduation from Salvington, the local universe headquarters.
Second-Stage Spirit - on advancement to the major sector of Splandon.
Third Stage Spirit - on advancement to Uversa, the superuniverse headquarters.
Fourth-Stage Spirit - on advancement to the sixth Havona circuit.
Fifth-Stage Spirit - on advancement to the 2nd Havona circuit following recognition of the Universal Father.
Sixth-Stage Spirit - on taking the Trinity oath of eternity and being mustered into the Mortal Corps of Finality.
Seventh Stage Spirit - conjectural - possibly on attaining God the Supreme.

Where next?

As Finaliters, we are assigned on observational and co-operative service to the ends of the far flung creation. The expectation is that Finaliters will become seventh-stage spirits concomitantly with the attainment of God the Supreme.

The ultimate destiny of the Corps of Finality is unknown. Speculation has it that we will attempt to know God as Ultimate, and having attained that goal, we will begin the quest for the Absolute.

It might be a good idea to now read the Section entitled “Conductors of Worship” on page 303 of the book in order to get a feel for what this journey is really about. Bon Voyage.

# Need a Tune-Up?

What is it we can do to bring to realization the real power of a spiritual life that is perfectly attuned to the will of God for us? Jesus said, “By the old way you seek to suppress, obey, and conform to the rules of living...” (1609) Then he outlined a new way:

First we must be transformed by the Spirit of Truth.
We achieve this via a constant spiritual renewing of our minds—resulting in:
A strengthening of the inner soul so that:
We are endowed with the power of the certain and joyous performance of the gracious, acceptable, and perfect will of God.

How do we obtain a constant spiritual renewing of our minds? If you are already in unbroken and constant communication with your Thought Adjuster, you do not need the help Jesus offered. If not, one way to doing so is the way the youthful Jesus set about it via what the book calls the “alter ego” method. (996/7)

The young Jesus habitually and continuously informed his heavenly Father about the details, the comings and goings of his daily life—but with no presumption that God would respond in any other way than helping him to feel “right” about himself.

There is probably no better way than this for us Urantians to achieve the necessary “constant spiritual renewing of our minds.”  Try it and see.

# Out of Context: Means, Ends, Motives, and Morality

The meaning of almost any group of words within a text can be changed, often radically, by the simple means of quoting out of context. A facetious example would be: “Jesus was consistently cheerful, not-withstanding that he sometimes drank deeply.” We'll leave it to the reader to discover the real context which, we can assure you, is quite different from what it appears to be.

It's the motive that counts??

There are probably many quotes from The Urantia Book that have potential to do great harm if taken out of the context meant by the book. One of these is the subject of “motive.” In one instance, Jesus says, “In gaining an entrance into the kingdom of heaven, it is the motive that counts. My Father looks into the hearts of men and judges by their inner longings and their sincere intentions.” (1571)  In others, he says, “I look beyond the act to uncover the motive,” (1576) and, “the morality of any act is determined by the motive.” (1585)

Or is it?
Taken independently of the total content of the book, these statements on motive can easily be taken to support that infamous concept attributed to Count Machiavelli that, “The end justifies the means.” With it, Machiavelli perpetrated much evil, but his deeds pale into insignificance compared with the effect it had by its inclusion in the Communist Manifesto composed by Marx and Engels. Exploiting it, Chairman Mao is reported to have said that a nuclear war that wipes out virtually all of the world's population would be justified provided the few that remain are Communists.

Nowhere does The Urantia Book infer that an immoral act is justified by a supposedly worthy end. On the contrary the book states, "Moral acts are those human performances which are characterized by the highest intelligence, directed by selective discrimination in the choice of superior ends as well as in the selection of moral means to attain these ends. Such conduct is virtuous. Supreme virtue, then, is wholeheartedly to choose to do the will of the Father in heaven. (193)

In debate, we can always come up with hypothetical circumstances where telling that little white lie in order to gain a worthy end appears to be justified. In real life, the problem that inevitably arises is that more lies need to be told to cover the earlier misdemeanor and before long morality has disappeared down the proverbial pit.

# Attunement Equals Peace

Matthew Block, Chicago Il

In Paper 39, Section 5, p. 5-6  of The Urantia Book (437, 1955 edition), we are introduced to a group of seraphim, called the “Souls of Peace.” These angels belong to the order of Planetary Helpers, who begin their ministry on an inhabited world during the Adamic regime. As well as helping to foster the realization of “peace on earth and good will among men,” we are told that: “In the more advanced epochs of planetary evolution these seraphim are instrumental in supplanting the atonement idea by the concept of divine attunement as a philosophy of mortal survival.”

This description of their ministry is intriguing in its linking of peace and attunement. For years I've wondered why the supplanting of the atonement doctrine was so vital and relevant to the achievement of planetary peace.

Last spring the meaning of this linkage was illuminated by the discovery of a book called The Christ of the Indian Road, by E. Stanley Jones. First published in 1925, the book recounts the lessons learned through his experiences as a Christian missionary in India. After meeting resistance from Indians who were resentful of Christianity's close association with the perceived evils of the West, Jones made the decision to preach Jesus rather than Christianity. In its new emphasis on the life and character of Jesus, Jones' ministry immediately became vitalized and  far more effective. He soon realized that Christianity will be immeasurably enhanced by the insights of Indians who approach Jesus from an already rich spiritual heritage. The book's title refers to Christ as he is becoming “naturalized upon the Indian Road”—free from Western accretions.

The following paragraphs are drawn from pp. 204-6 of the chapter, “The Indian Interpretation of Jesus.” Emphasis has been added to draw attention to parallels with the above mentioned passages in The Urantia Book.

"Every nation has its peculiar contribution to make to the interpretation of Christianity. The Son of Man is too great to be expressed by any one portion of humanity. Those that differ from us most will probably contribute most to our expression of Christianity....

"The followers of the Christ of the Indian Road will show us the real meaning of a spiritual life. They will sit lightly to earthly things and abandon themselves to the spirit.

"Along with that will come the sense of the unity and harmony running through things. 'Don't you think atonement would mean attunement?' said a Hindu to me one day. He felt his life was 'like sweet bells jangled out of tune' by sin and evil, and to his mind, craving inward peace and harmony, atonement would bring attunement to the nature of God—music instead of discord. No wonder peace has been the great thought and craving of India. Anything like losing one's temper is thought to be utterly incompatible with the truly religious life. 'I know I haven't salvation yet,' said a villager to me one day, 'for while I have conquered everything else anger still remains, I haven't got it yet.' The followers of the Christ of the Indian Road will be harmonized and peaceful. Meditation to them will be real. Religion will mean quiet realization.

It is highly likely that the Melchizedek who wrote about the Souls of Peace found in these paragraphs both a clear indication of their influence and a cogent way of describing one aspect of their ministry. We are told that, while unable to inject new conceptions into our minds, seraphim often act to intensify some higher ideal that has already appeared.

Perhaps India's quest for inner peace, conditioned by future contact with the real religion of Jesus, will be intensified until it culminates in a growing acceptance of Jesus as the Prince of Inner Peace.

The Christ of the Indian Road contains other parallels with The Urantia Book, too complicated to be detailed here. Though out of print, it probably can be found in larger libraries and secondhand bookshops. Urantians involved in interfaith ministry will no doubt find it of great value, as will those interested in examining how the revelators utilized human-source concepts.

# Wrestling with Jesus

Dick Bain, Lilburn, GA.

In the book of Genesis in the Old Testament, we read of Jacob wrestling all night with a man who could be an angel or perhaps God. I have had my own wrestling match; it was with the concept of Jesus.

Before my encounter with The Urantia Book I was content to drift along with no theology except a hazy concept of God. My relationship with this person consisted mainly in giving God a call on the hotline      when I was in hot water or otherwise distressed. But Jesus and I had never been properly introduced. Of course, I had heard the name “Jesus' as in: ”Saved by the blood of Jesus.“ or ”Do you accept Jesus as your savior?“ or heard people sing ”What a friend we have in Jesus." Somehow I didn't relate to all this Jesus talk and Jesus singing.

Then I met the Jesus of The Urantia Book and it was no longer possible to ignore him. It began to dawn on me that his life and teachings were relevant to my life. Could I then have a relationship with this Jesus as the Christians do? What kind of relationship?  The king and his subject? Back slapping buddies? A teacher and his student? Complicating this is the fact that Jesus is a dual nature being, both human and divine. Neither being seems very accessible. The human Jesus has been dead for over 1900 years, and Christ Michael is perhaps a thousand light years distant. Nevertheless, the Christian claims to have a relationship with this Jesus, so it must be possible. But how?

In order for a mutual relationship to exist, there must be some sort of connection between the persons. Jesus said something about this connection, when he stated that he was present when “two or three are gathered in my name.”

The authors of The Urantia Book inform us that Jesus can be present with us through the Spirit of Truth. They tell us that when we contact the Spirit of Truth, we in essence contact the personality of Jesus or more exactly, the personality of Christ Michael, our Creator Son. (2062)

What does this contact feel like? The Urantia Book specifically tells us that when we encounter spiritual truth, the The Spirit of Truth reacts. From personal experience, I believe this feeling is spiritual satisfaction, perhaps even elation.

The Urantia Book and the Bible refer to The Spirit of Truth as the “Comforter.” Hence, when we are in crisis and feel spiritually comforted it may be the action of the The Spirit of Truth. Further, The Urantia Book indicates that the the Spirit of Truth may offer us guidance, so when we feel we have received guidance, this may also be the action of the The Spirit of Truth. And of course, when we pray, our prayers certainly are known by the The Sprit of Truth.

When we connect with the The Spirit of Truth, are we really contacting Christ Michael, or just a presence that is like him, but not him? Is Christ Michael aware of us as we are aware of him through the Spirit of Truth? Does it matter?

I believe that it is important to know that we are making contact with Christ Michael himself, just as we would rather talk to the person we dialed rather than an answering service person who will relay messages to the person we wish to contact.

It is difficult to imagine Christ Michael's consciousness being divided into millions of parts so he can simultaneously and directly contact all the people who desire such contact. Furthermore, the Spirit of Truth does not emanate directly from the Creator Sons; it is circuited through the local Universe Mother Spirit for them. Nevertheless, Christ Michael is a Creator Son, and we can hardly understand the limits of the powers of such a being. Since they are able to transcend time, perhaps they can make contact with more than one individual at a time.

At the very least, it does seem possible for Christ Michael to commune with all those who seek his presence. If we were at a family reunion with 50 people, we could hardly engage all 50 individuals in conversations simultaneously, but we could certainly feel emotionally connected with all those present, and we could certainly go from group to group,      participating for a time in each group.

Regardless of any speculations we might make, or any theories we might devise, we are informed on p.2061 that the Sprit of Truth creates a  consciousness of Michael, not of himself. He also told the Apostles that he would be with them by way of the Spirit of Truth. What is said seems to indicate that somehow Jesus/Christ Michael is literally present in some way via the Sprit of Truth. If so, what do we need to do to insure his presence? What are the impediments to such a relationship?

The lyrics of one of the songs heard frequently on Christian radio stations informs us: “Jesus, Jesus, there's something about that name.” Many Christians, especially conservative Christians, probably have had a long term relationship with the Christian Jesus.      They feel a great affection or love for this Jesus. Some were taught that he is God and that he gave his life on the cross so we wouldn't have to spend eternity in Hell. Small wonder that some 	
worship him with such intensity.

There are many Christians who love Jesus simply because of his goodness. For those fortunate enough to have such a relationship prior to reading The Urantia Book, and who are not limited by conservative theology, no doubt the picture of Jesus in the book simply deepens the love and respect these folks already feel for him. But what of someone who knows very little of Jesus or has a negative impression of him because of negative experiences with Christianity? It may be difficult for these folks to move into a positive      relationship with the Jesus of The Urantia Book.

A problem some of us have with the name “Jesus” is all of the Christian baggage that comes with it. I have seen too many Jesus looking down at me in pictures or on plastic crosses with sad, teary eyes. Not that his death was without meaning, but if you do not accept the doctrine of the atonement, the plastic crosses and associated Christian myths about the meaning of his death only serve to distract us from the nobility of his life. I could never accept the idea that Jesus had to die on a cross before God would forgive me. Like the authors of The Urantia Book (see p. 60) I recoil at the idea of atonement.

Many of us find unacceptable the conservative Christian idea that only those who accept Jesus Christ as their savior or redeemer will have eternal life.  Because I have a bit of a problem with the Christian concept of Jesus, I have sometimes used his Jewish name, Yeshua, when I refer to him.

When I say Yeshua ben Joseph, I think of a rugged Gallilean who lived a life of courage and compassion. I think of a man who stopped in the middle of addressing a crowd to go into the street and comfort a woman who was carrying a heavy load. I think of a man who could laugh and enjoy a meal with his friends.  I think of a man who loved the little children. I think of a man who could pull in nets full of fish or plane a plank flat with the best of them. I think of a man who experienced the whole range of human emotions but who wasn't ruled by his emotions. But in Paper 196, its authors have put it more profoundly than I ever could.

When I think of negative experiences connected with Jesus' name, I especially think of our Jewish friends. I once worked with a Jewish fellow who grew up in a predominantly Christian neighborhood in New York City. He told me that when he was young, the older Christian boys called him a “Jesus killer” and burned him with cigarettes. Need I say that he had little regard for Christians or for Jesus? Unfortunately, it was the Jesus killer mentality that allowed places like Auschwitz to operate without much protest from the churches or the local population in Germany. Sad but true, the name “Jesus” comes with a lot of negative emotional baggage for some people. And all this raises the question: How will non-Christians react to another book promoting Jesus?

Of course, we can't ignore that The Urantia Book calls him Jesus, but I believe that as we attempt to introduce the book to non-Christians, we should be aware of their pre-existent ideas about Jesus and be careful to explain the differences between the Jesus of Christianity and the Jesus of The Urantia Book.

I think it is especially important to emphasize that the book does not teach that Jesus is God or the second person of the Trinity. I feel that this is especially important for the Moslem and the Jew for whom monotheism is very strong; and polytheism is strongly condemned. The Christian Trinity smacks of polytheism to such people. By tying Jesus to the Trinity and the atonement doctrine, Christian theologians may have sabotaged Jesus' appeal to people of the Mid East, as well as to some people of the Occident, such as Unitarian Universalists.

The irony is that sincere religionists who reject the Christian Jesus nevertheless already have a relationship with Jesus/Christ Michael via the Spirit of Truth but don't know it. The Spirit of Truth operates within our minds whether we acknowledge Jesus or not. Perhaps all that's lacking is for a two way relationship is acknowledgment that it already exists. It seems to me that the relationship would be enhanced if we know that it is the personality of Jesus that we are contacting. And the relationship would be enhanced if we would reinforce the actions that bring us into contact with the Spirit of Truth.

Probably most of us are already doing those things that would engage us with the Spirit of Truth, such as seeking truth, praying for guidance, and gathering together for spiritual purposes. Obviously, we are not all going to have the same relationship with Jesus, any more than our relationships with each other are uniform. Our cultural background and personal preferences will define and color all our relationships, including that with Jesus. But his mercy and graciousness of spirit make possible a joyful and creative relationship with each of us. But there is one final and difficult impediment to a relationship with Jesus/Christ Michael—ourselves.

All mutually satisfying relationships require several things; one is trust, another is honesty but perhaps the most difficult of all is the willingness to make a commitment. When two people decide to marry, they have to accept certain limitations that they didn't have before. This perceived loss of freedom has spelled the end for many a relationship because one party or the other lacked the maturity to make the supposed sacrifice.

The freedom to do what we please seems desirable, but the mature person understands that the pleasures of a good relationship far outweigh the illusory freedom of the uncommitted life.

Just so, the spiritual rewards of a relationship with Michael/Jesus far outweigh the freedom of doing our own thing.  And wouldn't it be comforting to have our elder spiritual brother there to hold our hand when we have to walk through, “the valley of the shadow of death...?”

“The doing of the will of God is nothing more or less than an exhibition of creature willingness to share the inner life with God.” (1221)

# On Seeing Others as Benefactors

Masami Saionji

All the people around us are there to help us encounter the truth. Their existence has great value for us. If not for them, our spirits would have no opportunity for advancement. We would lack the means for bringing out our divinity. We may find some people lovable, some hateful, some admirable, and some distasteful. Yet, each of them, through their connection with us, has a role to play in putting us on the path to truth.

If you cherish only the people whose role is to inspire your love, while you hate and dislike those who criticize, blame and judge you, you are treating the latter unfairly. It was your Guardian Deity (Angel?) who thoughtfully arranged for them to be placed around you, so that your spirit might evolve. This makes it all the more necessary for you to love those who hate, dislike, or blame you—even more than you love those who love you. This makes it all the more necessary to appreciate them. Their existence is precious to you. They are your benefactors—your guides to awakenment. If you are able to sense this profound intention of God, you have understood truth. You are walking the path to spiritual freedom.

Try creating a new use for the time that you have been squandering on doubt.

# Heaven won't be dull—despite the disbelievers

Sydney Harris, USA.

One of the deep convictions of people who do not believe in Heaven is that if a Heaven exists, it is occupied by dull people. “All my interesting friends,” these skeptics smilingly say, “will be in the other place.”
If they were right, then religion would be a farce and a fraud. But they are wrong, for nowhere in the Scriptures will you find the slightest suggestion that dull and respectable people have a pass to Heaven.

In fact, all the evidence in the New Testament points the other way. Jesus preferred to consort with publicans and sinners rather than sit among those Pharisees who thought it more important to wash their hands than to cleanse their souls.

Indeed his entire protest against the conformists of his day was that they were smug in their virtues, that they looked down upon thieves and prostitutes, that they were so busy observing the niceties of the law that they neglected to love and succor their less fortunate brethren.

The Heaven that the skeptic disbelieves in is not a Heaven that ever existed in the Bible—but only in the minds of sentimentalists and ignoramuses.

There is every indication that Jesus preferred generosity of spirit to scrupulous regard for the canons of piety. In this he was echoing the Old Testament prophets who constantly warned the respectable citizens that religion is a radical thing, that it must penetrate into the roots of a man's nature and change his total behavior.

Much of what passes for religious education is merely a kind of tepid moralizing. Piety has become identified with goody-goodiness, with primness, with the small, neat virtues so easily practiced by people who think thereby to escape the necessity of genuine brotherhood.

No man can know if there is a Heaven or not and each man has a right to believe or disbelieve—but what is the point of disbelieving in a Heaven that no thinking person can believe in or want to be in?

I would not want to spend eternity in a place inhabited by the dull, the unimaginative, the timid and the merely proper—this is not the Heaven of the Bible.

Heaven, if it exists, is populated by men and women who have learned how to love, widely and deeply and boldly, no matter how reprehensible their actions seem to be in the eyes of “good” people.

It is worth remembering that only one human being ever received Jesus' personal assurance of going to heaven. He was a thief!!

# Cosmic Reflections: Evolution of the Solar System: The role of chaos

The Urantia Book's story about the origin of our solar system is at variance with the popular, and often dogmatic, text-book accounts. Current thought indicates that, in any account of origins, there may be a high degree of uncertainty.

Commencing in the seventeenth century with Isaac Newton's proclamation of his laws describing the motion of material bodies and gravity, a new era opened up in the study of the orbits of celestial bodies. Using Newton's laws to explore celestial mechanics, astronomers soon showed that these deceptively simple mathematical statements appeared to capture the essence of how the universe truly works. As a result of their application, it was possible to envision a completely deterministic universe in which the entire past and future lay encompassed within this mathematical framework. The clock could be turned back or forward with ease.

It may perhaps have been good fortune that many of the known properties of the solar system are reasonably well described by these Newtonian concepts. But whether this is inevitable because the solar system, and others like it, are the only kinds of system that have sufficient stability to exist for any extended period is another question.

The complexity of what is known as the “three body problem” is illustrated in Fig. 1 which demonstrates the complex motions possible in a system of only three interacting gravitating bodies. An examination of Fig. 1 makes it obvious that the point and angle of entry of the small body onto the system will vastly alter the trajectory it will follow and that, indeed, the complexity of even this simple system is such that it borders on the unpredictable. Unpredictability is even better illustrated in Fig. 2—the billiard ball effect—in which it should be obvious that even a minute alteration in initial conditions would vastly effect the subsequent behavior of the system. For the astronomer, it is this kind of unpredictability that is included under the heading of “chaotic motion.”

The development of the clockwork universe concept was largely due to a brilliant French mathematician, Pierre-Simon de Laplace who formulated an idealized mathematical solar system that remained stable despite small deviations in the eccentricities and inclinations of planetary orbits. Laplace concluded that these small perturbations could not accumulate to wreak havoc on the solar system's arrangement. To him, all of nature functioned like his solar system—as a clockwork. In his classic statement on determinism, he said, “Assume an intelligence that, at any given moment, knows all the forces that animate nature as well as the momentary positions of all things of which the universe consists, and further that it is sufficiently powerful to perform a calculation based on these data. It would then include in the same formulation, the motions of the largest bodies in the universe and those of the smallest atoms. To it, nothing would be uncertain. Both future and past would be present before its eyes.”

Naturally, Laplace's pronouncements (which were backed up by his massive five volume treatise on celestial mechanics)  caused wide-ranging discussion. Some asked questions such as, “Imagine a large rock precariously poised on the top of a mountain peak. Toppled by the slightest shove, the rock could easily trigger a massive avalanche in the course of its descent down the mountain's slope—do such instabilities exist within the solar system?” Laplace did not think so, but when he tried to tame the moon's motion, he failed to account for all the details of its orbit. So do multifarious gravitational interactions also generate cantankerous mathematical behavior?

From the time of Newton, it was not unusual for large prizes to be offered for the solution of important mathematical problems. It was such a contest for a large cash prize to celebrate the sixtieth birthday of the King of Sweden on January 21, 1889, that tempted the most eminent mathematicians of the day to present their papers on one of the four topics suggested by the award committee. Among them was another French mathematician, Henri Poincare, the eventual winner, whose entry included the three body problem mentioned in our Fig.1. and concluded that although the equations representing three gravitationally interacting bodies may yield a well-defined relationship between time and position, there exists no all-purpose computational shortcut—no magic formula—for making accurate predictions far into the future. In other words the series that arise out of perturbation theory typically diverge. Thus there was plenty of room for the unpredictable (“chaos”) in a Newtonian system, and the question of stability could not be settled by examining the divergent series associated with solutions of the equations of motion for the solar system.

Despite Poincare's findings, the deterministic clockwork universe remained firmly embedded in twentieth century philosophy. A paper published in 1963 by Vladimir Arnol'd provided proof than any solar system, despite its potential for chaos, will, for all practical purposes, remain quasi-periodic, hence stable—provided that the masses, inclinations, and eccentricities of the planets are sufficiently small.

The outstanding question to be asked about Arnold's hypothesis is what constitutes being “sufficiently small?” Up until the 1970's, investigations on the motions of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Pluto ignored the possible effects of the inner planets. The planet Mercury revolves around the sun in 88 days whereas Pluto requires a little more than 1,000 times longer. Any direct calculation has to proceed in increments small enough to follow each planet and because nothing much happens in mere thousands of years, the evolution of orbits has to be tracked for many millions of years to yield meaningful insights. In principle, a sufficiently powerful computer could step through the necessary calculations but in practice, numerical integrations of the whole solar system required such enormous amounts of computer time that simplification and approximation became essential. Up to 1983, no one had traveled more than five million years into the solar system's future, and those who had traveled this far had seen no signs of irregularity.

A change in technology that occurred in the early eighties was primarily due to Gerard Sussman who seized upon the idea of designing a computer specifically for the task of doing the calculations required in celestial mechanics. This was followed up by collaborative work with astronomer, Jack Wisdom, to design mathematical techniques for exploiting the new technology.

Along with advancing technology, there arose more and more evidence for the occurrence of chaos (in the mathematical sense) in the celestial mechanics of the solar system. Wisdom and Sussman were able to identify elements of chaos in the orbit of Pluto, and Jacques Laskar, of the Bureau des Longitudes, Paris, came up with a study of the whole solar system (except Pluto) and showed that starting with as little a difference as 100 meters in the Earth's position at a given moment, it would be impossible to specify where it would be in its orbit 100 million years later. At the University of Toronto in Canada, Tremaine, Duncan, and Quinn carried out work of importance to Urantia Book readers who have taken an interest in the "missing' planet problem. In their studies of planetary orbits lying between Uranus and Neptune, they found that in roughly half of the cases studied, the orbit became sufficiently chaotic to ensure that, during some part of a five billion year period, any planetary body in that orbit would be likely to be ejected from the solar system.

In 1992, Wisdom and Sussman re-entered the fray with their second custom-built computer with which they were able to trace the evolution of the entire solar system over 100 million years intervals. In doing so, they confirmed the earlier work indicating the chaotic motion of Pluto and Laskar's more general result that the solar system, as a whole, displays elements of chaotic behavior. Models made by Gerald Quinlan of a hypothetical solar system containing just the four planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, showed that in his simulations of more than fifty randomly adjusted “solar systems,” a majority gave evidence for the development of chaotic behavior.

This recent evidence raises the question of whether the particular distribution of planets in our solar system is one of only a limited number capable of enduring because of having exceptional relative stability. Opinion differs about its having room for an additional planet without becoming de-stabilized. Some researchers suspect that any additional planet would be at risk of being ejected from the system. Others speculate that, several billion years ago, the solar system did actually hold additional planets, perhaps the size of our moon or Mars, that were subsequently ejected.

One of the more dramatic consequences of the chaotic evolution of planetary orbits is the effect it may impose upon the angle of tilt of a planet's axis. For the earth, the moon acts as a stabilizing influence. However with inner planets like Mars and Venus, simulations indicate the tilt angles may have evolved chaotically. If so, an alternative explanation is offered for the peculiarity of Venus which rotates about its axis in an opposite direction to its orbital motion. Laskar and his colleagues argue that, because of chaotic effects, the axis of rotation of Venus could have suffered severe tilting to the point that it actually flipped over, thus giving a spin contrary to its orbital motion. If so, Venus is simply “upside down.”

Among the concluding remarks in his recent book, Ivars Peterson asks: “How much of a role did chaos play in the formation of the solar system? Did the solar system settle down into its present configuration (with well-spaced planets following nearly circular orbits lying roughly in the same plane) within its first few million years? Or has it gradually evolved to its present configuration over the last five billion years? Were there other planets that have since been ejected? What is the Earth's true trajectory? Is it gradually nearing the sun, eventually to be swallowed up, or is it slowly drifting away into the depths of interstellar space?...What seems clear now is that the solar system is, on astronomical scales, no simple, well-regulated clock.”

The Urantia Book (656) indicates that there were actually twelve planets present soon after the birth of the solar system. If chaos in the solar system is a reality, then the number of planets may have decreased through some being ejected. But perhaps it is still possible for new planets to be discovered. An alternative hypothesis is that what were once planets in their own right have since become moons of other planets—or the reverse. Our moon is larger than the planet Pluto. Presumably if it escaped into a stable orbit, it would then be classified as a planet.

As bigger and better computers come on line, perhaps some of the problems arising from The Urantia Book's account of the solar system's evolution will be clarified. One of the more interesting suggestions coming from those who support the concept of chaos is that the “text book” account of its present configuration system having become stabilized in the first few 	
million years may be incorrect. Perhaps convergence of the book's account and scientific opinion may yet occur.
