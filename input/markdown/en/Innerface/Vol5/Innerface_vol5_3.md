# Rodan on "The Personality of God."

"By Monday night Thomas gave up. But by Tuesday night Nathaniel had won Rodan to believe in the personality of the Father, and he effected this change in the Greek's views by the following steps of reasoning:

1. The Father in Paradise does enjoy equality of communication with at least two other beings who are fully equal to himself and wholly like himself—the Eternal Son and the Infinite Spirit. In view of the doctrine of the Trinity, the Greek was compelled to concede the personality possibility of the Universal Father. (It was the later consideration of these discussions which led to the enlarged conception of the Trinity in the minds of the twelve apostles. Of course, it was the general belief that Jesus was the Eternal Son.)

2. Since Jesus was equal with the Father, and since this Son had achieved the manifestation of personality to his earth children, such a phenomenon constituted proof of the fact, and demonstration of the possibility, of the possession of personality by all three of the Godheads and forever settled the question regarding the ability of God to communicate with man and the possibility of man's communicating with God.

3. That Jesus was on terms of mutual association and perfect communication with man; that Jesus was the Son of God. That the relation of Son and Father presupposes equality of communication and mutuality of sympathetic understanding; that Jesus and the Father were one. That Jesus maintained at one and the same time understanding communication with both God and man, and that, since both God and man comprehended the meaning of the symbols of Jesus' communication, both God and man possessed the attributes of personality in so far as the requirements of the ability of intercommunication were concerned. That the personality of Jesus demonstrated the personality of God, while it proved conclusively the presence of God in man. That two things which are related to the same thing are related to each other.

4. That personality represents man's highest concept of human reality and divine values; that God also represents man's highest concept of divine reality and infinite values; therefore, that God must be a divine and infinite personality, a personality in reality although infinitely and eternally transcending man's concept and definition of personality, but nevertheless always and universally a personality.

5. That God must be a personality since he is the Creator of all personality and the destiny of all personality. Rodan had been tremendously influenced by the teaching of Jesus, 'Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.'

When Rodan heard these arguments, he said: 'I am convinced. I will confess God as a person if you will permit me to qualify my confession of such a belief by attaching to the meaning of personality a group of extended values, such as superhuman, transcendent, supreme, infinite, eternal, final, and universal. I am now convinced that, while God must be infinitely more than a personality, he cannot be anything less. I am satisfied to end the argument and to accept Jesus as the personal revelation of the Father and the satisfaction of all unsatisfied factors in logic, reason, and philosophy.'"

# "All Conflict is Evil"

Since we printed this clause as a quotation from The Urantia Book in the final 1997 issue of Innerface with a full stop (period) after the word "evil," we have had several reprimands of varying degrees of intensity. So our apology for that editorial error.

Typical of the comments is this one from reader, Gloria Colot, of Qld., Australia:

"It is essential that this statement be understood in its entirety, therefore the meaning of the word  'evil' should be clarified. There are four levels of human misconduct; error, evil, sin, and iniquity. On page 754 The Urantia Book tells us:

'"Error might be regarded as a misconception or distortion of reality. Evil is a partial realization, or maladjustment or distortion of reality. But sin is a purposeful resistance to divine reality—a conscious choosing to oppose spiritual progress—while iniquity consists in an open and persistent defiance of recognized reality and signifies such a degree of personality disintegration as to border on cosmic insanity.'

"It can be deduced from this that conflict may be evil but not sinful or iniquitous.

"On p. 1097, an apparent contradiction appears in this quotation, 'New religious insights arise out of conflicts which initiate the choosing of  new and better reaction habits in the place of older and inferior reaction patterns. New meanings only emerge amid conflict; and conflict persists only in the face of refusal to espouse the higher values connoted in superior meanings. Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation.'

"On page 51 there are nine examples of 'the uncertainties and the vicissitudes of existence....' Conflict seems to be inherent in all nine of these examples:

1. Is courage—strength of character—desirable? Then must man be reared in an environment which necessitates grappling with hardships and reacting to disappointments.
2. Is altruism—service of one's fellows—desirable? Then must life experience provide for encountering situations of social inequality.
3. Is hope—the grandeur of trust—desirable? Then human existence must constantly be confronted with insecurities and recurrent uncertainties.
4. Is faith—the supreme assertion of human thought—desirable? Then must the mind of man find itself in that troublesome predicament where it ever knows less than it can believe.
5. Is the love of truth and the willingness to go wherever it leads, desirable? Then must man grow up in a world where error is present and falsehood always possible.
6. Is idealism—the approaching concept of the divine—desirable? Then must man struggle in an environment of relative goodness and beauty, surroundings stimulative of the irrepressible reach for better things.
7. Is loyalty—devotion to highest duty—desirable? Then must man carry on amid the possibilities of betrayal and desertion. The valor of devotion to duty consists in the implied danger of default.
8. Is unselfishness—the spirit of self-forgetfulness—desirable? Then must mortal man live face to face with the incessant clamoring of an inescapable self for recognition and honor. Man could not dynamically choose the divine life if there were no self-life to forsake. Man could never lay saving hold on righteousness if there were no potential evil to exalt and differentiate the good by contrast.
9. Is pleasure—the satisfaction of happiness—desirable? Then must man live in a world where the alternative of pain and the likelihood of suffering are ever-present experiential possibilities.'

"Finally, on page 1729, Jesus said, 'The religion of the spirit means effort, struggle, conflict, faith, determination, love, loyalty, and progress.'"

******
Thanks Gloria for the thought and effort put into your remarks. Not all readers were as charitable with their comments.

After much consideration, we feel that, although our apology for the full stop at the end of the quote stands, the quotation, "All conflict is evil." is neither incorrect nor at variance with meanings and values within The Urantia Book. As an example, let's consider the following:

"All war is evil."

Can it be denied that enormous "good" of many kinds flowed forth from the World War 2 conflict? Some were the result of incredible new technological developments vastly hastened by the war. Others were in fields such as medicine—antibiotics, the use of metallic rods, screws, etc., to hasten the healing of broken bones, etc., (for which Jews in concentration camps were used as experimental guinea pigs). Does the fact that good can flow from evil mean that evil is not evil?

There are many degrees of conflict but in most instances even mild conflict can be avoided by something better. Rodan displayed considerable wisdom on this topic:

"My philosophy tells me that there are times when I must fight, if need be, for the defense of my concept of righteousness, but I doubt not that the Master, with a more mature type of personality, would easily and gracefully gain an equal victory by his superior and winsome technique of tact and tolerance. All too often, when we battle for the right, it turns out that both the victor and the vanquished have sustained defeat. I heard the Master say only yesterday that the 'wise man, when seeking entrance through the locked door, would not destroy the door but rather would seek for the key wherewith to unlock it.' Too often we engage in a fight merely to convince ourselves that we are not afraid." (1778)

Too often, also, we humans unnecessarily engage in conflict because it is a part of our human frailty that we simply like to win, or we actually enjoy the adrenalin flush that conflict arouses. But what of the losers who are, after all, our brothers and sisters?

So, until convinced otherwise, we stick with, "All conflict is evil."

Editors

# Red Alert

If one assumes that the Urantia Papers were the work of a group composed entirely of either Catholics or Protestants then, because of the many "Protestant-like" pronouncements to be found in the Papers, many students of religious history would most likely cast their vote in favor of the Papers having been the work of  apostate Protestants.

The Catholic study edition of the Good News Bible (Thomas Nelson, N.Y.) contains introductory papers by Roman Catholic scholars that reject the so-called "divine dictation" theory. Also in them we can find, "none of the authors thought of themselves as composing divinely inspired literature," and the Gospel of John "seems to have been worked over and re-edited by John's community over a period of several years." This kind of viewpoint makes biblical fundamentalism impossible.

In contrast, in his book, The Religions of Man, Huston Smith writes:

"The chief Protestant idolatry has been Bibliolatry. Protestants do believe that God speaks to man through the Bible as in no other way. But to elevate it as a book to a point above criticism, to insist that every word and letter was dictated directly by God and so can contain no historical, scientific, or other inaccuracies, is again to forget that, in entering the world, God's word must speak through human minds. Another common instance of idolatry within Protestantism has been the deification of private religious experience. Protestant insistence that faith must be a living experience has often led her constituents to assume that any vital experience must be the working of the Holy Spirit. Perhaps so, but again it is never pure Spirit. The Spirit must work through man so that what is received is never uncompounded."

Question 1: When at some future time, students of religious history formulate their opinion about The Urantia Book and its adherents, are they going to conclude that because the same kind of idolatries had become entrenched about that book, the Papers must have been the work of disenchanted Protestants?

Question 2: By how much have attitudes among Urantia Book readers been influenced by the Protestant thinking of their forbears?

Question 3: What effect will some current attitudes have on acceptance of the book by future generations?

# John Hyde—a Tribute

Ken Glasziou

Many readers who knew John Hyde personally or through correspondence and e-mail will have been bewildered and dismayed at the news of his death. But those who were aware of the many 'demons' that haunted John during his earlier life will perhaps presume that those demons got the better of him in a moment when he was caught off guard.

I knew John only through correspondence and through his contribution to Innerface International. But because of this, I had developed a profound respect for both his keenness of perception and the spirituality that shone through in his writing. The article that follows is composed from correspondence in our records. Regretfully, it is not possible to get John's approval but I can hope that his Thought Adjuster had some indirect input in helping to get it right. Farewell for the moment, John, until we meet again in the Mansion Worlds. In expressing his concerns about organizations involved in dissemination of  the message of Urantia Papers, John wrote:

"My involvement with the Coopers and The Circles have led me to a conclusion that we, as a movement, need to try to get away from the fierce aversion to "religion" that has so characterized the outlook  of many of our leaders as well as that of disaffected former "Christians" which form a large block of readers.

"Unwillingness to explore true spirituality is increasingly becoming an impedance to further growth of the movement, and the deadlock that we are approaching will, sooner or later, need to be broken somehow.

"I am a great admirer of the social support elements of the Jewish faith and the Mormon Church, and feel that, without some analogous development in the Urantia movement, we will never grow beyond a size roughly twice that of the present number of active readers.

"If we are to believe that the book is to have a major impact upon society, and a movement of some type is to be an element of that impact, then we need to pull our collective heads out of the sand and to stop pretending that our movement is significantly different from other spiritual or religious movements of the past. In doing so we may be able to learn something by observing the history of the early Christian Church, as well as the Reformation, and the early history of the Ba'hais, the Mormons, and the Christian Scientists.

"To bring those thoughts to fruition, an organization would be necessary, in effect an organized religion. And, in reality, no matter what it wanted to call itself, it would simply be another Christian sect!  I have nothing against that.

"There is a lot of confusion in the Urantia movement about the concept of true religion—which is an individual thing—and organized religion which is a group activity.

"There is no way forward if Urantia Book readers cannot recognize that these two activities are not mutually exclusive, that both are essential.

"In The Urantia Book there is a quote that states: 'True religion is the act of an individual soul in its self-conscious relations with the Creator; organized religion is man's attempt to socialize the worship of individual religionists...' (1616)

"The alternative to an organized religion is selfish retention of the messages of The Urantia Book by the individual for the individual—perhaps accompanied by the forlorn and almost inevitably misplaced hope that someone else will notice one's sainthood and benefit thereby.

"The bottom line is this: "The book alone, by itself, cannot and will not transform society. It will take transformed individuals, acting together.

"Persons who are marginally interested in religious affairs, if presented with The Urantia Book as possibly being a more fulfilling outlet for both their spiritual and group religious activities, will look FIRST at the effect the book has had upon its present readership. Only then will they decide whether or not to look more deeply into the book and what it represents.

"At the present stage of affairs, an approach of this kind will scare off the majority of  potential new readers.

"No observant outsider is likely to be impressed by either the individual or collective performance of most of the current crop of Urantia Book readers. At present we have the 'go fasters' and the 'go slowers,' (the original two factions), the 'pro-UFers,' the 'pro-Fellowshipers,' the 'channelers,' the 'Course in Miraclers,' the 'pot-smokers,' and the 'let's promote inner spiritual growthers.'

"Probably the two most divisive are the 'pro-UFers' and the 'Teaching Mission' channelers—but for different reasons. The former are intolerant of the vast majority of readers and the opinions they hold while it is the intolerance of the majority of readers that causes the divisiveness created by the dogmatic and vocal 'Teaching Mission' channelers.

"It is going to take some kind of miracle for such a divided and opinionated collection to ever have a cohesive and influential effect for the betterment of human society on Urantia. So what else is there?"

Maybe Rodan had an answer.

# Rodan on Prejudice and Goals

"Prejudice blinds the soul to the recognition of truth, and prejudice can be removed only by the sincere devotion of the soul to the adoration of a cause that is all-embracing and all-inclusive of one's fellow men.

"Prejudice is inseparably linked to selfishness.

"Prejudice can be eliminated only by the abandonment of self-seeking and by substituting therefor the quest of the satisfaction of the service of a cause that is not only greater than self, but one that is even greater than all humanity—the search for God, the attainment of divinity.

"The evidence of maturity of personality consists in the transformation of human desire so that it constantly seeks for the realization of those values which are highest and most divinely real.

"In a continually changing world, in the midst of an evolving social order, it is impossible to maintain settled and established goals of destiny.

"Stability of personality can be experienced only by those who have discovered and embraced the living God as the eternal goal of infinite attainment.

"Thus to transfer one's goal from time to eternity, from earth to Paradise, from the human to the divine, requires that man shall become regenerated, converted, be born again; that he shall become the re-created child of the divine spirit; that he shall gain entrance into the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven.
"All philosophies and religions which fall short of these ideals are immature.

"The philosophy which I teach, linked with the gospel which you preach, represents the new religion of maturity, the ideal of all future generations. And this is true because our ideal is final, infallible, eternal, universal, absolute, and infinite." (1774)

# The Smaller Beatitudes

[Adapted from the Catechist Newsletter, Dutton Park, Qld.,  January 1998]

Blessed are they who can laugh at themselves; they will have no end of fun.

Blessed are they who can tell a mountain from a molehill; they will be saved a lot of bother.

Blessed are they who know how to relax without seeking excuses; wisdom has surely overtaken them.

Blessed are they who know when they should listen; they will learn new things.

Blessed are they who take not themselves seriously; they will be valued by others.

Happy are they who take small things seriously and serious things calmly; they will go far in life.

Happy are they who smile copiously and frown not; theirs will be the sunny side of life.

Happy are they who are rich in understanding; they may be taken for fools, but that is the price of charity.

Blessed are they who think before acting and pray before thinking; they will avoid much blundering.

Blessed are they who can curb their tongues while presenting a smile; the Gospel has penetrated their hearts.

Happy are you when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and say all manner of evil against you falsely, yet you still recognize the God-Spirit in all whom you meet; for the light of truth shines forth in your life and you have found true wisdom.

# On the Serving of Palatable Food, "As We Pass By."

Author: **Ann Bendall, Qld.**

[Note: Ann is a practicing clinical psychologist]

The God Deniers.

A small, select population abounds this earth who take offence to the word, "God."

To these people belief in God is viewed as being puerile. But if you listen to their challenge, the word "God" is argued against as if designating a concept rather than a personality. On being questioned though, God deniers affirm that they reject both the concept and the personality images. However, I'm never quite sure if they are rejecting:

the Old Testament God
the biblical inconsistency of God
a God they would fear because of his power of  judgment if he did actually exist.

Such people will challenge God's existence in terms that convey a total lack of understanding of the primacy of mortal will.

As I strain my ears to listen, it is as if they are violently rejecting Moses' God but cannot conceive of Jesus' God. And this is acceptable to me, for if we judge by another's actions rather than their words, Jesus' God ended up by being Moses' God. After all, he did let his blameless son die on the cross instead of saving him! Or, alternatively, not even contemplating saving him! Then this God actually demanded that Jesus should become the sacrificial lamb, a blood sacrifice to atone for our sins!

Let's face it, if this was the only way we could be forgiven, God does not impress as anything other than to be feared. So is it not unfortunate that the Jesus' God who is Love, the God we discover in the Gospel and letters of John, was transformed into Moses' God through the symbolic debacle associated with the Pauline interpretation of the crucifixion?

With such God deniers, should we declare as Jesus did, "This man was not hungry for the truth," (1466) while feeling so delightfully smug at our "doing as Jesus did." Or perhaps we should strive to add to the knowledge that they already have, serving them "spiritual food in attractive form" (1474) when they appear to provide us with no basis upon which to add to?

To "add to" requires first that we attempt to understand such people. Many who deny the existence of God are actually denying the Church which, on Urantia, a long time ago claimed patent, copyright, and propriety right to God. (Any novice in history can identify that, almost from its beginnings, the Church became so politically and socially enmeshed in human affairs that it appeared to forget, or to rank as low priority, its role as spiritual sustainer and upholder.)

With these god-denying  people we could challenge the possibility that they may be throwing out the baby (due respect, beloved Father) with the bath water. However, be warned, modern 'intelligent' people take offence to any suggestion that their ideas have not been formulated except with the deepest of introspection.

Next, before relegating our god-denying brothers and sisters to the "not ready for the truth" category, we must acknowledge that the major difference between us 20th century mortals and those of Jesus' times, is that all folks capable of a moral decision now have a Thought Adjuster. So whether or not they wish to deny the existence of God is purely of semantic value, for all such people appear to be fully aware that there does exist something we might term "peace within."

These folk are also aware that when they seem to lose this sense of peace, they also lose "joy in life."

I am firmly convinced that if they can regain this sense of "inner peace," accompanied by its attendant sense of "joy of life," then it means that the pathway to their superconscious has become decongested thus making the formidable task of their Thought Adjuster a little easier.

Consequently (if it does not challenge or offend them), I feel comfortable in identifying God by a name acceptable to them such as "peace within"—which thus provides the basis of further additions.

Ironically, most of this population of God-deniers usually hold an inordinate amount of superstitious beliefs. They often believe in predestination on a day by day basis; they are quite partial to fortune telling, tarot card readings, talking to spirits, etc.

While our God-deniers may be highly capable of scathing and well thought out arguments against the existence of God, often based upon the historical hypocrisy of the church, they accept superstitious beliefs without question or analysis!

To date, having been quite unable to formulate an acceptable hypothesis to explain such illogical beliefs, I fall back upon the Melchizedek's statement, "evol-utionary religion is sentimental, not logical." (1007)

The God-usurpers.

There is another population born of the demise in popularity of the traditional Western churches that occurred in the fifties. This appeared to accompany the secular explosion, and naturally the Pentecostal -type movements gained popularity in such an environment. Was this the forerunner of the age of rank individuality that commenced in the early 70's and now has become a sophisticated art? I do not know.

Anyway, people really caught onto this "ask in Jesus' name and I guarantee you'll get it" concept. Jesus became a sort of Aladdin's lamp. People started praying for whatever they wanted with the sublime confidence that they could ask for anything at all in Jesus' name and he was bound to give it to them.

Why? Well they gleaned enough of Jesus to figure that he was a man of high moral fiber. Consequently he would hardly be the type to go back on his word. And I guess they considered that God sure did owe Jesus something for the rough times he had put him through.

Outside of the Pentecostal churches amongst the Western masses, the primacy of the individual was being exalted while the basic social unit upon which civilization stands, the family, was being destroyed in the process. Individuality came to mean independence, and rank independence negates the possibility of forming effective teams or groups.

And so, as the Pentecostals were praying to Jesus for goodies, the "primacy of the individual" adherents were chanting their affirmations and extolling the virtues of positive thinking. You simply had to ask and the "universe" would provide. All you had to do was to be the epitome of positivity, and whatever was requested was yours.

Alas, in this age with its heavy emphasis on education of the masses, it appears that, with education, we stifled the ability to think deeply!

These god-usurper philosophies have in common that the individual is the center, the controller of their universe—or would be if their thinking was positive enough. But, in the end, such God-usurpers have either to deny God's existence or depose him to a position of subservience to their wills. Curiously, the latter position is the actual one that our Thought Adjuster does occupy.

Unfortunately the god-usurper philosophy does not stop there. A position at the center of the universe poses major societal problems because we can't all be at the center. So what happens if it appears that one person has got it all. Jealousy, envy, and disillusionment are the result. Someone else occupies our rightful place, so maybe we have not been positive enough, or maybe Jesus is not that person of high moral fiber that we thought him to be.

At times, in brief moments of despair, as I watch our civilization crumbling, I gain solace from Psalm 12. I look at all the activity, the inventions, the amorality, the materialistic thinking, and those fine intellects with not a shred of philosophy in their memory banks.

In such moments, I feel relief that, despite the cry of the prophet, "Help, O Lord, for there is no longer anyone who is godly," it remains a fact that, though uttered such a long time ago, we have survived.

Sure a few civilizations might have come and gone, but we, the human race, have made progress. But have we? The only real progress is because, through the grace of God, Jesus did come to this planet.

To the Pentecostals and the individualists, I find difficulty in adding anything of value to them. They appear to be a population who will not be open to additional truth at least until they have experienced disillusionment. But why should they listen to mere me? They are the center of their universe. And why would they want to downgrade their position?

The God within-ers.   

Western opinion polls reveal that between 80 and 90% of people believe in God. Of the God-believers I have met, most will say without question, "I believe in God but I don't go to Church."

The latter comment is said by way of an apology which they seek to clarify by adding, "I feel I don't have to go to Church, it's as if God is everywhere, as well as within me...but I feel him more when in contact with nature."

Then there are the real thinkers who affirm, "I know God is inside me, but I don't like to say this to people because it sounds as if I am saying that I am God, and I'm not....I know what I mean and what I feel but it is hard to put it into words."

My heart sings when I meet such people. I am so grateful to God and Jesus, that Jesus decided to come down here, and that the world is far from that writer of Psalm 12. I do live in a different time, a time when most people have God within them, and know it. They pray lovely personal prayers, they have a truly honest personal relationship. But many get stuck on a sense of guilt that in their occupying of God's time, they are taking him away from the more needy.

To such people, I suggest that they look at the beauty of a butterfly, and explore its life cycle. I then suggest that no human could concoct such a creation. Hence, the mind of God must be infinitely and incomprehensibly superior to ours. And so it is conceivable to me that he can, at one and the same time, keep the stars in alignment, control gravity so planets do not crash into each other, and be within each and every person, helping at their request, giving to each their fill.

And if a person philosophically postulates, "I wonder what God wants of me other than loving him, I suggest that maybe if we look to the most perfect person to ever walk this earth, Jesus, and strive to adopt his philosophy and beliefs, maybe that might be good for starters. I also offer a qualifier that I have to search carefully for his words in the Bible, but have found another book which I find invaluable.

# To Drink the Cup

Author: **Ann Bendall**

A severely incapacitated client with whom I once worked always impressed me with his ability to cope with incredible pain. He had exceeded the specialist's expectations in his recovery to date and, a tall, fit, and stately gentleman, you would never suspect this person's numerous disabilities.

One day, when discussing his pain tolerance, tears came to his eyes as he advised, "every time I feel pain, I remember that poor guy, and think to myself, 'this is nothing in comparison.'" He was referring to being a helpless witness to an incredibly barbarous torture and death of a person approximately thirty years earlier. That person became an inspiration, motivating him to regard any and every injury he had sustained as insignificant in comparison. And this strategy was effective in enabling him to have a quality of life that defied medical prognosis.

Jesus on the cross, his head bowed, blood pouring from his feet and hands, and the wound in his side, was once the image I would recall (when I was not drowning myself in too much self-pity) and, like my client, I would think, 'this that I am going through is absolutely nothing in comparison.' But the experience of the cross was inconceivable to me, with my major disappointments being born mainly of destroyed dreams, or rejection from brothers and sisters, in contrast to physical pain.

Then I read The Urantia Book, and my inspiration when times are tough became the Garden of Gethsemane. (1969)

The midwayers use highly emotive language in describing Jesus' emotions and thoughts in the Garden, such as "the trial became more appalling;" "he endured great anguish and suffered untold sorrow, for the perspiration rolled off his face in great drops;" "he dreaded to leave them (apostles);" his "human heart longed to find out whether there might possibly be some legitimate escape from this terrible plight of suffering and sorrow;" "His soul was tortured by baffled love and rejected mercy. It was just one of those awful human moments when everything seems to bear down with crushing cruelty and terrible agony.;" "private loneliness, public shame, and the appearance of the failure of his cause. All these sentiments bore down on him with indescribable heaviness;" "he was isolated from his family in the flesh; one of his chosen associates was betraying him. His father Joseph's people had rejected him and thereby sealed their doom as a people with a special mission on earth."

I have no doubt that any adversity I may experience in life will pale into insignificance when compared to that which my inspiration, Jesus of Nazareth, went through!

"And, with dignity and courage he strengthened his mind by the strategy I call "creative imaginings" (but I'm sure the revelators would call something else). By using his human mind, he went back to the days of his childhood and to his early work in Galilee. At the time of this great trial there came up in his mind many of the pleasant scenes of his earthly ministry. And it was from these old memories of Nazareth, Capernaum, Mount Hermon, and of the sunrise and sunset on the shimmering Sea of Galilee that he soothed himself as he made his human heart strong and ready to encounter the traitor who should soon betray him."

# Learning About God

The Urantia Book  (pp.1856-1857).

You learn about God from Jesus by observing the divinity of his life, not by depending on his teachings. From the life of the Master:


you may each assimilate that concept of God which represents the measure of your capacity to perceive realities spiritual and divine, truths real and eternal.

The finite can never hope to comprehend the Infinite except as the Infinite was focalized in the time-space personality of the finite experience of the human life of Jesus of Nazareth.

Jesus well knew that God can be known only by the realities of experience; never can he be understood by the mere teaching of the mind. Jesus taught his apostles that, while they never could fully understand God, they could most certainly know him, even as they had known the Son of Man. You can know God, not by understanding what Jesus said, but by knowing what Jesus was.

Jesus was a revelation of God.

Except when quoting the Hebrew scriptures, Jesus referred to Deity by only two names: God and Father. And when the Master made reference to his Father as God, he usually employed the Hebrew word (Elohim) signifying the plural God (the Trinity) and not the word Yahweh, which stood for the progressive conception of the tribal God of the Jews.

Jesus never called the Father a king, and he very much regretted that the Jewish hope for a restored kingdom and John's proclamation of a coming kingdom made it necessary for him to denominate his proposed spiritual brotherhood, "the kingdom of heaven."

With the one exception—the declaration that "God is spirit"—Jesus never referred to Deity in any manner other than in terms descriptive of his own personal relationship with the First Source and Center of Paradise.

Jesus employed the word God to designate the idea of Deity.

He employed the word Father to designate the experience of knowing God.

When the word Father is employed to denote God, it should be understood in its largest possible meaning.

The word God cannot be defined and therefore stands for the infinite concept of the Father.

The term Father, being capable of partial definition, may be employed to represent the human concept of the divine Father as he is associated with man during the course of mortal existence.

Jesus never claimed to be the manifestation of Elohim (God) in the flesh. He never declared that he was a revelation of Elohim (God) to the worlds. He never taught that he who had seen him had seen Elohim (God). But he did proclaim himself as the revelation of the Father in the flesh, and he did say that whoso had seen him had seen the Father. As the divine Son he claimed to represent only the Father.

He was, indeed, the Son of even the Elohim God; but in the likeness of mortal flesh.

To the mortal sons of God, he chose to limit his life revelation to the portrayal of his Father's character in so far as such a revelation might be comprehensible to mortal man.

To the Jews, Elohim was the God of gods, while Yahweh was the God of Israel. Jesus accepted the concept of Elohim and called this supreme group of beings God. In the place of the concept of Yahweh, the racial deity, he introduced:

the idea of the fatherhood of God.

the idea of a world-wide brotherhood of man.

He exalted the Yahweh concept of a deified racial Father to the idea of a Father of all the children of men, a divine Father of the individual believer. And he further taught that this God of universes and this Father of all men were one and the same Paradise Deity.

As regards the character of the other persons of the Paradise Trinity, we shall have to be content with the teaching that they are altogether like the Father, who has been revealed in personal portraiture in the life of his incarnated Son, Jesus of Nazareth.

Although Jesus revealed the true nature of the heavenly Father in his earth life, he taught little about him. In fact, he taught only two things:

that God in himself is spirit.

that, in all matters of relationship with his creatures, he is a Father.

On this evening Jesus made the final pronouncement of his relationship with God when he declared: "I have come out from the Father, and I have come into the world; again, I will leave the world and go to the Father."
But mark you! never did Jesus say, "Whoso has heard me has heard God." But he did say, "He who has seen me has seen the Father."

To hear Jesus' teaching is not equivalent to knowing God, but to see Jesus is an experience which in itself is a revelation of the Father to the soul. The God of universes rules the far-flung creation, but it is the Father in heaven who sends forth his spirit to dwell within your minds.

Jesus is the spiritual lens in human likeness which makes visible to the material creature Him who is invisible. He is your elder brother who, in the flesh, makes known to you a Being of infinite attributes whom not even the celestial hosts can presume fully to understand. But all of this must consist in the personal experience of the individual believer.

God who is spirit can be known only as a spiritual experience.

God can be revealed to the finite sons of the material worlds, by the divine Son of the spiritual realms, only as a Father.

You can know the Eternal as a Father; you can worship him as the God of universes, the infinite Creator of all existences.

The text of page 1857 of The Urantia Book tells us that, through its revelation of his life, we are enabled to "see" Jesus. This "mind-vision" can only come because of a thorough familiarity with that life and the way Jesus lived it. When we do acquire that familiarity, it becomes possible to experience a revelation of the Father to our souls.

The big advantage of knowing the life of Jesus comes because, in virtually any situation that we find ourselves, we can ask our Thought Adjuster, "What would Jesus do?" And since we already have a pictorial representation of Jesus' life stored in the memory banks of our minds, we facilitate the Thought Adjuster's ability to communicate an answer.

We are blessed with this gift. Its effectiveness is in our own hands.

# Cosmic Reflections: Human Sources of The Urantia Book

Ken Glasziou, Qld., Australia

In our previous issue, we discussed an article written by Dr G. Gamow in 1942 entitled Neutrinos VS Supernovae that was published in that year's January issue of the journal, The Scientific Monthly. This article had been identified by Matthew Block as being one of the sources for statements in The Urantia Book about the collapse of aging stars. Also mentioned was a long-suppressed document in which Dr Sadler noted that additions and alterations had been made to the Urantia Papers during the period, 1935 to 1942.

Our Jan/Feb. article notified readers that a further discussion would appear in the next issue of Innerface on a paper by C.W. Sheppard entitled The Evanescent Mesotron—also identified by Matthew Block as one of the sources of Urantia Book statements. Sheppard's paper was published in Scientific American of October, 1940, and is about the structure of the nucleus of the atom.

The uncovering of these human sources is almost entirely due to the untiring and dedicated efforts of Matthew Block in a work that undoubtedly will prove to be of enormous value for the proper assessment and appreciation of The Urantia Book.

It is factual that the revelators clearly stated that they used in the order of three thousand human sources in constructing the text of the book. They also informed us that the terms of their mandate included "the proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge." (1109) Because of these restrictions, the revelators concluded that some of their statements, particularly those relating to the physical sciences and cosmology, would soon stand in need of revision. As well, the revelators said that, where considered essential, their mandate permitted them to provide key information that would fill  missing gaps in our knowledge or restore lost knowledge. (1109/1110)

Many readers, when first coming to The Urantia Book, have taken the word "revelation" to imply that the total text of this book falls into the category of divinely-revealed and hence infallible truth. Some have suggested that the discovery of even one error would disqualify the book as being revelatory. But longer exposure to the book, plus a careful and unbiased reading of the mandate and other statements made by the authors usually causes most such readers to modify this extreme view.

In its widest sense, the meaning of the word "revelation" is contained in the definition, "Any fact which gives knowledge is a revelation." The different meanings that individuals give to "revelation" is wide-ranging and subjective, with all individuals being their own "authority."

Nowhere do the revelators of The Urantia Book lay claim to divine authority or infallibility for their revelation. In fact, they reject their own infallibility by informing us that only the Creators possess it. (1768) And they do tell us that when truth is linked with fact, that both time and space condition its meanings and correlate its values, thus relegating such concepts to the domain of relative cosmic realities. (1297) "Truth is relative and expanding; it lives always in the present, achieving new expression in each generation of men." (888) There is nothing in The Urantia Book to support the thesis that its authors considered its text to be infallible. On the contrary, they recognize that truth is living, expanding, evolutionary and relative; it must never be permitted to become static—for static truth is dead truth. (1949)

Provided that we are sufficiently open minded to accept that the revelators were required to work within the framework of "the proscription of the impartation of unearned knowledge," then surely we must appreciate that The Urantia Book has given us a unique overview of the total creation that permits us to better comprehend its purpose, our role therein, even to attain an understanding of "free will" and the consequential sin, evil, and iniquity.  As such, it is the most valuable work currently available to the human race.

With all that in mind let's get on with examining Sheppard's evanescent mesotron paper and its contribution to The Urantia Book text. Readers need to be aware that the word "mesotron" was coined in the early 1930's to imply all particles of mass between the masses of the electron and the proton.

In his presentation of evidence that a particular work is among the sources used by the revelators, Matthew Block brings the text from the two works together in a two-column layout, the comparable sentences or paragraphs being placed adjacent to one another for ease of comparison. Viewed in this way, the degree of correspondence between the works is made evident. Eventually Matthew's work is to be published, hence in this article we will take a different approach and examine material that the revelators did not use, rather than comparing what they did use.

The third paragraph of Sheppard's paper states: "As most persons know, the atoms out of which matter is constructed are tiny 'solar systems.' Each has a central nucleus and a number of electrons revolving around it, like planets around the Sun."

The Urantia Book has: "Within the atom the electrons revolve about the central proton with about the same comparative room the planets have as they revolve about the sun in the space of the solar system." (477) [note: the term "central proton" instead of "central nucleus" is almost certainly a copying error as in the very next paragraph, the revelators speak of electrons revolving about the atomic nucleus.]
In its previous paragraph, The Urantia Book speaks of energy units (electrons) that revolve around a central body and "are faintly comparable to the planets encircling the sun."

In Sheppard's statement there is no trace of the planetary concept being only a "faintly comparable" one. Why have the revelators diverged from Sheppard's description which, being a 1940 review article from a reputable journal, should have been more up-to-date than W.F.G. Swann's The Architecture of the Universe (1934) which mentions the planetary model and is also a human source work for Paper 42?

I was actually surprised to read Sheppard's statement that "most persons know that atoms... are constructed like tiny "solar systems." In reality, the planetary model of the atom, having been introduced firstly by Rutherford in about 1911, and further elaborated by Bohr around 1913, was superseded by the mid-1920's. By then, electrons were no longer thought of as solid, planet-like particles, wave-particle duality having taken over. Today, this wave-particle duality is firmly entrenched, being supported by incontrovertible experimental evidence. Thus in saying that the atomic model is only faintly comparable to a solar system model, the revelators have shown "knowledgeable discriminatory selection" of what they would or would not use from Sheppard (who is supposed to be an expert in the field he is reviewing). This "knowledgeable discriminatory selection" by the revelators becomes more evident as we get further into the paper.

Sheppard's main topic was the role of the mesotron (meson) in the Yukawa model for nuclear stability and also in beta radioactive decay of certain atoms, models that appear on p. 479 of The Urantia Book. Previous commentary on this material is in "Science, Anthropology, and Archaeology in The Urantia Book" and in Innerface vol. 4 (1), available from the addresses on our front page. Again we will leave it to Matthew to point out the similarities while we note some of the differences.

The Urantia Book describes beta radioactive decay as follows: "The presence and function of the mesotron also explains another atomic riddle. When atoms perform radioactively, they emit far more energy than would be expected. This excess of radiation is derived from the breaking up of the mesotron "energy carrier," which thereby becomes a mere electron. The mesotronic disintegration is also accompanied by the emission of certain small uncharged particles."

Sheppards description of this phenomenon is: "There are certain radio-active substances...which eject electrons....It is known that, when a nucleus shoots such a particle out, a certain definite amount of energy is let loose. Unfortunately, however, if one examines the electron after it is emitted, one finds that it usually doesn't have the correct amount of energy, but a good deal less. Scientists therefore have been forced to say that the missing part of the energy has been carried away by a phantom particle which has no charge and practically no mass...This particle has been named the neutrino but it has never actually been detected." (Note: The neutrino is what The Urantia Book terms "certain small uncharged particles." At this point, ask yourself if you were a physicist faking a revelation would you really think it valid to infer that these particles were real when all attempts to demonstrate them since they were first proposed in 1932 had failed.)

Sheppard continues: "We have said that the nucleus consists of protons, neutrons, and carrier mesotrons alone. If this is true, where do the ejected electron and neutrino come from? The suggestion soon was made that the mesotron is not a stable particle but that it disintegrates into an electron and a neutrino....Calculations showed that on this assumption the mesotron could last only a few millionths of a second before this decay process occurred."

Note that there is no mention in The Urantia Book about any rapid decay of the mesotron of beta radioactive decay. Writing in 1992, Nobel prize winning physicist, Steven Weinberg, tells us that this mesotron-mediated radioactive decay is actually a relatively slow process that takes place in about one hundredth of a second.

Sheppard's discussion of the rapidity of mesotron disruption in radioactive decay takes up about one third of his paper. So have the revelators again shown "knowledgeable discriminatory selection" in choosing not to mention this rapid decay claimed by Sheppard?

Sheppard makes no mention of the time taken for the exchange process in which the mesotron functions as charge-carrier between the proton and the neutron of the nucleus. The Urantia Book does so: "The mesotron causes the electric charge of the nuclear particles to be incessantly tossed back and forth between protons and neutrons. At one infinitesimal part of a second a given nuclear particle is a charged proton and the next an uncharged neutron. And these alternations of energy status are so unbelievably rapid that the electric charge is deprived of all opportunity to function as a disruptive influence." (479) Weinberg confirms that these alternations take place in a million million million millionth of a second. Were the revelators again showing "knowledgeable discriminatory selection?"

As a point of interest, Yukawa's "mesotron," the one described in The Urantia Book as 	
contributing to the binding of neutrons and protons of the atomic nucleus was not actually detected until 1947, while the existence of the neutrino was not confirmed until 1956. The so-called mesotron of beta radioactive decay eventually became known as the W- particle and was not detected until 1981. Thus the description of these subatomic processes on p. 479 of the book, even though partially taken from Sheppard's 1940 paper, still remain quite remarkable.
