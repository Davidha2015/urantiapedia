# Belief is Reasonable

"How unreasonable that you should not worship God because the limitations of human nature and the handicaps of your material creation make it impossible for you to see him. Between you and God there is a tremendous distance (physical space) to be traversed. There likewise exists a great gulf of spiritual differential which must be bridged; but notwithstanding all that physically and spiritually separates you from the Paradise personal presence of God, stop and ponder the solemn fact that God lives within you; he has in his own way already bridged the gulf. He has sent of himself, his spirit, to live in you and to toil with you as you pursue your eternal universe career.

"I find it easy and pleasant to worship one who is so great and at the same time so affectionately devoted to the uplifting ministry of his lowly creatures. I naturally love one who is so powerful in creation and in the control thereof, and yet who is so perfect in goodness and so faithful in the loving-kindness which constantly overshadows us. I think I would love God just as much if he were not so great and powerful, as long as he is so good and merciful. We all love the Father more because of his nature than in recognition of his amazing attributes.

"When I observe the Creator Sons and their subordinate administrators struggling so valiantly with the manifold difficulties of time inherent in the evolution of the universes of space, I discover that I bear these lesser rulers of the universes a great and profound affection. After all, I think we all, including the mortals of the realms, love the Universal Father and all other beings, divine or human, because we discern that these personalities truly love us. The experience of loving is very much a direct response to the experience of being loved. Knowing that God loves me, I should continue to love him supremely, even though he were divested of all his attributes of supremacy, ultimacy, and absoluteness.

"The Father's love follows us now and throughout the endless circle of the eternal ages. As you ponder the loving nature of God, there is only one reasonable and natural personality reaction thereto: You will increasingly love your Maker; you will yield to God an affection analogous to that given by a child to an earthly parent; for, as a father, a real father, a true father, loves his children, so the Universal Father loves and forever seeks the welfare of his created sons and daughters.

"But the love of God is an intelligent and farseeing parental affection. The divine love functions in unified association with divine wisdom and all other infinite characteristics of the perfect nature of the Universal Father. God is love, but love is not God. The greatest manifestation of the divine love for mortal beings is observed in the bestowal of the Thought Adjusters, but your greatest revelation of the Father's love is seen in the bestowal life of his Son Michael as he lived on earth the ideal spiritual life. It is the indwelling Adjuster who individualizes the love of God to each human soul." (39/40)

# Why is The Urantia Book's "Life of Jesus" so important?

"If the faith of the creature were perfect, he would assuredly know that when he had seen a Creator Son he had seen the Universal Father; in seeking for the Father, he would not ask nor expect to see other than the Son. Mortal man simply cannot see God until he achieves completed spirit transformation and actually attains Paradise.

"The natures of the Paradise Creator Sons do not encompass all the unqualified potentials of the  universal absoluteness of the infinite nature of the First Great Source and Center, but the Universal Father is in every way divinely present in the Creator Sons. The Father and his Sons are one. These Paradise Sons of the order of Michael are perfect personalities, even the pattern for all local universe personality from that of the Bright and Morning Star down to the lowest human creature of progressing animal evolution." (28)

"The nature of God can best be understood by the revelation of the Father which Michael of Nebadon unfolded in his manifold teachings and in his superb mortal life in the flesh. The divine nature can also be better understood by man if he regards himself as a child of God and looks up to the Paradise Creator as a true spiritual Father.

"The nature of God can be studied in a revelation of supreme ideas, the divine character can be envisaged as a portrayal of supernal ideals, but the most enlightening and spiritually edifying of all revelations of the divine nature is to be found in the comprehension of the religious life of Jesus of Nazareth." (33)

"The infinite and eternal Ruler of the universe of universes is power, form, energy, process, pattern, principle, presence, and idealized reality. But he is more; he is personal; he exercises a sovereign will, experiences self-consciousness of divinity, executes the mandates of a creative mind, pursues the satisfaction of the realization of an eternal purpose, and manifests a Father's love and affection for his universe children. And all these more personal traits of the Father can be better understood by observing them as they were revealed in the bestowal life of Michael, your Creator Son, while he was incarnated on Urantia." (53)

"In the study of the religious life of Jesus, view him positively. Think not so much of his sinlessness as of his righteousness, his loving service. Jesus upstepped the passive love disclosed in the Hebrew concept of the heavenly Father to the higher active and creature-loving affection of a God who is the Father of every individual, even of the wrongdoer." (68)

"Nevertheless, I tell you that the Father and I are one. He who has seen me has seen the Father. My Father is working with me in all these things, and he will never leave me alone in my mission, even as I will never forsake you when you presently go forth to proclaim this gospel throughout the world." (1750)

# Materialistic Determinism. Last Rites

Ken Glasziou

The combined philosophies of materialism and determinism have dominated thinking in the Western world for many centuries. Put simply, materialism claims that matter is all there is and determinism claims that all matter obeys cause-effect relationships. Logically there is no room for free will or purpose in such a philosophy thus promoting an automatic tendency to godlessness

Materialistic determinism has been accompanied by a dispute between philosophers and scientists on whether there are limits to what science can actually know. The dispute was crystallized by the challenge of French philosopher, Auguste Compte, who scoffed that there were things beyond the ability of science to know. Among these, he included a challenge for scientists to discover the composition of the stars, something inconceivable to him in the early 1800's, but something that was duly achieved by Kirchoff and Bunsen in 1861 who used the spectroscopic method pioneered by Joseph von Fraunhofer to identify and analyze the elements of the sun and subsequently, the stars.

The concepts that there are no limits to what science can know accompanied by the materialist-determinist outlook on the universe have persisted very strongly right up to present times. The ideas were succinctly put forward by Pierre Laplace in the early part of the 19th century. Laplacian determinism is the claim that given complete knowledge of the state of the universe and the laws of nature, every detail of the future must become predictable. This is a concept that permits no role for mankind's free will. We do what we do because we cannot do otherwise. It is the concept behind causation in behaviorism. Among its better known opponents were Rene Descartes who argued that since the separate existence of mind and body are conceivable; therefore it must be possible (ie. his famous "I think, therefore I am" statement).

The concept that science has no limits was fortified by mathematician, David Hilbert, who, having claimed that there is no such thing as an unsolvable problem, set out to show that all the theorems of mathematics could be proved from a handful of axioms. The importance of this proposal is because mathematics underpins all science, without  mathematics there can be no scientific laws.

Hilbert's proposal was demolished by one of the most significant discoveries of the 20th century, the theorem of Kurt Godell who, in 1930, showed that there are statements in arithmetic that cannot be proved. All of a sudden, the foundation of mathematics, and hence of all science, was found to be incomplete!

Put another way Godell's finding says that since our mathematics may contain inconsistencies, how  can we possibly know that the laws of science are either correct or complete. To make matters worse, mathematician Alan Turing proved that there were statements in arithmetic that could never be proved within a finite period of computing time. This applies whether machines or mathematicians are doing the computing.

How then can a determinism which is based upon the necessity of inviolate cause-effect relationships which, in turn, are mathematical and scientific, possibly be a valid concept if mathematics and science cannot be shown to be free from inconsistencies?

A further fatal blow to materialistic determinism was dealt by quantum physicist, Werner Heisenberg's proposal in 1927 that it is forever impossible to know the precise location and velocity of any particle in the Universe at one and the same instant of time. Heisenberg's principle can just as well be called the indeterminacy principle but despite its success at the quantum level, the adherents of determinism by-passed it by claiming it was not valid in the real world of macro-objects.

In the last ten to fifteen years experimental evidence has continued to accumulate in favor of quantum theory in many and varied rigorous tests. Recently the peculiarities in the behavior of sub-atomic particles have been shown to hold good at the level of the atom itself—even in experiments in which atoms maintain a state of superpositioning (such as when existing as both particle and wave simultaneously), and becoming determinate as one or the other only when an observer chooses to make an observation.

In very recent years, a further step has been made in the direction of connecting the atomic and sub-atomic worlds with the visible world in experiments with what have long been known as Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC's), now one of the "hottest" fields (or should I say "coldest") fields in physics. Predicted as a new form of matter by Einstein in 1925 on the basis of calculations made by Indian physicist, Satyendra Bose, gases composed of identical particles were expected to condense into a single quantum state of very low energy if cooled to a temperature within a fraction of a degree of absolute zero.

Physicists can now routinely cool a gas the atoms of which are held suspended in a cell by means of magnetic fields and weak laser beams to a temperature as low as 50 billionths of a degree above absolute zero. If things are done right, out from the gas comes Einstein's indescribable glob—as many as ten million atoms in a form of matter never known before.

Physicists are now racing to see what can be done with these BEC's. One remarkable result came from forming two BEC's separated by  barrier, then removing the barrier so that on approaching one another, their matter waves overlapped to form areas in which the waves reinforced one another or else cancelled one another out in just the same way as light behaves when light beams are made to combine to form interference patterns. Thus we now have to cope with the concept of matter waves that can combine and interfere with one another!

In this kind of experiment many millions of atoms come together in a single quantum state, so bringing us ever nearer an understanding of the overlapping region between the micro and the macro components of reality.

An experiment now on the drawing board is to split a BEC into a superposition of states in which one state rotates clockwise and the other counterclockwise. An analogy would be two correlated electrons one of which must have "up" spin if the other has "down" spin—but remaining superposed in both possible states until one is forced to take a definite configuration whereupon its twin must take the opposite state.

For the BEC in a superposition of states, each of the ghostly states is composed of millions of atoms. Physicists wonder whether there are unknown laws that would prevent such a state, or whether ordinary quantum theory will hold good. If there are such laws and the standard theory is undone, whatever takes its place will be just as weird and wonderful.

At the macro level, our world seems solid, predictable, reliable. But just below an invisible surface, its parts exist in a state of unbelievably bizarre complexity, punctuated by impermanence and spontaneity—for example, virtual particles flitting in and out of existence yet accounting for half of the momentum of the atomic nucleus; electrons that jump between energy levels of the atom without ever being anywhere in between; correlated particles that "communicate" instantaneously even if separated at infinity; or particles in a superposed state that need the mind of an observer to flush them into reality. And all in obedience to a time-tested uncertainty principle that divorces the present from the future. But now we have these strange new Bose-Einstein condensates that bring us the prospect of filling the comprehension gap that separates the small from the large!!

Indeed we are fortunate to live in these exciting times in which our world can have meaning, God has become both a possibility and a probability, and we can know for certain that we have the free will to make a mark on the future of our future.

# Spontaneity, Unpredictability, and The Urantia Book

The Urantia Book was given to the world at a time when the concepts of materialism and a determinate universe were at the peak of their influence. The accompanying godlessness that goes with materialism may have peaked by the third quarter of the century and is perhaps now in decline. But in the first half of our century, many of the really great minds, such as that of Albert Einstein for example, firmly believed in a determinate universe, basing that belief upon the immutability of operation of the universal laws of physics.

"God does not play dice with us," said Einstein—while realizing that such a philosophy also meant that even the worst among our criminals were not accountable for their actions on the grounds that they did what they did because they could not do otherwise. European philosophers in particular took this kind of thinking to the very limits, culminating in the conclusion that this godless, purposeless, universe is simply an absurd joke.

So did The Urantia Book go along with a determinate universe and a God who does not play dice, or did it plumb for free will, choice of action, and indeterminacy? Let's see what it has to say:

"The bestowal of creature personality confers relative liberation from slavish response to antecedent causation, and the personalities of all such moral beings, evolutionary or otherwise, are centered in the personality of the Universal Father. They are ever drawn towards his Paradise presence by that kinship of being which constitutes the vast and universal family circle and fraternal circuit of the eternal God. There is a kinship of divine spontaneity in all personality." (71)

"Paradise is the pattern of infinity; the God of Action is the activator of that pattern. Paradise is the material fulcrum of infinity; the agencies of the Third Source and Center are the levers of intelligence which motivate the material level and inject spontaneity into the mechanism of the physical creation." (101)

"The mind-gravity circuit is dependable; it emanates from the Third Person of Deity on Paradise, but not all the observable function of mind is predictable. Throughout all known creation there parallels this circuit of mind some little-understood presence whose function is not predictable. We believe that this unpredictability is partly attributable to the function of the Universal Absolute. What this function is, we do not know; what actuates it, we can only conjecture; concerning its relation to creatures, we can only speculate." (104)

"Certain phases of the unpredictability of finite mind may be due to the incompleteness of the Supreme Being, and there is a vast zone of activities wherein the Conjoint Actor and the Universal Absolute may possibly be tangent. There is much about mind that is unknown, but of this we are sure: The Infinite Spirit is the perfect expression of the mind of the Creator to all creatures; the Supreme Being is the evolving expression of the minds of all creatures to their Creator." (104)

"We do not find the overcontrol of Supremacy to be wholly predictable. Furthermore, this unpredictability appears to be characterized by a certain developmental incompleteness, undoubtedly an earmark of the incompleteness of the Supreme and of the incompleteness of finite reaction to the Paradise Trinity." (115)

"In all your contemplation of universal phenomena, make certain that you take into consideration the interrelation of physical, intellectual, and spiritual energies, and that due allowance is made for the unexpected phenomena attendant upon their unification by personality and for the unpredictable phenomena resulting from the actions and reactions of experiential Deity and the Absolutes." (136)

"The universe is highly predictable only in the quantitative or gravity-measurement sense; even the primal physical forces are not responsive to linear gravity, nor are the higher mind meanings and true spirit values of ultimate universe realities. Qualitatively, the universe is not highly predictable as regards new associations of forces, either physical, mindal, or spiritual, although many such combinations of energies or forces become partially predictable when subjected to critical observation. When matter, mind, and spirit are unified by creature personality, we are unable fully to predict the decisions of such a freewill being." (136)

"All phases of primordial force, nascent spirit, and other nonpersonal ultimates appear to react in accordance with certain relatively stable but unknown laws and are characterized by a latitude of performance and an elasticity of response which are often disconcerting when encountered in the phenomena of a circumscribed and isolated situation. What is the explanation of this unpredictable freedom of reaction disclosed by these emerging universe actualities? These unknown, unfathomable unpredictables—whether pertaining to the behavior of a primordial unit of force, the reaction of an unidentified level of mind, or the phenomenon of a vast preuniverse in the making in the domains of outer space—probably disclose the activities of the Ultimate and the presence-performances of the Absolutes, which antedate the function of all universe Creators." (136)

"The farther out we go, the more certainly we encounter those variational and unpredictable phenomena which are so unerringly characteristic of the unfathomable presence-performances of the Absolutes and the experiential Deities. And these phenomena must be indicative of some universal overcontrol of all things." (176)

"The power centers and controllers exert perfect control over only seven of the ten forms of energy contained in each basic universe current; those forms which are partly or wholly exempt from their control must represent the unpredictable realms of energy manifestation dominated by the Unqualified Absolute. If they exert an influence upon the primordial forces of this Absolute, we are not cognizant of such functions, though there is some slight evidence which would warrant the opinion that certain of the physical controllers are sometimes automatically reactive to certain impulses of the Universal Absolute. (324)

"The interelectronic space of an atom is not empty. Throughout an atom this interelectronic space is activated by wavelike manifestations which are perfectly synchronized with electronic velocity and ultimatonic revolutions. This force is not wholly dominated by your recognized laws of positive and negative attraction; its behavior is therefore sometimes unpredictable. This unnamed influence seems to be a space-force reaction of the Unqualified Absolute." (478)

"Since mind co-ordinates the universe, fixity of mechanisms is nonexistent. The phenomenon of progressive evolution associated with cosmic self-maintenance is universal. The evolutionary capacity of the universe is inexhaustible in the infinity of spontaneity. Progress towards harmonious unity, a growing experiential synthesis superimposed on an ever-increasing complexity of relationships, could be effected only by a purposive and dominant mind." (482)

"The fact of the absolute mechanism of Paradise at the center of the universe of universes, in the presence of the unqualified volition of the Second Source and Center, makes forever certain that determiners are not the exclusive law of the cosmos. Materialism is there, but it is not exclusive; mechanism is there, but it is not unqualified; determinism is there, but it is not alone." (2077)

"The finite universe of matter would eventually become uniform and deterministic but for the combined presence of mind and spirit. The influence of the cosmic mind constantly injects spontaneity into even the material worlds." (2078)

Our quotes from The Urantia Book are quite conclusive about the pivotal roles of spontaneity and unpredictability in the finite universes. The sources may be Deity, Experiential Deity, the Absolutes, down to created beings including us humans—a necessity if we are to be endowed with the capacity to think and choose for ourselves.

# The Dawn of Creative Imagination. The Alter Ego

Author: **Ann Bendall**

One of the most wonderful times of childhood is the "imaginary friend" period, which seems to develop at about the age of three or four. If honored by the child in being allowed to view its world, the imaginary friend or friends are discovered to have names and personalities, and are well known to the child. The role of these friends appears to fluctuate between being a wise counsel, or being the object of a developing moral conscience. Consequently the friend is a wise sage or a naughty child, with the persona either taking advice from or berating the "friend" for transgressions.

And it is, "With the dawn of creative imagination (that) they (the children) evince  a tendency to converse with imaginary companions. In this way a budding ego seeks to hold communion with a fictitious alter ego. By this technique the child early learns to convert his monologue conversations into pseudo dialogues in which this alter ego makes replies to his verbal thinking and wish expression. Very much of an adult's thinking is mentally carried on in conversational form." (996)

As I read The Urantia Book, it appears that this ability to form an "alter ego" is critical to the development of all that distinguishes human from animal, i.e., the ability to utilize the mind adjutants of worship and wisdom. Further, in accord with my current interpretation of pp. 996-999, the evolution of civilization and religion is actually gauged by the evolution of this alter ego.

And we are encouraged to use our alter ego, with the revelators affirming that although: "It is altogether fitting that man, when he prays, should strive to grasp the concept of the Universal Father on Paradise; but the more effective technique for most practical purposes will be to revert to the concept of this near-by alter ego, just as the primitive mind was wont to do, and then to recognize that the idea of the alter ego has evolved from a mere fiction to the truth of God's indwelling mortal man in the factual presence of the Adjuster so that man can talk face to face, as it were, with a real genuine divine alter ego that indwells him and is the very presence and essence of the living God, the Universal Father." (997)

Jesus was a perfectly unified and well balanced personality, and he had unbroken communication with his Thought Adjuster. To my mind, he only achieved this through his developing, in early childhood, a preference for talking to his Father as his method of praying, and by sophisticating this technique throughout the rest of his life. I base this belief on the benefits elaborated as being ours in praying in this manner, i.e., "the result of all such praying is the enhancement of human character and the profound unification of human personality." (998) "Prayer, even as a purely human practice, a dialogue with one's alter ego, constitutes a technique of the most efficient approach to the realization of those reserve powers of human nature which are stored in the unconscious realms of the human mind. Prayer is a sound psychological practice, aside from its religious implications and its spiritual significance. It is a fact of human experience that most persons, if sufficiently hard pressed, will pray in some way to some source of help." (999)

The ability to live as if in the presence of God is through the "alter ego." And it is by utilizing creative imagination and faith in my convictions, that I am enabled to come in contact with my reality in the universe, my Thought Adjuster.

# Creative Imagination

Author: **Ann Bendall**

After the last reading of The Urantia Book, this New Year's resolution continued to be that this was definitely the year that I was going to conscientiously and concertedly try and follow one of the two final suggestions of the Revelatory Commission—to meet the challenge...to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind." (2097)

After many years of inconsistent attempts to meet this challenge, I decided that a strategy was essential. I know that if I could crack the code of the Blue Book (which masquerades as being in the English language), the technique would be contained within its contents.

So my 1998's theory was devised, based on the following (and I suspected, incorrect ) premise:  What I needed was "creative imagination." In their personality profile of the apostles, the revelators deemed John as being "gifted with a remarkable and creative imagination." (1554) But Philip "lacked imagination." This lack of imagination was the great weakness of his character....He was almost entirely lacking in certain types of imagination." (1556)

As I read the Blue Book in the sublimest of ignorant confidence (and armed with the curse of a computer), I discovered that the latter concept about imagination was one of their non-defined codes, that there really are "certain types of imagination." Accordingly I interpreted "creative imagination" as akin to "creative imagery" or "daydreaming," as when we mentally re-capture a scene of beauty. By this definition, an example of "creative imagination" was the strategy used by Jesus to cope with overwhelming emotional pain—he brought to mind old memories of scenes such as Mount Hermon and the beautiful sunrises and sunsets on the shimmering Sea of Galilee. (1969)

An anti-example of creative imagination (i.e., destructive of truth) I deemed as being exemplified by the "chief priests and elders," who made the decision to capture Jesus and have him put to death despite the fact that they knew he had raised Lazareth from the dead. Sure they alleged (believed?) that it was by the power of the Devil,  but it never entered their heads that if a person could raise another from the dead, irrespective of by whose power, surely that person could not be captured against their will, let alone be put to death.

Proceeding along this path of rationale, I deduced that if I could strive to still my mind by focusing in on a scene of nature then, even though it is highly unlikely that I have a "Supreme and self-acting Adjuster," I felt that I could still help my Thought Adjuster thus enabling it "to contribute factors of spiritual import to the human mind when it flows freely in the liberated but controlled channels of creative imagination"—with the joyous outcome as elaborated on p. 1199 (assuming that my Thought Adjuster can sieve through  my "preconceived opinions, settled ideas, and long-standing prejudices." (1199)

Unfortunately my hypothesis was being undermined by a growing suspicion that this "creative imagination" is not just me but me and my Thought Adjuster! This revision of budding theory stemmed from Ganid's proposal to Jesus, "Let's make a new religion" for "that which the lad wanted most he was unconsciously doing. And it was, and is, ever thus.... That which the enlightened and reflective human imagination of spiritual teaching and leading wholeheartedly and unselfishly wants to do and be, becomes measurably creative in accordance with the degree of mortal dedication to the divine doing of the Father's will. When man goes in partnership with God, great things may, and do, happen." (1467)

And so where I had wished to devise a nice, simple formula of "creative imagining," a sort of five minute daily exercise routine, in dismay I discover that this "better communication" is a process inspired by faith and is a philosophy of life consisting in:

1. "sincerely basing the human life on the highest consciousness of truth, beauty, and goodness, and then coordinating these qualities of divinity through wisdom, worship, faith, and love.

2. "loving God and desiring to be like him—genuine recognition of the divine fatherhood and loving worship of the heavenly parent.

3. "Loving man and sincerely desiring to serve him—wholehearted recognition of the brotherhood of man coupled with an intelligent and wise affection for each of your mortal fellows.

4. "Joyful acceptance of cosmic citizenship—honest recognition of your progressive obligations to the Supreme Being, awareness of the interdependence of evolutionary man and evolving Deity. This is the birth of cosmic morality and the dawning of realization of universal duty." (1206)

And where does "creative imagination" fit into all of this? My 1998 revised theory is that "creative imagination" is living each moment with a full conscious awareness of being in the presence of God, with his being subjected to my every thought and feeling. Oh for the days of spiritual babyhood when the chant "not my will but yours" was all that was required.

I so long to be the truth. "But truth can never become man's possession without the exercise of faith. This is true because man's thoughts, wisdom, ethics, and ideals will never rise higher than his faith, his sublime hope. All such true faith is predicated on profound reflection, sincere self-criticism and uncompromising moral consciousness. Faith is the inspiration of the spiritized creative imagination." (1459)

# What Constitutes  "Spiritual Experience?"

"the spiritual experience (having realized God) demands that man find him and sincerely strive to be like him." (68)

"realize" = to conceive as real.

"realized God" = conceived God as real.

"find him" = find him within ourselves.

"be like him" = Jesus' life revealed God's nature.

"be like God" = be like Jesus.

The Urantia Papers on "spiritual experience."

"The entire experience of Adjuster communion is one involving moral status, mental motivation, and spiritual experience." (60)

"Consciousness of divinity is a progressive spiritual experience." (140)

"Spirit-faith (worship) is the religion of the reality of spiritual experience." (192)

"While religion is exclusively a personal spiritual experience—knowing God as a Father—the corollary of this experience—knowing man as a brother—entails the adjustment of self to other selves." (1090)

"Spiritual experience reveals to the individual the true values of life." (1098)

"In the spiritual experience of all personalities, always is it true that the real is the good and the good is the real." (1122)

"The kingdom of heaven is a spiritual experience having to do with the enthronement of God in the hearts of men." (1535)

"Religion (true) is the exclusively spiritual experience of the evolving immortal soul of the God-knowing man." (1759)

"God who is spirit can be known only as a spiritual experience." (1857)

The unity of truth, beauty and goodness can only be realized in the spiritual experience of the God-knowing personality." (2095)

So realizing God, being conscious of divinity; communing with our Thought Adjuster; worshiping God; knowing God as Father; enthroning God in our hearts; experiencing "good;" realizing the unity of truth, beauty, and goodness;—these are all examples of what is meant by a spiritual experience.

Perhaps also, it is whenever a worldly experience brings forth a "thank you, God" that is untainted by selfishness, and is both sincere and heartfelt, then that experience qualifies for consideration by our Thought Adjuster to being spiritualized, and hence become an integral part of our growing soul.

# The Magic of the Placebo.

A placebo is a pharmacologically inert substance administered blind (unknown to them) to a control group in a test procedure as a way of detecting the activity of substances or procedures purported to be effective in treating a particular illness.

Allegedly, the patient's belief in the effectiveness of a drug or treatment often either brings about a cure or improvement in itself—the placebo effect.

This fact creates a situation calling out for "philosophical" therapy.

There are conditions (such as warts for example) where there is no known treatment that is effective— unless the patient has faith in the effectiveness of the treatment.

How can someone who has this faith actually be cured of what is known to be a real physical disorder, and not just something that is in the mind of that patient (warts are associated with infection by an identified virus)?

Suppose that I am a warty skeptic who is realist enough to realize that if I firmly believe my warts will go away as a result of a treatment, then they actually will.

How can I cultivate that belief without selling out on my critical soul? I am assured by the "experts" that I cannot avail myself of the cure except that I surrender to irrationality. So my dilemma becomes, "If I cure my warts I kill my rational soul."

Whoever said rationality had survival value?

# Paradigms for a New Religion: Unitarianism—a lesson in tolerance

Dick Bain, GA.,USA

Church talk is in the air. The Urantia community is cussing and discussing the possibility of a church1, a religion, or some sort of religious organization that incorporates the teachings of The Urantia Book. Just as human cloning is controversial in the larger community, so also is this issue divisive in the Urantia community. Regardless of the heat generated by the debate, this may be an idea whose time has arrived. If so, then it is an appropriate time to discuss the form that such a religion or religious organization might take.

There are many models to consider. Since most people in our culture are familiar with Christianity, it seems natural to look to it first as a model for a religious organization. But traditional Christianity is not the only model in our culture; there are those who march to the beat of a different drummer. Among these are the Friends or Quakers, Unity, and the Unitarian Universalists. Are there ideas of value to us among the forms and contents of religious organizations such as these?

My most recent experience with religious organizations is with Unitarian Universalism (UU-ism). While it is unlikely to be considered as a paradigm for a potential Urantia church, UU-ism does have features worth considering. And the Unitarian Universalists (UU's) have struggled with many of the problems with which a Urantia church would also have to grapple. What can we learn from their triumphs and failures?

History

The oldest Unitarian church in existence today was founded in Transylvania about 1560 CE. The movement was founded by those who did not agree with the Trinity concept that the orthodox Christian church insisted they must accept. Several of the early Unitarians lost their lives for such heresy. Michael Servetus was burned at the stake for his ideas regarding the Trinity and baptism. Francis David, the founder of the Transylvanian Unitarian Church, died in prison for his heresy after the death of his sponsor King Sigismund. Unitarianism developed as a formal movement in England about 1700 thanks to the efforts of the scientist, Joseph Priestley, who is best known for discovering oxygen.

Unitarianism in the US dates from about 1805. The more liberal element of US Unitarianism, closely associated with Transcendentalism, dates from 1838 when Ralph Waldo Emerson challenged the conservatism of the Unitarianism of his day. The American Unitarian Association dates from 1825. The Universalist Church of America was established in the US in 1793.

The Universalists differentiated themselves from traditional Christianity by proclaiming that salvation is universally available to all people, not just those saved or a small elect. In 1961, the Unitarians and the Universalists merged to form the Unitarian Univ-ersalist Association which has headquarters in Boston.

The Unitarian Universalist (UU) churches are of the congregational form in the US, and thus have complete autonomy from the national organization in Boston. The congregational form of church government is the only logical choice, given the UU's emphasis on the democratic process within organizations. A Urantia church would undoubtedly embody a similar democratic form.

Theology

UU-ism is probably known more for what it rejects rather than what it accepts. The majority of UU's do not accept the doctrines of the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, the Atonement, and Original sin. Additionally, many UU's do not accept the idea of a heaven or hell, but there seems to be a sizable minority who believe in some form of reincarnation.

While UU-ism does not have an official theology, there are a few spiritual concepts that many UU's accept. One is the idea that we all have a spiritual presence of God, the Infinite Mind, or some equivalent within us. This means that we can go within ourselves to find our spiritual resources rather than relying on some ecclesiastical authority. The closest thing to a theology in UU-ism is a statement of principles upon which UU's have achieved consensus2. But while there is not a definitive UU theology, there is a strong social gospel.

The Social Gospel

The emphasis of much of UU teaching and preaching is on improving life on this world rather than hoping for a better place in the afterlife. They have translated this philosophy into action by forming an outreach organization, the UU Service Committee, that participates in service activities around the world.  Many UU's are also strong supporters of groups such as Amnesty International and similar organizations that try to obtain justice for political prisoners and other prisoners of conscience. In addition, many UU congregations have a Social Justice Committee that works in areas such as equal opportunity and sets up programs to help the powerless and abused find social justice in various parts of the world. They are strong advocates for the rights of women and minorities throughout the world.

Environmentalism is also an area of special interest to many UU's. Many are avid environmentalists, and strongly support organizations devoted to the preservation and protection of our environment. This concern for the earth is mirrored in one of the UU Statement of Principles2 which says that UU's "Respect the interdependent web of existence...."

I believe that the UU collective of congregations fulfills The Urantia Book projection that "Someday religionists will get together and actually effect co-operation on the basis of unity of ideals and purposes rather than attempting to do so on the basis of psychological opinions and theological beliefs. Goals rather than creeds should unify religionists." (1091)

Because of their lack of dogma and their openness, the UU congregations attract a wide variety of people.  I was not aware of just how diverse UU's are until I conducted a survey of our congregation during one of our summer services. This informal  survey revealed the following breakdown: Atheist, 15%; Agnostic 21%; Theist 10%; Christian 15%; Deist  7%; Other 19%; Pagan 13%.

It is only because tolerance is an important principle of UU-ism that such a diverse group of  people can function together in relative harmony. While this does allow harmony, it also means that proselytizing for a particular theological point of view is not well received. The minister or presenter at a UU Sunday service must take care to treat issues (especially theological concepts) in a balanced fashion, or at least admit that what is presented is only their understanding or belief about the issue.

Even though people in the Urantia community are connected by the teachings of The Urantia Book, this community nevertheless constitutes a very diverse group of people. Any Urantian religious organization will face some of the same issues  UU congregations face. Not everyone accepts all the teachings of The Urantia Book, so what will be the role of the book in any such religious organization? Will we welcome skeptics into our fellowship?

I think the authors of the book were trying to give us guidance about any religious organization when they wrote, "When a member of a social religious group has complied with the requirements of such a group, he should be encouraged to enjoy religious liberty in the full expression of his own personal interpretation of the truths of religious belief and the facts of religious experience. The security of a religious group depends on spiritual unity, not on theological uniformity. A religious group should be able to enjoy the liberty of freethinking without having to become 'freethinkers.' There is great hope for any church that worships the living God, validates the brotherhood of man, and dares to remove all creedal pressure from its members." (1135)

While many UU's do not "worship the living God," they certainly do validate the "brotherhood of man" and do not place any "creedal pressure" on members.

Ritual

UU congregations may use some of the traditional rituals, but they have also developed a few rituals that are appropriate to the character of UU congregations.  One ritual that I believe is unique to UU-ism in its embodiment is the time during the Sunday service for candles of concern or celebration. People of the congregation come forward to light candles and tell of either joyous events they wish to celebrate or concern about some problem in their family, in their community or in the world. This may be the closest thing to group prayer in which UU's participate. 

Other rituals are modifications of Christian ones.  For instance, instead of a bread and wine communion, a UU congregation may have a water- or bread-sharing communion which takes on a different meaning than the "body and blood" concepts of traditional Christianity.

The flower communion is a relatively new tradition. One form of this ritual consists of each person in the congregation taking a flower from a selection at the front of the church and, if possible, giving it to someone in the congregation who has touched his or her life. The flower ritual originated during W.W.II. It was inaugurated by a Unitarian minister (the founder of the Czechoslovakian Unitarian church) who wanted to modify the form and meaning of the traditional communion ceremony so that people of all faiths could partake of it.

Another ritual of UU services is a time for feedback during the Sunday morning service from the congregation about the subject presented by the speaker. This gives people a chance to voice either assenting or opposing points of view, and may motivate the speaker to defend or clarify his or her assertions. 

The holiday celebrations in many UU churches differ considerably from those in Christian churches.  In the case of Easter for example, since UU's don't generally believe in the doctrine of the Atonement and the resurrection of Jesus, the sermon topic may be related to the cycle of life that renews itself every spring and/or finding renewal within ourselves. A flower communion may be a part of this service. Other adaptations UU's use are changing the words of familiar Christian songs to make them more acceptable, excluding songs from their hymnals that are out of character with UU thought, or including non-traditional songs 	
that are in harmony with UU principles.

Symbols

UU's have developed a few unique symbols. The most distinctive symbol of UU-ism is the chalice. This symbol was devised to honor Jan Huss, a priest of Medieval times. He advocated having the Mass in the vernacular of the people and having the people drink the communion wine as well as the priests. He was burned at the stake for promoting these heretical ideas. The chalice symbol was used during W.W.II by the Unitarian Service Committee on their transport boats so they would not be fired upon as they attempted to get refugees—mostly children—out of war-torn Europe.
The UU churches in Czechoslovakia have the sunflower as one of their symbols. The Transylvania Unitarian seal is the dove encircled by a serpent. This is derived from Jesus instruction to his apostles quoted in Matthew to, "be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves." The authors of The Urantia Book instruct us that:

"Regardless of the drawbacks and handicaps, every new revelation of truth has given rise to a new cult, and even the restatement of the religion of Jesus must develop a new and appropriate symbolism. Modern man must find some adequate symbolism for his new and expanding ideas, ideals, and loyalties. This enhanced symbol must arise out of religious living, spiritual experience." (966)

Identity

One of the problems a small liberal religious community such as the UU's has is identity. Because the number of UU's is small, and UU-ism has no universally accepted theology, many non-UU's do not understand what it is. Even UU's have a difficult time explaining it.  Many UU's reject the Christian label, yet there are a few Christian UU churches. To compound the problem, UU-ism in the US is constantly evolving. How can you capture the essence of something that keeps changing?

Another thing that contributes to the change is the influx of new members who come from traditional Christian backgrounds.  They may have given up their allegiance to their previous church, but they haven't necessarily given up all their old beliefs. It is not surprising therefore that a class called "Building Your Own Theology" is held periodically at UU congregations.

The clue to the survival of UU-ism is its emphasis on tolerance. Each person is in charge of his or her own belief system. In a way, it gives great freedom, because each person knows that proselytizing is unacceptable, and therefore members are free from pressure to accept other's beliefs.

Since UU identity doesn't come from its spiritual teachings, what is unique about the church? Its identity comes from its involvement in social issues, and their outreach programs. The UU emphasis on outreach stems from their convictions that we are in relationship to others, strangers, family, and the earth itself, and thus one's faith does not exist in a vacuum. But some UU's are not totally satisfied with this identity.

There are many UU's who feel that the church needs to have a more spiritual orientation. The problem is that UU's do not agree on what is meant by the term "spiritual." UU's also struggle with their feelings toward Jesus. Some have a great reverence for him; others discount him as another false messiah.  How can a minister address such issues where there are such divergent views? The ministers I have known try to present all sides of the picture and honor all points of view, while making their own points of view known.

Another way the diversities can be handled is by forming special interest groups within a congregation. A group of UU Christians may get together and have a Bible discussion group. A group of Pagans might get together for a Solstice celebration, or conduct a Solstice celebration as a Sunday morning service at that time of year. While these diverse groups don't always achieve harmony, nevertheless, it is a testament to the tolerance of UU's that there is as little conflict as there is.

Undoubtedly, the issue of identity will not be as difficult an issue for a Urantia church as it is for a UU congregation. A Urantia church doesn't have to be all things to all people, but it will nevertheless have to evolve a unique identity. A major question is whether such a church will be seen as an entirely new church/religion or just another sect within Christianity.  Because some of the theology of The Urantia Book is similar to Christian theology, it will be difficult to avoid the Christian label. Can we? Should we? We may think that these are questions that we will not have to answer for decades, but the time may be shorter than we think.

I have read that there already two Urantia churches in California who are beginning to address these questions. If the church movement swells and begins to grow rapidly, we will have to address many of these questions quite soon. There are a few lessons that we can learn from history. One of these is that the Christian church did not spring suddenly from nowhere. It built on the foundation of Judaism, Zoroastrianism, and other traditions.

While we should and certainly shall evolve our own symbolism, rituals, and even music, I believe that we will, at least initially, need to appropriate and adopt as needed, some things from Christianity and other sources such as UU-ism.

We could profit from taking the best from these sources and adapting it to our needs.  This has several advantages. First, the rituals and music will seem familiar to those of a Christian background—or whatever background we draw from—and they will be more comfortable with these things than something new and strange. Perhaps we should deliberately pull from some other traditions as well to give them a point of contact with the new church. But however the enterprise starts, I believe that eventually it must either establish a unique identity to differentiate it from Christianity, join forces with Christianity, or divide into various factions.

I believe we have much to learn from the worlds' religions and religious institutions. They have evolved psychologically satisfying symbols, rituals, and music over centuries and millenniums. I don't believe we should stoop to mere imitation, but we should profit from both the mistakes and hard won lessons of all these sources, and select and adapt the best of them to fit our needs.  Isaac Newton said that he stood on the shoulders of giants. I do not doubt we will be standing on the shoulders of spiritual giants as well.
