# The Fact of Experience

"Because of the presence in your minds of the Thought Adjuster, it is no more of a mystery for you to know the mind of God than for you to be sure of the consciousness of knowing any other mind, human or superhuman. Religion and social consciousness have this in common: They are predicated on the consciousness of other-mindness. The technique whereby you can accept another's idea as yours is the same whereby you may 'let the mind which was in Christ be also in you.'

"What is human experience? It is simply any interplay between an active and questioning self and any other active and external reality. The mass of experience is determined by depth of concept plus totality of recognition of the reality of the external. The motion of experience equals the force of expectant imagination plus the keenness of the sensory discovery of the external qualities of contacted reality. The fact of experience is found in self-consciousness plus other-existences—other-thingness, other-mindness, and other-spiritness.

"Man very early becomes conscious that he is not alone in the world or the universe. There develops a natural spontaneous self-consciousness of other-mindness in the environment of selfhood. Faith translates this natural experience into religion, the recognition of God as the reality—source, nature, and destiny—of other-mindness. But such a knowledge of God is ever and always a reality of personal experience. If God were not a personality, he could not become a living part of the real religious experience of a human personality.

"The element of error present in human religious experience is directly proportional to the content of materialism which contaminates the spiritual concept of the Universal Father. Man's prespirit progression in the universe consists in the experience of divesting himself of these erroneous ideas of the nature of God and of the reality of pure and true spirit. Deity is more than spirit but the spiritual approach is the only one possible to ascending man.

"Prayer is indeed a part of religious experience, but it has been wrongly emphasized by modern religions, much to the neglect of the more essential communion of worship. The reflective powers of the mind are deepened and broadened by worship. Prayer may enrich the life, but worship illuminates destiny.

“Revealed religion is the unifying element of human existence. Revelation unifies history, co-ordinates geology, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, and psychology. Spiritual experience is the real soul of man's cosmos.” (1123)

# Democratic Parenting: The Importance of Family and the Family-Council

Bob Slagle, Ph.D., Psychologist, CA, USA.

“The great hope of Urantia lies in the possibility of a new revelation of Jesus with a new and enlarged presentation of his saving message which would spiritually unite in loving service the numerous families of his present-day professed followers.” (2086)

The pre-eminence of family

In The Urantia Book the family concept portrays ideal relationships, even divine relationships, on the highest spiritual levels.  We are all members of one family, the family of God. The endorsement and acknowledgement of “family” in this epochal revelation nearly exhausts our human concepts of supremacy and importance.

“Almost everything of lasting value in civilization has its roots in the family.” (765)
“the family is the master civilizer.…” (913)
“...man's supreme evolutionary acquirement and civilization's only hope of survival.…” (943)
“The family was the first successful peace group ….” (765)
“The most effective of all social groups is the family.…” (1775)
“The family is man's greatest purely human achievement.…” (939)
“Family life is the progenitor of true morality....” (942)

And from Rodan of Alexandria,

“...family life is...worth any price, any sacrifice….” (1776)

The privilege of rearing cosmic citizens, children of eternal destiny, inspires us to persevere through the trials of family life.

“No surviving mortal, midwayer, or seraphim may ascend to Paradise, attain the Father, and be mustered into the Corps of the Finality without having passed through that sublime experience of achieving parental relationship to an evolving child of the worlds or some other experience analogous and equivalent thereto.  The relationship of child and parent is fundamental to the essential concept of the Universal Father and his universe children. Therefore does such an experience become indispensable to the experiential training of all ascenders.…” (516) Also, “...parental experience is essential, the idea of procreating cosmic citizens, the enlarged understanding of the privilege of procreation-giving sons to the Father.” (939)“The creation of new pictures out of old facts, the restatement of parental life in the lives of offspring-these are the artistic triumphs of  truth.” (555)

While the human family does not survive death, the earthly family may contribute to individual survival because of the values, habits, self-maintenance, and gratifications that are fostered in family life. A Primary Supernaphim, Uranita's Chief of Seraphim says, “Love of offspring is almost universal and is of distinct survival value….The animals love their children; man—civilized man—loves his children's children.” (940)

“Participation in family contributes mightily to social and personal progress. Couple marriage favors and nurtures intimate mutual understanding and effective co-operation which augments parental happiness, child wellbeing, and social efficiency.” (928)

The same primary supernaphim from Paradise characterizes the home as, “civilization's most useful and sublime institution…” (931) Later she says, “The family is vitally linked to the mechanism of self-maintenance;  it is the sole hope of race perpetuation under the mores of civilization, while at the same time it most effectively provides certain highly satisfactory forms of self-gratification.” (939)

The family is nearly all-important to the child. “The family represents to the young child all that he can first know of either human or divine relationships.  The child must derive his first impressions of the universe from the mother's care; he [or she] is wholly dependent on the earthly father for his first ideas of the heavenly Father.” (1922)

The importance of family life is certainly not unique to our planet. The people of a continental nation on a neighboring planet,  “...regard the home as the basic institution of their civilization. It is expected that the most valuable part of a child's education and character training will be secured from his parents and at home, and fathers devote almost as much attention to child culture as do mothers.” (811)

Michael's dedication to his earthly brothers and sisters of Joseph's family should inspire any parent.  Jesus served as father to his earthly family for almost a score of years. (1389) “The family occupied the very center of Jesus' philosophy of life-here and hereafter.  He based his teaching about God on the family, while he sought to correct the Jewish tendency to over honor ancestors. He exalted family life as the highest human duty.…” (1581)

Jesus' dedication to his family was constantly being manifested. “Jesus rightly reasoned that the watchcare of his earthly father's family must take precedence of all duties;  that the support of his family must become his first obligation.” (1389-1390)

He persisted, right up to his baptism, to contribute financially to the family and to take a deep personal interest in the spiritual welfare of every one of his siblings. (1419) And this demanding experience of supporting his family safeguarded against excess time for idle meditation or mystic indulgences. (1393)

Any commentary on spiritual family life should acknowledge the family's contribution to true brotherhood. “Marriage, with children and consequent family life, is stimulative of the highest potentials in human nature and simultaneously provides the ideal avenue for the expression of those quickened attributes of mortal personality. The family provides for the biologic perpetuation of the human species. The home is the natural arena wherein the ethics of blood brotherhood may be grasped by the growing children. The family is the fundamental unit of fraternity in which parents and children learn these lessons of patience, altruism, tolerance, and forbearance which are so essential to the realization of brotherhood among all men.” (941) So, the family is the essential arena for practicing love with one's own siblings. These fraternal feelings and attitudes may eventually be generalized to include all humankind, even an entire universe of intelligent life.

“Family life is the progenitor of true morality, the ancestor of the consciousness of loyalty to duty. The enforced associations of family life stabilize personality and stimulate its growth through the compulsion of necessitous adjustment to other and diverse personalities. But even more, a true family-a good family-reveals to the parental procreators the attitude of the Creator to his children, while at the same time such true parents portray to their children the first of a long series of ascending disclosures of the love of the Paradise parent of all universe children.” (942)

For ages, on our planet, children have been regarded as property. Enlightened parents must now learn to shift from the pride of ownership to the privilege of parenting, from thinking of one's offspring as possessions, my children, to contemplating the honor of temporary custody of God's children. The true goal of parenting is to gradually let go of our traditional parental role, with its often attendant selfishness, in favor of the brother-sisterly role, with its trend toward selflessness.

“Gradually” is the tricky word here. The wise parent strives to nourish the free-will dignity of each child at a developmentally appropriate rate, not so fast as to over burden the immature child with too much freedom, not so slow as to foster over dependency and stifle moral and creative growth. What a challenge!

It appears that all sentient beings in the master universe are bound to respect the free will of God's children, it's universe policy. This is instantiated clearly when we read of certain seraphim called Law Forcasters. “The intellectual foundation of justice is law, and in a local universe law originates in the legislative assemblies of the constellations. These deliberative bodies codify and formally promulgate the basic laws of Nebadon, laws designed to afford the greatest possible co-ordination of a whole constellation consistent with the fixed policy of non-infringement of the moral free will of personal creatures.” (432) Indeed, even the perfectly divine Thought Adjusters, “are always subservient to your will.” (1204 cf.,1183 1217)

What do these mandates imply for our human relations with each other, especially with our mates and children? If the absolute fragment of the Father refuses ever to encroach on the mortal free will of his host, even in the slightest way, what right do I have, in any degree, to violate the free will of one of my fellows? (1180) Yet, if one of my kind does not have a functional free will, I would think that this decree would not hold in exactly the same way. And just such a case is that of the young developing child whose free will is tenderly emerging. To me this is one of the powerful reasons why parenthood is such a monumental, even sacred, responsibility. How do we approach and accomplish this task of fully respecting the free will of our children while acting as responsible parents? Jesus shows us the way in his conduct toward his earthly siblings. It appears that his vital technique was the use of Family Meetings or Family-Council practices.

Why so vital? I am particularly impressed with Jesus' talk with John Mark that Wednesday the lad spent alone with God in the hills of Judea. Jesus made it perfectly clear that our early family life affects us greatly, not merely in this life and on the mansion worlds, but throughout all eternity. “A human being's entire after life is enormously influenced by what happens during the first few years of existence. (1922 ) The importance of family life to our world is emphasized in comments made by the midwayers: ”It is our sincere belief that the gospel of Jesus' teaching, founded as it is on the father-child relationship, can hardly enjoy a world-wide acceptance until such a time as the home life of the modern civilized peoples embraces more of love and more of wisdom." (1922) I am convinced that Family Meetings provide a sure way to augment both love and wisdom in the home.

I was, at first, taken aback by the style of Family Meetings Jesus practiced with his brothers and sisters. What surprised me most was the total absence of arbitrary or authoritarian punishment for any wrongdoing or infractions of family rules, not even by their father (Jesus). In fact, an offending youngster had to voluntarily agree to the consequence or punishment before it was enforced. (1494) When I first read this story I thought this an impossible situation. A child would surely filibuster or refuse to agree to punishment if he or she were not forced. Wouldn't you?

As the Family Meeting story unfolds it becomes clear that Jesus instituted a heavenly decision-making process.  And one that really works.

As father to his brothers and sisters after Joseph's death, Jesus used democratic Family Meetings, and in so doing, underscored a universal truth. “Justice is never a personal attitude; it is always a plural function.” (114) I believe that the ramifications of this statement for parenting and family governance are profound, far reaching, and challenging for any parent who truly wants to follow the teachings of our Creator Son.

Family Meetings (Family Council practices)

The Chief of Seraphim of our planet says, “Human society would be greatly improved if the civilized races would more generally return to the family-council practices of the Andites.” (941) Recall that the Andites were themselves superhuman, being the progeny of the Adamites and the Nodites. (871, 892)

What were the family-council practices of the Andites?  This Primary Supernaphim further qualifies the nature of these Family Meetings by saying, “They did not maintain the patriarchal or autocratic form of family government. They were very brotherly and associative, freely and frankly discussing every proposal and regulation of a family nature.” (941)

The book has little more to say on the way the Andites held their family-councils. I turned to Jesus to study the way he parented his own earthly family, for his divine mind surely knew (everything there is to know) about the family practices of the Andites.

In the section titled “The Nineteenth Year,” I find the most explicit directions regarding the essentials of Family Meetings. Jesus invariably used the positive method of exhortation. He refrained from emphasizing evil by forbidding it. Family Meeting and prayer time went together. Jesus used wise discipline early in his siblings' training. A watchword of the family was “fairness.” (1401, 1494) I have concluded that decisions relating to family matters were made unanimously, and that even punishment was agreed upon by all and even awaited the voluntary agreement of the offending person before being imposed. The story regarding little Jude is a poignant example. “On three occasions when it was deemed wise to punish Jude for self-confessed and deliberate violations of the family rules of conduct, his punishment was fixed by the unanimous decree of the older children and was assented to by Jude himself before it was inflicted.” From this passage, among others, I infer the importance of unanimous decisions, the consensual decision-making process in Family Meetings.

In my experience, the most important feature of Family Meetings is to make every decision by unanimous agreement. Many families which have tried majority rule, direct parental authority, and other techniques have found that consensus works best.  This means being patient and allowing for compromises and consensus building. Everyone, including each child, has equal and absolute veto power in Family Meeting decisions. It is okay to persuade family members toward a point of view but the taint of coercion should be avoided at all costs.  This is aimed to comply with the divine mandate that creature will is inviolate. I reiterate, even the highest of spirit essences, the divine Adjusters, subordinate themselves to the human will. “The Adjusters respect your sovereignty of personality…” (1204)

I encourage parents to wisely and patiently shepherd the agenda of Family Meetings to allow a child the voting power appropriate to his or her developmental level. It is important for parents not to “pull rank,” by arbitrarily negating a Family Meeting decision. Gradually, parents and children alike will come to rely on Family Meeting decisions and recognize the fairness and empowerment in the process. “Never should a righteous cause be promoted by force; spiritual victories can be won only by spiritual power.” (1765)

Models from on High

Why would something so seemingly simple and mundane as Family Meetings meet with such high celestial approval as to be used by the Lord of a Universe in this culminating bestowal? Consider the parallel between the consensual nature of Jesus' Family Meetings and the technique of adjudication on the highest superuniverse levels. Think about this:  Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia all end their careers with a supra-mortal Family Meeting. When a creature has made a final and a complete choice of unreality as his universe destiny, the extinction broadcast is not issued until there is unanimity among all three of the Ancients of Days. This form of consensual justice is all the more impressive when we consider that the Ancients of Days are the most powerful, perfect, divine, and mighty rulers in the time-space creations. (210) Yet, despite all this power and perfection of judgment, our Heavenly Father requires that no action be taken until the sinner himself approves of the justness of the verdict. (217, 615, 611) So this, too, is a kind of Family Meeting, albeit a cosmic and tragic one.

It looks to me like the Paradise Trinity reveals the loftiest version of Family Meetings. A Melchizedek of Nebadon states,  “The Master, when on earth, admonished his followers that justice is never a personal  act; it is always a group function. Neither do the Gods, as persons, administer justice. But they perform this very function as a collective whole, as the Paradise Trinity.” (1146) From this group Trinity function I infer a mighty admonition overhead when human parents seek to rule their children by personal authority in place of group decisions founded on family sovereignty.

How do the Gods of local universes make decisions?  You guessed it. They hold celestial Family Meetings;  “... there is an ideal of marriage on the spheres on high. On the capital of each local system the Material Sons and Daughters of God do portray the height of the ideals of the union of man and woman in the bonds of marriage and for the purpose of procreating and rearing offspring.” (930) “….both the Son and the Spirit function together, and in no creative act does the one do aught without the counsel and approval of the other.” (369) This embodies the consensual component of Family Meetings. As you may recall, at the jubilee of jubilees the Mother Spirit pledges to the Creator Son fidelity and obedience.  He, in turn, acknowledges eternal dependence on her and equality with her as co-ruler of their domains.  “And this becomes the transcendent pattern for the family organization and government of even the lowly creatures of the worlds of space. This is, in deed and in truth, the high ideal of the family.…”  (369)

So, it appears that from the lowest to the highest, from Earth to Salvington and on to Uversa and beyond, the Family Meeting idea is the fabric of universe governance and justice. No wonder we are directed to return to the family-council practices of the Andites. The heavenly model of family life encourages parents to unburden themselves of the pseudo-sovereignty of personal authority and release themselves into the joy and light of consensual agreements-family sovereignty—the Jesusonian approach to family harmony.

# The Power of an Idea

Author: **Ann Bendall**

I strive to know the truth in capital letters and accept that I never will. This “truth” excites me, as finality is a concept that I find almost terrifying as it would mean no more discovery, nothing more to learn. Is my idea true? To me it is for “the power of any idea lies,  not in its certainty or truth, but rather in the vividness of its human appeal.” (1005)

Vividness relates to the emotional realm, and the emotions have a world of their own. I imagine we have all experienced the confusion subsequent to an intensely vivid dream, that despite our rational analytic processes challenging our emotional reactions as “but it was only a dream,” in waking hours is still experienced as so real, that its memory is accompanied by cold shivers.

I have worked with emotionally insular men who have developed suppression of emotion to a fine art, and yet tears of terror will well in their eyes as they recount the “horror...but it was only a dream.” These dreams can be particularly disturbing if the person has symptoms of narcolepsy (sleep patterns at inappropriate times). Dreaming can then occur as the person is going off to sleep or is in the process of waking. In a state of conscious awareness, they describe a feeling of being “stuck” in the nightmare, and struggling desperately to wake so as to escape its “terror.”

As children develop, most appear to go through the night terrors or nightmare period where the focal symbol may be ghosts or witches or whatever image is portrayed in a horror film. Many go through a fear of the night, which is a fear of such dreams, and I wonder if each of us goes through the personal religious development period of our evolutionary forbears, i.e. through the ghosts, magical thinking, period.

I suspect so for, in times of crisis, I have seen intelligent individuals regress, embracing superstitious, irrational theories to strive to make sense of the nonsensical, to find cause in the “accident.” The underlying emotion is fear, fear in confronting the fact of their not being invincible, fear as “the beginning of wisdom.” And whilst the belief in their own immortality is held tenuously, often they will continue to believe in magic charms, reincarnation, etc., etc., as a way as a way of trying to regain some sense of control over their destiny.

A person in crisis has the myth of invincibility shot down in an instant. As corks in the ocean, an intolerably tenuous concept of their existence develops, and they cling to whatever, in an attempt to regain some sense of control and power. And alas, as so few of us are deep thinkers, normally “the power of an idea lies not in its reality or reasonableness but rather in its vividness and the universality of its ready and simple application.” (961)

What propensities do we humans possess leading to a bias in our ideology, assuming that we decide not to tap into Jesus' Spirit of Truth? Falling into the category of “unbelieving materialists and fatalists” such individuals “can hope to enjoy only two kinds of peace and soul comfort: Either they must be stoics, with steadfast resolution determined to face the inevitable and endure the worst; or they must be optimists, ever indulging that hope which springs eternal in the human breast, vainly longing for a peace which never really comes…. A certain amount of both stoicism and optimism are serviceable in living a life on earth, but neither has aught to do with the superb peace which the Son of God bestows upon his brethren in the flesh. The peace which Michael gives his children on earth is that very peace which filled his own soul when he himself lived the mortal life in the flesh and on this very world. The peace of Jesus is the joy and satisfaction of a God-knowing individual who has achieved the triumph of learning fully how to do the will of God while living the mortal life in the flesh.  The peace which Michael gives his children on Earth is that very peace which filled his own soul when he himself lived the mortal life in the flesh and on this very world. The peace of Jesus is the joy and satisfaction of a God-knowing individual who has achieved the triumph of learning fully how to do the will of God while living the mortal life in the flesh. The peace of Jesus' mind was founded on an absolute human faith in the actuality of the divine Father's wise and sympathetic overcare.” (1954)

The challenge to us is to believe as Jesus believed, being ever watchful to the power of an idea, born of our misconceptions and preconceptions, whilst acknowledging that, “It requires a great and noble character, having started out wrong, to turn about and go right. All to often one's own mind tends to justify continuance in the path of error once it is entered upon.” (1981) The Urantia Book abounds with examples of the power of an idea leading to actions far removed from being in the best interests of the individual or civilization. Jesus preached a simple message. He repeated and repeated this message to his apostles. During the week prior to his crucifixion his preaching turned to being an explicit demand that his apostles preach only that message, with his continuing to emphasize this in most of his appearances after his resurrection. But the power of the belief in the kingdom concept was too appealing to the minds of most of his apostles, and their love and relief that he was alive too great so they ignored his gospel by the power of the idea of theirs.

Last year I had the honor of observing the power of an idea to create reality, through a client who was referred for training in relaxation strategies prior to surgery. Fifteen years previously this lady had had 90% of her thyroid gland removed due to cancer. Additional growths had now been discovered, with surgery having to be aborted due to inability to complete the pre-operation procedure. The operation was scheduled for five days hence, and I felt confident that, due to this lady's personal belief in God, plus her stoical nature, that the two sessions proposed would be adequate. This confidence rapidly dissipated when I discovered the procedure involved.

Whilst conscious, her head was to be positioned so as to enable an almost straight line down through her trachea to her lungs, followed by insertion of three tubes up through her nose, the first with a camera, the second with a protective device for the voice box, and the third a tube which would provide oxygen to her lungs. It was estimated that the procedure would take approximately ninety minutes during which time she would be fully awake. This would be followed by a four operation under general anesthetic once the third tube was correctly positioned.

Realizing the power of her idea that I could help, plus my outward exuding of confidence that she was correct, she was taught abdominal breathing, muscle relaxation and then creative imagery consisting of angels soothing her throat, face, and mind whilst she was mentally far from the operating table at her self-chosen spot of a beautiful water hole in a rainforest. And, whilst her body would remain at the water hole, her mind would return to the operating theatre on a cue from the surgeon or anesthetist  which was to be her name, followed by an instruction which she would carry out before returning to the water hole.

The power of her idea and belief that she could achieve this state of rugged self discipline whilst at peace was affirmed five days later by her being given the “Award for Best Patient of the Year” by the theatre staff. I had potently prayed for her that day, and was relieved when the hospital advised that the operation had been successful, for I doubt whether I myself could have coped with such an ordeal. Which brings me to sharing my thoughts on fortifying my own courage and dedication.

On aiding my Thought Adjuster partner

I can aid my partner, my Thought Adjuster by:

Desiring to be God-like, and willing to do and be all things that are essential to the final attainment of the overmastering desire. (1205)
Trying to develop a modicum of “spiritual potential in my intellect.” (1203)
Devoted and determined effort to realize eternal destiny, which does not mean self-torture, mock piety, or hypocritical and ostentatious self-abasement, but loving service, decisions, determinations, and steadfast faith. (1205-6)
Becoming adept in the art of a continuous human temporal compromise whilst I yield spiritual allegiance to but one master. (1199)
If in doubt when making decisions, err in the direction of altruism as leading to the goal of human happiness and to the joys of the kingdom of heaven. (1131)
Learning to pray and worship like Jesus did, and to develop the strategies of problem solving that he himself used. (1774)

# Instructions from a Higher Authority

Ken Glasziou

“The religious challenge of this age is to those far-seeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness” (as found in a concentrated form in the text of The Urantia Book, see p. 43).

During his sojourn at Corinth, Jesus told a miller whom he met about “grinding the grains of truth in the mill of living experience so as to render the difficult things of divine life readily receivable by even the weak and feeble among one's fellow mortals.”

He also gave this instruction, “Give the milk of truth to those who are babes in spiritual perception. In your living and loving ministry serve spiritual food in attractive form and suited to the capacity of receptivity of each of your inquirers.”

Jesus instructions are about what to do rather than on how his word should be disseminated. He left that to the individual. He gave no instruction that his followers should seek to control the spreading of his word nor to dedicate their time and effort  to maintaining the integrity of his teaching. That task is impossible for mankind. The teaching of truth requires adaptation to need and circumstances. Aid in achieving a balance the function of the Spirit of Truth.

John Zebedee was the self-appointed disciple who undertook the responsibility of making sure that those without “official authorization” should be prevented from teaching Jesus' word. Referring to an unauthorized teacher, Jesus told John, “Forbid him not. Do you not perceive that this gospel of the kingdom shall presently be proclaimed in all the world. How can you expect that all who believe the gospel shall be subject to your direction?...In the generations to come many who are not wholly worthy will do many strange things in my name, but I will not forbid them.” (1704)

Is it not transparent to us that sharing his meal with a hungry beggar or speaking a comforting word to a leprous Samaritan would have earned John “praise in heaven” but that his self-appointed action was totally devoid of spiritual value and actually brought a personal and powerful reprimand from Jesus himself, one who is “as God” to the universe of his creation?

And is it not also transparent that this story of John's misdemeanor found its way into the Urantia Book for a very specific purpose not requiring the intellect of an Einstein to discern.

Both the text of The Urantia Book and the instructions of Jesus contained therein make it clear that our earthly task is not simply to read the book's text for our own selfish edification. Nor is it our task defend the integrity of that text. Our given task is in providing “the milk of truth” to those who are “babes in spiritual perception”—something probably in excess of ninety five percent of Urantia's population. And that work does have real spiritual value.

# Cosmic Reflections. The Visible Universe

by Dick Bain

In Paper 12 of The Urantia Book, “The Universe of Universes”, the author, a Perfecter of Wisdom, gives us some clues about the structure and size of our universe. At another place in the book, we are informed that such information may one day be outdated as we progress in our understanding of the universe. [1] Is this information now outdated, some 64 years after it was given to us? Have the discoveries of our astronomers discredited the size of the visible universe given in The Urantia Book?

The Urantia Book Universe

In order to compare the discoveries of our astronomers with the information in The Urantia Book, we first need to understand the picture the author of Paper 12 tries to paint for us. Figure 1 shows how the various parts of the master universe are layered. For simplicity, the two rings of dark bodies between Havona and the superuniverse level are not shown. The author tells us that Paradise is the stationary center of all reality and that it is very large, but the author doesn't say how large. Paradise is orbited by the seven circuits of one billion spheres of Havona, also known as the central universe of Havona. The next level is the grand universe, which consists of the seven superuniverses and Havona. Intervening between Havona and the superuniverse level are the two circuits of dark gravity bodies. No size is given for the central universe of Havona, but we are given one piece of information that allows us to get a rough size for a portion of it.

On page 153, the author of Paper 14 tells us that the inner circuit of Havona spheres requires 1000 years to complete one circuit or revolution around Paradise. We are also told that they travel at a high rate of speed.  We are not told how fast they travel, but we can calculate the maximum speed.  If the spheres are material, then they are limited to the speed of light. On page 134, the author says that the Havona spheres are material, but of a different order than the material of the superuniverses. Nevertheless, it appears that the spheres are gravity responsive. The dark gravity bodies help balance the gravitational forces between the central universe and the rest of the grand universe; this implies that the spheres of Havona are gravity responsive and therefore are likely subject to the same limitations on velocity as the material of the superuniverses. If this is the case, then the maximum speed or velocity the spheres can attain is the speed of light. The maximum circumference of the inner circuit of Havona spheres must be less than or equal to 1000 light years, and the maximum radius is therefore 159 light years. If the circuits of the Havona spheres were separated by one light year, then the maximum radius of the central universe would be about 165 light years. But there is one other piece of information that needs to be investigated to see if the circumference of the inner circuit of spheres is reasonable.

On page 152 we read that there are 35 million spheres in the inner circuit of Havona spheres. If the circumference of the inner ring is 1000 light years, then how much space exists between any two spheres?  We know that the spheres are much larger than any of our planets, but we aren't told how large. If we choose one million miles as the diameter of each sphere, then we calculate a distance between spheres of about 25 million miles. If the gravitational fields of these spheres are not excessive, this seems to be an adequate spacing for them. If a greater spacing is required for these spheres, then we would be forced to conclude either that they are moving at a velocity greater than the speed of light, or that they are significantly smaller in diameter than one million miles.  In any case, even if the central universe had a radius of a thousand light years, its size would have little impact on the volume of the first outer space level as we shall see.

Beyond the Central Universe

Encircling the superuniverse level is a 500,000 l.y. (light year) wide quiet zone that separates it from the first OSL. (129) The first of the outer space levels appears to be 50 million l.y. in thickness or cross sectional diameter (two times r in Figure 2.) This is based on the author's statement on page 129: “But about one-half million light-years beyond the periphery of the present grand universe we observe the beginnings of a zone of an unbelievable energy action which increases in volume and intensity for over twenty-five million light-years. These tremendous wheels of energizing forces are situated in the first outer space level, a continuous belt of cosmic activity encircling the whole of the known, organized, and inhabited creation.” The implication seems to be that the point of maximum activity is in the center of the level, so it appears that the total thickness is 50 million l.y.  But is the outer edge of the first OSL as far as the visible universe extends?

The Second Outer Space Level

On page 130, the author of Paper 12 has this to say about the second OSL: “Still greater activities are taking place beyond these regions, for the Uversa physicists have detected early evidence of force manifestations more than fifty million light-years beyond the outermost ranges of the phenomena in the first outer space level. These activities undoubtedly presage the organization of the material creations of the second outer space level of the master universe.” 

From this wording, it is unclear whether the “force manifestations” are visible or not, though the statement “presage the organization of the material creations” seems to indicate that material creations (galaxies) have yet to appear in the second OSL.  To further confuse matters however, on page 134 the author says, “It appears that the second outer universe of galaxies, like the seven superuniverses, revolves counterclockwise about Paradise.”  If indeed there are galaxies visible in the second OSL, then we need to know its size in order to determine the size of the visible universe.  Unfortunately, the authors do not give us this information, but there are some clues we can investigate to determine a figure. In one of his books [2], Bill Sadler Jr. came up with a thickness for the second OSL of 5000 million (5 billion) light years.  He did this by noting that the ratio of the first OSL to the superuniverse level is 100 and he assumed that that ratio held between the four OSL's. Is there anything in The Urantia Book that supports the idea that the levels increase in size?

The Increasing Size of the Space Levels

On page 351 of The Urantia Book, we are informed of the number of Master Architects of  the master universe that are assigned to the various segments of the master universe. Of interest to us is that 7 are assigned to the seven superuniverses, 70 to the first OSL, and 490 to the second OSL. It seems logical that more Architects are assigned to the second OSL than the first because the second OSL is larger. In fact, later on page 351 we are informed, “This, the final and largest corps, consists of 24,010 Master Architects, and if our former conjectures are valid, it must be related to the fourth and last of the ever-increasing-sized universes of outer space.” The author seems to be referring to the space levels as universes.  So, we can reasonably conclude that the second OSL is larger than the first one, and it may be as much as 100 times thicker, or 5 billion light years thick. Will the first OSL accommodate all the galaxies in the master universe, or is the volume of the second OSL required to contain this many galaxies?

The Volume of the First Outer Space Level

On page 125B, the author informs us: “In the not-distant future, new telescopes will reveal to the wondering gaze of Urantian astronomers no less than 375 million new galaxies in the remote stretches of outer space.” Of course that was 1935, and this is 1998, the era of the Hubbell telescope. A recent Hubbell deep space survey of the most distant galaxies revealed 1500 to 2000 in a very tiny patch of sky. On the basis of this measurement, some astronomers now estimate that there are over 50 billion galaxies in the universe [3], and there may be more that we have yet to see. Is the first OSL large enough to accommodate 50 billion galaxies?  To find out, we need to compute the volume of the first OSL. It seems to be in the shape of a torus (or doughnut), and the volume of a torus is:

V = 2p2 x R x r2, where r and R are the distances shown in Fig. 2.
r = 25 million l.y., and R = about 26.5 million l.y., assuming a 1.5 million l.y. radius from Paradise to the inner edge of the first OSL.

Using this formula, the volume of the first OSL is 316 quadrillion cubic l.y. (316 x 1021 l.y.). How much space exists between galaxies? According to The Urantia Book, our galactic system is about 500 light years in diameter. Astronomers calculate the size of the Milky Way galaxy at 100 light years diameter, but the whole system is several times larger if the companion galaxies are included. The closest galactic system to our Milky Way system is M31 at 2.2 million l.y. The next closest galactic systems are about 10 million l.y. distant. A cube of 5 million l.y. on a side seems to be a reasonable minimum volume of space for a typical galaxy. This is a volume of 125 million cubic l.y. This figure likely errs on the small side, since galaxies tend to occur in groups with significant space between the groups. In order to contain 50 billion galaxies with a volume of 125 million cubic l.y., a total volume of 6.25 quadrillion cubic l.y. (6.25 times 10 to the 15th power) is required. Therefore, the first OSL is about 50 million times larger than needed to contain 50 billion galaxies. Even if the average spacing between galaxies were 100 l.y., there would be more than adequate space for 50 billion galaxies. Thus we do not need to consider the second OSL; the first OSL will accommodate all the visible galaxies.

The Size of the Astronomer's Universe

Using red shift data, astronomers calculate that the most distant galaxies are between 10 and 15 billion light years from us. [4]  Our astronomers' universe is thus two to three times larger than the second OSL.  This difference is large, but nothing like the difference between 50 million light years for the first OSL and 10 to 15 billion light years for the universe.  This is a ratio of 2500. The authors of The Urantia Book explain that this discrepancy is due to the fact that much of the red shift we see is not due to the Doppler red shift where the color of the light is shifted due to effect but rather to the effect of space on light passing through it. There are a few contemporary astronomers, people such as Halton Arp, who have reached the same conclusion. If these few rebels turn out to be right, the result will be a revolutionary change in our picture of the universe, and a partial vindication of the cosmology in The Urantia Book.

Conclusions and Ruminations

The foregoing analyses are a rather speculative attempt to correlate what astronomers see through their telescopes with the cosmology of The Urantia Book.  The scientific and astronomical information the authors give us is generally vague and even seemingly contradictory at times.  It would be easy to write off the science and cosmology in the book as a hopeless morass of outdated information, but I am of the opinion that the authors have given hints about how the universe is rather than precise information.  Or perhaps they have provided concepts that are analogs of the features rather than exact pictures.  Apparently, their intention was that we would have to do a great deal of work to find what they are implying about the structure and nature of the universe.  I have read nothing outside the book to convince me that the universe is structured exactly as the book describes it, but nevertheless, astronomers are finding an amazing amount of structure in the universe as they study it.  The astronomers see bubbles, filaments, great walls and superclusters of galaxies.[4] Unfortunately, they do not yet agree on what structures are actual and which are just apparent. There are still too many pieces of the puzzle missing to decide what's going on out there.

This speculation about the size of the universe is a necessary step towards looking at the space respiration phenomenon (125) and attempting to correlate it with current astronomical findings, which I hope to do in a future article. I am hopeful that there are features of the universe like space respiration that are accurately described in The Urantia Book.  I will be very disappointed if there is no evidence supporting the space respiration concept in the results of our astronomers investigations. Nevertheless, I think that we owe it to the future generations of Urantia Book students to look at the validity of the various scientific concepts in the book and honestly assess which are supported by the evidence, and which are not. As Jesus said, “..the truth never suffers from honest examination.” (1711)

# More on Gardner' Goofs

Ken Glasziou

In detailing their account of  life and land evolution  on our planet in Urantia Papers 57, 58, 59 and 60, their authors have wholeheartedly embraced the concept of continental drift, an idea first touted by Alfred Wegener in 1910. Take away continental drift from these four Papers and they collapse as an irrational heap.

In a paper entitled “ The Science Content of The Urantia Book,1” myself and my co-authors drew attention to the fact that, over the period in which the Urantia papers were received and published (1934-1955), the concept of continental drift was held only tenuously and by very few geologists. Antipathy to the concept was stated to have been particularly strong in the USA. This antipathy lasted through from the early 1920's to well into the 1960 period.

In our view, if the Urantia Papers were fake revelation by human authors, it would have been quite strange for the postulated authors to go against the grain of prevailing professional opinion by making their story of life and land evolution so highly dependent upon the truth of the continental drift theory. In support of our view that opposition to the theory was extremely strong, we cited a recent book by science historian, H.E. Le Grand2, as well as earlier criticisms of Wegener's theory by eminent geologist, R.T. Chamberlin in which he listed 18 points that he considered were destructive of the hypothesis.

Gardner's critique (“Urantia: The Great Cult Mystery”) of our continental draft account is an example of what Meredith Sprunger described as “the irrelevant conclusion fallacy.3” Gardner finds publications by a few European and South African geologists who thought Wegener's ideas were worthy of consideration, rambles on about them, gives some details of various conferences and postulates, and then finishes with “The four Urantian authors also make much of two ancient supernova explosions.” 

How this critique is supposed to demolish the apparently prophetic nature of some of the science content of the book is hard to see. Gardner plays another of the tricks of his trade as a professional debunker by ignoring those items for which he has no explanation or by diverting attention through his citation of comparative irrelevancies.

For the continental drift story of the Urantia Papers, the major “prophetic” item was the actual starting date for drift, given as 750 million years ago. In contrast, Wegener had suggested 200-300 million years ago, a view that remained dominant until the 1980's when the commencing date was pushed back  to 500 million years or more, and with a recent estimate4 coinciding exactly with the 750 million years given in Paper 57.

[Note: Geological dating of this kind is by no means an exact science. The estimate of “750” probably means, “closer to 750 than to either 700 or 800 million.”]

A review of “plate tectonics,” the replacement name for “continental drift,” appears in the recent CDROM edition of Encyclopedia Britannica and states, “...disbelief (in Wegener's continental drift) was so strong that it often bordered on indignation. One of the strongest opponents was the British geophysicist Sir Harold Jeffreys, who spent years attempting to demonstrate that continental drift is impossible because the strength of the mantle should be far greater than any conceivable driving force….It was in North America, however, that opposition to Wegener's ideas was vigorous to the point of excess and very nearly unanimous….Wegener was attacked from virtually every possible vantage point, his paleontological evidence attributed to land bridges, the similarity of strata on both sides of the Atlantic called into question, the fit of Atlantic shores declared inaccurate, and his very competence doubted….”—and much more.

As with his critique of continental drift, so with Gardner's comments on supernova in which he takes advantage of the probable ignorance of his readers on this topic when he diverts attention from the critical points with irrelevant discussion.

The idea of large single stars collapsing to form a neutron star or a black hole was a supposition of astrophysicists with overly vivid imaginations until long after the Urantia Papers had been received and published. A good theoretical basis for the formation of a neutron star was not laid down until 1957. (Burbidge et al.5) However,  proof of their existence did not come until 1967.

Illustrating the lack of good evidence in favor of their existence, in 1960 distinguished Russian astro-physicist Igor Novikoff wrote, “Apparently no searches in earnest for neutron stars or black holes were attempted by astronomers before the 1960's. It was tacitly assumed these objects were far too eccentric….”

However, the Urantia Book (1955) authors were undaunted, writing: “In large suns when hydrogen is exhausted and gravity contraction ensues, and such a body is not sufficiently opaque to retain the internal pressure of support for the outer gas regions, then a sudden collapse occurs. The gravity-electric changes give origin to vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential, and such particles readily escape from the solar interior thus bringing about the collapse of a gigantic sun within a few days..” (464)
The “vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential” that escape readily from the solar interior are now identified with the neutrinos which were not actually demonstrated to exist until 1956. But even the 1957 paper from the Burbidges' group5 that laid the theoretical foundation for the understanding of neutron star collapse nevertheless failed to assign a role to the neutrinos in the explosive conduction of energy away from the core.

The number of people who, in 1955, would have had the faintest inkling of what the Urantia Paper authors meant by their statement that “such a body is not sufficiently opaque to retain the internal pressure of support” could have been counted on one hand. And even taking 1955 as cut-off date, for the Urantia Paper authors to uphold the already discredited suggestions of Gamow and co-workers that “tiny particles devoid of electric potential” were the means of collapsing the star really must be recognized as being either truly remarkable foresight or else it is attributable to pre-knowledge.

The “opaqueness” the authors refer to is such that even the uncharged and mass-less photons of light take around a million years to move from the center to the perimeter of stars like our sun. Only a very strange, unknown, virtually undetectable, and almost totally unreactive particle could have possibly acted as energy carrier in the kind of stellar explosion the Urantia Papers' authors describe.

The neutrino, a “tiny particle devoid of electric potential,” has now been confirmed to be that carrier, and to be responsible for transfer of more than 90% of the energy released in a supernova. Recall though, that the actual reality of neutrinos was not established until 1956, the year after the book's publication.

I, personally, find it impossible to believe that someone with Martin Gardner's reputation as a critic of advanced scientific concepts could be ignorant of the remarkable nature of these sections from The Urantia Book. Blind to them, yes, but not ignorant. His motives in failing to mention the detail of neutron star formation and items such as the commencing time of continental drift are known only to himself. Whatever else this reveals, it demonstrates that Gardner is no seeker after truth, at least not as that concept is used in the Urantia Papers' terminology.

The question I again put to readers is why would hypothetical human authors of these Urantia Papers have included materials that were so highly speculative from a human viewpoint? Surely anyone attempting to add “prophetic” science in support of a claim to revelation would have avoided  ideas that apparently had only a very slight chance of turning out to be correct.

Gardner's attitude to “prophetic” materials in the Urantia Papers is that if the authors made enough guesses they would be sure to get some things right. We have previously pointed out 1 that, when dealing with hypotheses that have a slight chance of being correct, the odds become multiplicative. If two guesses are made, each with a one in ten chance of being correct, then the chances of getting both correct are one in a hundred.

The number of remarkable “guesses” in the Urantia Papers that are now known to be correct is far too great to be attributable to pure chance, even if they had been made by professional scientists in their own field of study. Gardner is a mathematician and must be aware this is so.

The mandate given to the revelators of the Urantia Papers disallowed the revealing of unearned knowledge but allowed for reduction of confusion by the elimination of error and the co-ordination of about-to be-known facts.

We have no idea of why the revelators chose to provide information on continental drift, neutrinos, neutron stars, etc., in the way they have, but can be quite certain it was not their intention that this “prophetic” material should be taken either as proof of the existence of God or as confirmation of the revelatory status of the Urantia Papers.

Among much else they state, “The existence of God can never be proved by scientific experiment or by the pure reason of logical deduction.” (24)  They also inform us that, “Revelation is validated only by human experience.” (1106) But whatever the reasons for their mode of presentation may have been, the effect of their “prophetic” material upon the truth-seeker can only be transitory. Once faith in divine truth is established, the need for so-called “proof” diminishes to approach zero.
