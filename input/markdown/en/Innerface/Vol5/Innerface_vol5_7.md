# Are The Urantia Papers demonstrably of superhuman origin?

If we concede that hearsay evidence is inconclusive, then there is no concrete evidence that can unequivocally verify such a claim. However, there are at least two alternative means by which we can evaluate our ideas about the authorship of the Papers.

If we divide the subject matter of the Papers into a component containing theological and philosophical discussion having a “spiritual”  flavor, and a second component that covers historical, anthropological, and archaeological matters, then we give ourselves the opportunity to utilize comparative methods to  evaluate whether we believe various sections are within the creative capacity of known human authors.

If we believe they are, then we can still take from the Papers, whatever we find to be meaningful for ourselves. But if we do come across materials that we think are beyond or above the capacity or means of human authors, then we have a different but personal decision to make about meaning.

For any new reader, it may be far more productive to ignore all they may have seen or heard about the Papers and simply read them for their immediate intrinsic worth.

To pre-judge the Papers and bring previously held prejudices into the assessment can be counter productive. An example is Martin Gardner, author of a critique entitled “Urantia. The Great Cult Mystery.” Prior to writing his book, Gardner was author of a magazine article that denigrated The Urantia Book. However, he made so many errors that he later admitted that he had not actually read it. His subsequent book was mainly an exercise in self-justification.

# More about the Urantia Papers

In some ways it seems unfortunate that an alternative name for The Urantia Book is “The Fifth Epochal Revelation.” It is the effect of this acquired name that has caused so many readers to attribute a fundamentalist-style “absolute and infallible truth”  status to its content.

The authors themselves make no such claim. And nowhere do they use the term “the Fifth Epochal Revelation.” The closest comment is that among many events of religious revelation, “only five are of epochal significance.” Of these, the life and teaching of  Jesus could perhaps aspire to divine authority but, even for that, we have only records that, one way or another, have felt the touch of human hands.

The revelators have applied themselves with some diligence to the task of avoiding the problems that Christianity has faced through the imposition of a divine dictation theory to biblical writings. For example, they state, “The creature may crave infallibility but only the Creators possess it.”

None of the authors of the Urantia Papers have a claim to “Creator” status. Therefore none can be infallible, something they themselves freely acknowledge. In fact they leave no room for doubt as to what they believe about their own work. “Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired.” (1109)

While it is obviously true that many parts of this book are not of “inspired” status, there are also many  sections that have the ring of divine truth. But the proof of divine truth is entirely a personal experience.

“Reason is the proof of science, faith the proof of religion, logic the proof of philosophy, but revelation is validated only by human experience.” (1106)

Another important statement from the Papers is:

“The existence of God is utterly beyond all possibility of demonstration except for the contact between God-consciousness of the human mind and the God-presence...that indwells the mortal intellect and is bestowed upon man as the free gift of the Universal Father.” (24)

A stated purpose for the Urantia Papers is to “synthesize the apparently divergent sciences of  nature and the theology of religion into a consistent and logical universe philosophy.” (1106) This would be an impossible task if the authors were constrained by having to provide infallible truth and, at the same time, comply with a mandate that proscribed the impartation of unearned knowledge. And they even state their cosmology is “not inspired.” (1109)

When the Urantia Papers were received in the mid- 1930's, traditional cosmology dealt with features of creation as a whole. It could include speculative philosophy in its widest sense.1 In its current usage, the meaning of the term has narrowed  to astrophysics and astronomy. But it is used in the Urantia Papers in its  traditional sense, and covers every aspect of creation.

A little thought is all that is necessary to realize that a consistent philosophy, or cosmology, does not need to be infallible truth in order to be enormously beneficial. Philosophical and cosmological truth may often be more useful and more comprehensible if conveyed under the guise of myth, parable, or allegory.

Assessing truth

Some books that we read may stimulate an urge to read them again and again in order to gain their full benefit. I've always been amazed by how much my first assessment of any book declined on even the second reading. Only rarely have I undertaken a third full reading of any book.

There are a few exceptions. One came about through my acquisition of a Bible that had the spoken word of Jesus from the Gospels picked out in red print. I found I could read substantial amounts of both Matthew's and John's Gospels without ever tiring of them.

The other exception is certain Papers from The Urantia Book. I've been reading these on a daily basis for going on thirty years—and never expect to master what they contain, nor to tire of trying.

I feel that I am a highly critical kind of person. During my fifteen years as head of a research laboratory, I used to tell new graduates who came to work with us that their productivity would be hamstrung until they learned to question all they ever thought they knew.

I had tackled the Bible and The Urantia Book with this approach, and on the assumption that you don't discover truth—you feel it.

My science career was dominantly in the field of biochemistry. Theoretical physics and mathematics are fields where a feeling for truth is ultra important.  Truth has a smell all of its own. Mathematicians and physicists pluck truth out of the depths of their minds. Biochemists, though they may smell truth, have to work empirically—sift the data, make a hypothesis, do an experiment, improve the hypothesis, and so on and so on. It can be tedious stuff.

One of the truly great geniuses of our century was a  mathematician named Kurt Godel. He “proved” that there is no set of computational rules that can characterize the properties of natural numbers. Put another way, it means that our number system cannot be shown to be self-consistent. Surely then our implicit trust in numbers is because they have the smell of truth.

Roger Penrose, another maths-physics genius of this century used the following illustration2 that indicates mind is something very special. Draw on a blackboard a variety of objects in groups such as two cups, five pencils, three knives, etc., set any number of computers in front of the blackboard, and switch them on. You can leave them there for weeks, months, even years and they will be quite unable to devise the set of natural numbers from any set of rules programmed into them—and certainly not from their own intuition. But show the same set to small children and most will abstract the concept of natural numbers, even though they had no prior training in mathematics! 

It does not require genius class thinking to realize there is something very special about human minds. I'm quite sure that one of its specialties is the ability to intuitively feel truth. Of course it is possible to train and develop this gift. And the more accurate knowledge that we accumulate, the better equipped we ought to be to discern deeper and deeper truth.

We all have the gift for feeling truth—regardless of  higher education and intellectual ability. I think many animals may have it in some more primitive way. Did you know that bees can count?5

Truth discernment is the gift we must use to help us evaluate the Urantia Papers. Clearing our minds from preconceived prejudices can be a great help.

It is true that life's circumstances may have preconditioned some people to be gullible when they first find The Urantia Book. Having been told that the Papers have celestial authors, and given some vivid propaganda about their revelatory status—perhaps accompanied by a need to make sense of their lives—some may then be ready to believe something that they feel will help to solve their personal problems. Time often makes such people very much more discerning, particularly as they develop their feel for truth.

For lots of us, our introduction to the Papers comes about in the absence of any apparent psychological need for a lifesaving prop. Perhaps we were voracious consumers of written material, or we may simply have been seekers after truth. Or perhaps some random combination of circumstances may have caused us to start browsing through them.

Whatever it is that starts our quest, we are quickly confronted with the fact that there are more than two thousand pages in The Urantia Book, most of them requiring attentive concentration in order to comprehend their meaning. So perhaps some external help may assist in the quest for truth.

In illustration that prior knowledge can be a help for comprehension of the Urantia Papers, let me point out that the mandate under which their authors had to work is not discussed in any depth until just past the half way point in the book.  And the mandate was such as to ensure that the cosmology of the Papers would be quickly outdated.

It is easy to miss two important statements, one near the beginning, the other in the last third of the book, that inform us that human sources, about three thousand of them, have been used whenever these sources have described some concept or idea reasonably well.

Those who had to discover these points for themselves probably experienced much frustration in their journey of discovery. But my own experience has brought about a judgment that can be summarized in these terms: If these Papers are not true, then they ought to be true.

A very large number of Christians have, through the ages, arrived at concepts about God and about Jesus, his life and teachings, that are similar to those depicted in the Urantia Papers. But it usually takes a life-time of study and experience to reach that state. The Urantia Papers can greatly help anyone to simplify and shorten their journey. And that can occur regardless of any belief held about their authorship and revelatory status.

# Some Early history

The Urantia Papers got off to a bad start when first published as The Urantia Book in 1955. With the best of intentions, many of those responsible for its initial introduction did their utmost to impose it upon the world totally as a divinely authorized revelation.

Expectations of these early readers were not dissimilar to those of John the Baptist in his campaign as herald for the Messiah. They sent the book to kings, queens, popes, presidents, senators, congressmen. Many appear to have expected our world leaders to instantly embrace it as commands direct from God,  to drop to their knees in repentance, and to set about the immediate inauguration of the age of Light and Life.

The revelators gave us the Urantia Papers, not “The Urantia Book” nor its transformation to “The Fifth Epochal Revelation.” That was man's doing. One effect was to send orthodox Christianity to scurry for cover. I'm sure that was not intended by the revelators. In fact it appears to be one of their great hopes that Christianity would be persuaded to switch their primary teaching  away from Paul's Christology and to Jesus' revelation of the nature of God.

This is not really a criticism of Paul. The revelators indicate their full awareness of the essential role of Paul for the survival of any knowledge of a Jesus of Nazareth into modern times. Without Paul, the memory of Jesus would probably have disappeared from our records. The Papers tell of the disciple, Abner, who rigorously clung to Jesus' teaching with a no compromise attitude. Abner and his followers quickly disappeared from the pages of history.

Paul's Christology was the most advanced religion of general appeal to us humans, both in Paul's time and even up to the present. Paul virtually ignored the human Jesus in his writings (though not necessarily in his private devotions).

Paul's pragmatic Christology was founded  upon the basic human need for forgiveness of sin. Associated with that need, there is a human addiction to the concept of a necessity for appeasement and sacrifice. Thus we make God in our own image.

The practice of Christianity is still built around sin, guilt, and the sacrificial means of escape from punishment. The revelators indicate it may take as personified, and that all of us, of all races, nations,  and religions, are rightful members of the family of God.

Some readers who have yet to form an opinion about the validity of the Urantia Papers may turn to its science, archaeology, cosmology, etc., for help in their quest for truth.

Dr. Meredith Sprunger, a retired academic and minister of religion, has pointed out that the origin and authorship of a work such as the Urantia Papers is not a philosophical criterion of truth. The Papers themselves deny that science can validate religious truth.

“The existence of God can never be proved by scientific experiment or by the pure reason of logical deduction. God can be realized only in the realms of human experience.” (24)

And on page 1106:

“Reason is the proof of science, faith the proof of religion, logic the proof of philosophy, but revelation is validated only by human experience.”

Thus, according to the Urantia Papers, both the existence of God and the truth of revelation can be validated only through our own personal experience.

The Urantia Papers concentrate our attention upon the role played by the Father-Spirit that indwells us, and the aid provided by other spirit forces such as the Spirit of Truth as prime movers for assisting us in validating our truth experience. They are also referred to in the gospel of John as well as in Paul's letters to the Galatians and Romans,3

So can the science, anthropology, and archaeology of the Papers give any help in our quest to discover truth?

An important contribution they make is that they demonstrate that the Papers have not been thrown together haphazardly in some kind of save-the-world crusade. For example, the multitude of archaeological references in Part 4 indicate that a fastidious scholarship has gone into the writing of these Papers, work that would have required an enormous input of time and dedicated effort.

To date all attempts to locate scholars who could have actually contributed these and other specialist materials, including the debunking attempt made by professional skeptic, Martin Gardner, have failed to do so.

The Papers also reveal a quite extraordinary knowledge of text from both the Old and New Testaments. Thus, whoever was responsible for authorship had  hundreds upon hundreds of relevant quotes readily available, probably in their memory, in support of the many and varied concepts being discussed.  It is worth while to ponder upon these points as the Papers are read.

A careful examination of the way biblical quotes were used indicates that they could not simply have been pulled out from a concordance, nor could computerized data bases been used as they were not available up to the time of publication of the book.

The science content of the Papers is extensive and demonstrates a wide ranging knowledge of physics and the biological sciences, some being of the kind  normally held only by specialists in restricted fields.

The quality of some of the science component is supportive of my previous conjecture that these Urantia Papers are works of advanced scholars and certainly worthy of serious study—regardless of the question of their authorship or revelatory status.

When assessing the validity of any work, surely it is desirable to do so with an open mind, treating each as a part of our personal search for truth. With this attitude, truth becomes the overriding criterion of value.

# About “Prophetic” Science

Scattered throughout the scientific component we find statements that are quite prophetic. This inclusion is consistent with a statement from the mandate (p. 1110) that the provision of key bits of essential or forgotten knowledge was permitted. However, the inclusion of this esoteric information is strangely in contrast with much of the other science in the book that would have been known even to high school students of the 1930's, when the Papers were first received.

The mandate has these statements: “...future students of such a revelation are tempted to discard...it...because they discover errors….We are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand years...The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired.” (1109)

We must not be put off by perceived errors in the cosmology (which includes science). We have been warned—truth is where you find it.

Stumbling blocks

I've often pondered on the sequence of text that follows the ordination sermon of Jesus to the apostles in Part 4. There, Jesus announces that he is on earth solely to comfort the minds, liberate the spirits, and save the souls of men. After a pause he continues:

“Always must you recognize the two viewpoints of all mortal conduct—the human and the divine; the ways of the flesh and the ways of the spirit; the estimate of time and the viewpoint of eternity.”

This comment is then followed by:

“But you will stumble over my teachings because you are wont to interpret my message literally; you are slow to discover the spirit of my teaching.”

In our reading, most of us probably pass over this admonition, dismissing it as applying to the apostles. But in the same paragraph Jesus says, “Also must you remember that I have sheep not of this flock, and that I am beholden to them also, to the end that I must provide for them the pattern of doing the will of God while living the life of the mortal nature.”

I wonder if we 20th century people might be “sheep not of this flock.” These Galilean fisherfolk were already floundering beyond their depth. They had just asked Jesus for help to understand him. Jesus' comment, if spoken to them, would have thrown them completely. So is it included in the Papers specifically for our benefit? If so, is it telling us not to take the teachings literally?

Perhaps it is only if we interpret much of the Urantia Papers metaphorically or allegorically that we will discover the real spirit of this revelation?

From this different perspective, I can perceive that what I and others were formerly trying to interpret as serious or precise science and history are not necessarily that at all. The real purpose is to provide a background cosmology embracing the totality of creation as a backdrop to a religious belief system. For that purpose images we understand may be more meaningful than fastidious exactitudes.

Prior to reading the Urantia Papers my total knowledge of life beyond this earthly life was contained in Jesus' New Testament words, “In my Father's house there are many mansions. I go to prepare a place for you,”  plus his comment that in heaven we are neither taken nor given in marriage but are as the angels. And my knowledge of God was confounded by opposing images of a God of love, compassion, and mercy at one pole and a vengeful God of righteous justice, judgment, and retribution at the other pole.

The Urantia Papers take away this polarity with a beautifully profound and simple statement—the love and mercy of God, as my heavenly Father, will always transcend his righteousness as my judge. For me, studying the Urantia Papers was worth the effort for that one statement alone. But, in fact, there have been far many more rewards.

With this attitude to the Urantia Papers, I no longer need to perceive the Garden of Eden story as necessarily being a factual history. I can look upon it as a figurative way of increasing my understanding of what the Papers are really about. The choice is mine. Others are free to choose differently without anyone endangering their own rate of spiritual progress or their spiritual potential.

Regardless of whether my interpretation is right or wrong in particular instances, this attitude liberates me to look for hidden lessons and to seek to discern the spirit of these revelatory teachings in contrast to being at loggerheads with myself about matters of factuality.

Of course, new readers must find their own pathway to truth. Some may find my experience to be helpful, others may not. Regardless of what errors we may make in our sincere striving for truth, the God, whose nature is revealed in the Urantia Papers, would never reject us on account of such mistakes.

# Science and The Urantia Papers.

Since the mandate for the revelators prevented them from giving us unearned knowledge, (1109) it follows that the level of scientific information in the Papers should not include information still undiscovered by the mid-1930's. The exception is that “missing gaps” could be filled, or essential “lost knowledge” restored.

By taking a broad view for these exceptions,  our superhuman revelators could easily have demonstrated that their level of scientific knowledge far exceeded human levels at the mid-1930's. By doing so, they could then have demonstrated a revelatory status for the Papers.

In some instances, it seemed to me that the revelators had done precisely that. But long hours of reflection have provided a moderating view.

I was a dedicated follower of Jesus long before I first saw the Urantia Papers. When I read their “Life of Jesus,” I met a Jesus I already knew. Hence, I wanted this revelation to be true.

Others, such as those with a “Martin Gardner” type of mentality, may come to the Papers with a mind set that demands that they find reason to label them  false (in a magazine article, Gardner denigrated the Papers but later admitted to not actually reading them).

The authors of the Papers well understand human nature. They would be aware that both types of reader could be conscientious seekers of their own particular kind of “truth.”

I believe we have been provided with key information for the purpose of aiding those who are seeking the revelators' kind of truth. But they provide this information in ways that also permit its rejection by those who seek the means for rejection.   

The reason for this bivalent approach may be related to the declaration in the Papers that our free will is virtually inviolate. God gifted us with relative free will on the finite level, and not even God himself will take it away. (1299) Also it is only by faith that we can enter God's kingdom. (1569) And we cannot have faith unless there is uncertainty, for if there is certainty there could be no reason for faith.

This paper is an update of two earlier and more detailed publications on the science, anthropology, and archaeology of the Papers.1, 2 In this, I propose to describe only those items of knowledge that, for me,  verify that the Papers are all that they claim to be. I also intend to point out some of the possible escape paths  for rejecting them.

New information about the Papers has come to hand since our previous articles were printed. Although the Urantia Papers included in Parts 1, 2, and 3 of the book were delivered in the 1934/35 period, after they  were received, a selected group was allocated the task of  thoroughly reading one Paper every week during a forty four week period in each subsequent year. At the end of the weekly session, those in attendance were asked to hand in their written questions. Answers were provided during the following session.

These meetings closed down completely for eight weeks during summer of each year. The whole process was repeated three times. Part 4 and the Foreword had a separate history.

Such a process should have taken about eight years to complete. This information fits well with the investigations of Matthew Block who has identified much of the human source material utilized in the writing of the papers. Most of those sources were written during the first third of this century. But a few were published later than 1935, some as late as the 1942/43 period. Apparently this material was added during the process described above.

Of the materials covered in this article, only the article on the energy of stars has post-1935 human source publications.

# Radii of the Electron and Proton.

“If the mass of matter should be magnified until that of an electron equaled one tenth of an ounce, then were the size to be proportionately magnified, the volume of such an electron would become as large as the earth.”  (Paper 42, Sect. 6, p. 477)

I've often wondered how many Urantia Book readers went to the trouble of working through the sums and then put their answer to one side in puzzlement. For it was not until about 1990 that this statement started to make any sense.

If the mass of the electron is taken to be  9.1 x 10-28 grams, 1/10th of an ounce as 2.8 grams and the radius of the earth as 6.4 x 106 meters, then the radius of an electron calculates to be 2 x 10-21 meters.

At the time that the Urantia Papers were received many physicists had assumed the electron was a dimensionless point, hence had no radius. Others, by circuitous reasoning, assigned it a radius of 5 x 10-15 meters, which is of the order of a million times larger than is calculated from the Urantia papers statement.

The statement remained an anomoly until Stefan Tallqvist, a reader from Finland became aware of new work by Nobel Prize winner, Hans Dehmelt, who had devised a way to trap single electrons and maintain them in that state for an extended period of time. With this new technology, Dehmelt was able to measure electron parameters which permitted him to assign a radius of between  10-19 and 10-22 meters!!

Dehmelt's initial work was carried out about 10 years ago. Since that time further refinements have led to a recent announcement1 that places the electron radius at about 10-22 meters.

For those not accustomed to thinking in terms of orders of magnitude the following illustration may help. Assume you are asked to estimate the weight of an iguana about 2 meters in length. In terms of orders of magnitude, is it closer to 10 lbs than to 1 or 100 lbs?  Or perhaps it weighs in as heavy as a decent size crocodile, say 1000lbs. We have covered a range of 100, 101, 102, to 103 orders of magnitude. The Urantia Papers obviously approximate calculation for electron radius is:

0.000,000,000,000,000,000,002 meters.

The most recent measurement says about:

0.000,000,000,000,000,000,000,1 meters.

The difference is eight parts in a thousand million, million, million. Not too bad for approximations.

The question posed is how could such an estimate have been made more than fifty years ago?  And how can the skeptically minded simply ignore it?

The Urantia Paper also has:

“If the volume of a proton—eighteen hundred times as heavy as an electron—should be magnified to the size of the head of a pin, then, in comparison, a pin's head would attain a diameter equal to that of the earth's orbit around the sun.” (Paper 42, Sect. 6, p.477)

Again, we are indebted to Stefan Tallqvist for going to the trouble of actually doing the calculations and drawing attention to the results.

Taking the radius of the Earth's orbit around the sun as 1.5 x 1014 mm and the radius of the pinhead as 1.0 mm, the radius of the proton calculates to be  7 x 10-15 mm which is 7 x 10-18 meters.

The “classical” proton radius is 0.85 x 10-15 meters and again deviated considerably from that given by the calculation from the Urantia Papers.

However the proton is now known to consist of three quarks plus virtual particles that flip in and out of existence. So what actually is the radius of the “real” part of the proton, the three quark system? Modern measurements put it at 7.7 x 10-18 meters.

Do such measurements “prove” that  Urantia Papers are all of what they claim to be? At one time I would probably have answered yes, but after having studied the Papers for so many years and having considered statements of their authors such as “The existence of God can never be proved by scientific experiment” and “revelation is validated only by human experience,” my conclusion would now be more conservative.

I am aware that I want these Papers  to be truth. I also believe that if they are not the truth, then they ought to be. By that I mean that the God whom I first came to know through the revelation of his nature as described in the Gospels stories, is depicted better in the Urantia Papers than anywhere else that I know of.

Thus my interpretation of the Urantia Paper's science cannot be anything but affected by my yearnings.  And perhaps excessively so.

I do not know, and cannot really imagine, what kind of bias and prejudice influences the judgment of the Martin Gardner type of mind. But I can see how the evidence that I perceive as strongly supporting my views, can nevertheless be given a different slant.

Regarding the radius of the electron measurement, the point can be raised that there is very strong evidence to support the notion that a “normal” electron is in a state of “superpositioning,”  a kind of limbo state in which it has both wave and particle properties at the same time. Similarly an electron can have either “up” or “down” spin. In its “normal” state it has both at the same time.

It is believed that the electron only takes on a definite configuration when forced to do so by an observer. If an observer chooses to see it as a wave, what meaning does its radius have? Only if the observer chooses to “observe” it in an appropriate conformation  will it have a definable radius.

The cynic, the skeptic, the agnostic the atheist, the egocentric, those who simply don't care, such will always find a reason to reject any evidence that does not fit with their philosophy or life style. It is meant to be that way, for without the freedom to make such choices, there can be no free will. Faith and faith alone is the key to God's kingdom. And, as Bryan Appleyard has said, “If we had reason for faith, it would not be faith at all. It would be logic”

# What fuels our Sun and other Stars?

“In those suns which are encircuited in the space-energy channels, solar energy is  liberated by various complex nuclear-reaction chains, the most common of which is the hydrogen-carbon-helium reaction. In this metamorphosis, carbon acts as an energy catalyst since it is in no way actually changed by this process of converting hydrogen into helium. Under certain conditions of high temperature the hydrogen penetrates the carbon nuclei. Since the carbon cannot hold more than four such protons, when this saturation state is attained, it begins to emit protons as fast as new ones arrive. In this reaction the ingoing hydrogen particles come forth as a helium atom.” (Paper 41, Sect. 8, p. 464)

During the early years of the century, attempts to account for the energy liberated by stars such as our sun had all failed. In 1929, Atkinson and Houtermans were able to show that some kind of nuclear process is the only way that would account for the exceedingly high temperatures thought to exist at the center of the sun. In 1938, Bethe and Critchfield formulated the proton-proton chain reaction by which smaller stars such as our sun produced their energy and in 1939, Bethe described another reaction in which carbon catalyses helium production in larger stars.

When I first read The Urantia Book account of the carbon cycle, it unsettled me. I knew about Hans Bethe having published it and a check told me 1939 was the date of publication. From literature accounts it was doubtful that he had proposed it as early as 1935 and it did not appear to fit the Urantia Paper's definition in the mandate of categories of unearned knowledge that were permitted to be revealed. But I was assured that nothing had been added to the text after 1935 and so had to accept it as in the “prophetic” category. Not until after Matthew Block began to uncover human source materials published between 1935 and 1943 did I learn about the process of questions and answers I've already described.

It was through Matthew's careful comparison of word sequences in phrases in the relevant Urantia Paper, and in a paper published in 1942 by George Gamow, a Russian-born physicist resident in the USA, that I became aware of additions and alterations made post-1935.

The skeptics would say I told you so and dismiss the Urantia Paper material as irrelevant rather than prophetic. However there are points of interest that indicate that the Urantia Paper's author did not simply copy bits of the Gamow paper but had the necessary specialist knowledge to weed out the wheat from the chaff so as not to copy Gamow's errors.

Gamow states that the carbon cycle, as described by Bethe in 1939, is the chain of reactions “responsible for energy production in the sun  and all other stars of the main sequence...”

In contrast, the Urantia Paper tells us that the energy of the stars is “liberated by various complex nuclear reaction chains, the most common of which is the hydrogen-carbon-helium reaction…” In actuality, our sun is small enough to be one of the class of stars that is fuelled by the proton-proton chain reaction during its hydrogen to helium burning stage. The Urantia Paper avoids Gamow's mistake which states that the sun utilizes the carbon cycle.

Gamow next discusses the later stages of a star's lifetime and follows that with a section called “Stellar Catastrophes” which includes novae and supernovae, events in which stars first contract and later explode. 

Following the discovery of the neutron in 1932,Baade and Zwicky  proposed that neutron stars were the final product of supernova implosion. The evidence was slender indeed and because of  Zwicky's reputation of unreliability, the idea was largely ignored. Gamow was a better physicist than Zwicky but also was considered unreliable by many.1

In 1941, Gamow and Schoenberg2 published a paper proposing that a hypothetical particle, known to physicists as the neutrino, was the means by which the energy of a supernova explosion could be conducted from the star's interior to its exterior thus permitting it to collapse in a matter of minutes. Nobel Prize winning physicist Wolfgang Pauli had originally invented the neutrino in 1932 as a particle with no properties to account for energy balance discrepancies during radioactive decay of the atomic nucleus. This particle was not actually proven to exist until 1956. Gamow and his group also published a series of highly speculative papers in the 1940 period in which the Hubble expansion of the universe was conceived to originate from a thermonuclear fireball. Unfortunately many of their details of thermonucleogenesis by which elements were interconverted were later shown to be erroneous and  Gamow's team was disbanded, “its work ignored and disdained.”

From Matthew Block's comparisons I have to accept that the Gamow's 1942 review paper was also the source of the following Urantia Book comment.

“In large suns—small circular nebulae—when hydrogen is exhausted and gravity contraction ensues, if such a body is not sufficiently opaque to retain the internal pressure of support for the outer gas regions, then a sudden collapse occurs. The gravity-electric     changes give origin to vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential, and such particles readily  escape from the solar interior, thus bringing about the collapse of a gigantic sun within a few days. It was such an emigration of these ”runaway particles“ that occasioned the collapse of the giant nova of the Andromeda nebula about fifty years ago. This vast stellar body collapsed in forty minutes of Urantia time.” (Paper 41, Sect. 8, p.464)

The “vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential” are the neutrinos, not shown to exist until 1956. The paper that provided the theoretical basis for understanding supernovae was written in 19573 but did not concede a role to neutrinos. Proof of the actual existence of the neutron star did not come until the 1960's when observations with radiotelescopes identified a rapidly rotating body named a pulsar in the Crab nebula that could not be a white dwarf star. The final proof came from observations made from the orbiting X-ray observatory in 1967 and neutrino bursts detected from a supernova in the Cloud of Magellan in 1987.

Gamow's intuition about the role of neutrinos was correct but he succumbed to opinion of the day and decided against the Zwicky hypothesis of neutron star formation. Instead he concluded that for large stars above the so-called Chandresekhar critical mass  of 1.4 sun masses, the rapid collapse of supernovae would still culminate in the formation of a white dwarf star, as often happens with smaller stars.

It is noteworthy that the author of the Urantia Paper has described the formation of white dwarf stars in the paragraph preceding our last p. 464 quotation, but has again avoided repeating Gamow's error of concluding that the same fate awaits those large stars that collapse as supernovae. The chances of doing this must be small for any other than a highly knowledgeable author.

So what were the chances of even the professional scientist correctly guessing in the early 1940's that an unconfirmed particle with no properties would be the catalyst for the formation of neutron stars? Surely they must be exceedingly remote. Zwicky himself made no such assertion, concluding that cosmic rays were the outcome of the explosion. And the Burbidges who, with Fowler and Hoyle wrote the theoretical basis for understanding supernovae in 1957, also failed to ascribe a role to the neutrino.

So is the Urantia Paper account “prophetic” despite the addition of materials subsequent to 1935? Each must decide for themselves. My own guess is that there is very highly probability of it being so.

# Continental Drift

In detailing their account of  life and land evolution  on our planet in Urantia Papers 57, 58, 59 and 60, the authors have wholeheartedly embraced the concept of continental drift, an idea first touted by Alfred Wegener in 1910. Take away continental drift from these four Papers and they collapse as a somewhat messy heap.

In a our previous papers, my co-authors and I drew attention to the fact that, over the period in which the Urantia Papers were received and published (1934-1955), the concept of continental drift was held only tenuously, and by very few geologists. Antipathy to the concept was stated to have been particularly strong in the USA. This antipathy lasted through from the early 1920's to well into the 1960 period.

In our view, if the Urantia Papers had actually been written by human authors, it would have been quite irrational for them to go against the grain of prevailing strong professional opinion in making their story of life and land evolution so highly dependent upon the truth of the continental drift theory.

In support of our view that opposition to the theory was extremely strong, we cited a recently published book by science historian, H.E. Le Grand1, as well as earlier criticisms of Wegener's theory by eminent geologist, R.T. Chamberlin in which he listed 18 points that he considered were destructive of the hypothesis.

Gardner's critique2 of our continental draft account is an example of what Meredith Sprunger described as the irrelevant conclusion fallacy.3 Gardner found publications by a handful of European and South African geologists who supported Wegener's ideas. Gardner rambled on about them, gave trivial details of various conferences and postulates, and then finished with “The four Urantian authors also make much of two ancient supernova explosions.” 

As a technique for distracting his readers, Gardner's method may be effective with uncritical readers. But as a supposedly professional demolition job, it is hardly praiseworthy. In addition to diverting attention through his citation of comparative irrelevancies, Gardner has pulled out another of the tricks of his trade. He totally ignored important items for which he had no explanation.

For the continental drift story of the Urantia Papers, the major “prophetic” item is the actual starting date for drift, given as 750 million years ago.

As his starting date for drift, Wegener had suggested 200-300 million years ago, a view that remained dominant until the 1980's when the commencing date was pushed back to 500 million years or more. A recent estimate4 actually coincides exactly with the 750 million years given in Urantia Paper 57.

[Note: Geological dating of this kind is by no means an exact science. The estimate of “750” may mean “closer to 750 than to either 700 or 800 million.”]

A review of “plate tectonics,” the new name for “continental drift,” appears in the recent CDROM edition of Encyclopedia Britannica and states, “...disbelief (in Wegener's continental drift) was so strong that it often bordered on indignation. One of the strongest opponents was the British geophysicist Sir Harold Jeffreys, who spent years attempting to demonstrate that continental drift is impossible because the strength of the mantle should be far greater than any conceivable driving force….It was in North America, however, that opposition to Wegener's ideas was vigorous to the point of excess and very nearly unanimous….Wegener was attacked from virtually every possible vantage point, his paleontological evidence attributed to land bridges, the similarity of strata on both sides of the Atlantic called into question, the fit of Atlantic shores declared inaccurate, and his very competence doubted….”—and much more.  Martin Gardner's dedication to his self-appointed task may be undoubted, but it has little in common with truth-seeking.

If the authors of the Urantia Papers were human, we need an explanation of how they were able come up with their extraordinary concepts on the timing of the continental drift phenomenon. A then-discredited Wegener said 200 million years as the start of break-up of a supercontinient, the Urantia Papers' authors put it at 750 million years, and it appears that both are correct, the explanation being that the supercontinent reformed, then broke up a second time. Wegener had some evidence to support his ideas. There appears to have been absolutely no evidence whatever to support the 750 million years breakup at the time the Urantia Papers were written or published.

A lucky guess seems to be the only alternative. But the odds against guessing correctly are enormous.

# What If?

What if the Urantia Papers had actually been written by a committee bent upon saving the world? Such a committee would need to have included expert-level knowledge of the Bible, the archaeology and history of the first century Palestine area, a substantial knowledge of the Roman world, plus expertise in chemistry, geology, history, physics, and general science.

The writing of the 2000-page Urantia Book would have required an enormous amount of time and effort. Hence it would be logical for the authors to have been highly selective in making guesses about future discoveries that could come within the scope of the “missing gap” information“ allowed by the mandate.  Further discussion of some of this supposed ”missing gap," unearned, but prophetic information follows.

# Origin of the Solar System.

The Papers place the time of origin of the solar system at 4.5 billion years at a time when the Hubble expansion of the universe was (and still is) thought to be the best indicator of the age of the universe. In 1952, it was discovered that the then current estimate of universe age of about 2 billion years was incorrect because the wrong type of  Cepheid variable star had been used to help make the estimate. A revised estimate was about 4 to 5 billion years, which made the universe the same age as the Urantia Paper's estimate for the age of the solar system.

In 1955, the year of printing for The Urantia Book, a radiometric measurement of the age of meteorite material gave a value of 4.6 billion years. Some astronomers thought this would be a valid estimate of the age of the solar system.

Was it possible for the Urantia Paper's estimate to have been based on this measurement? To do so would have required a considerable rewriting of other material on the evolutionary history of our planet. The old style metal printing plates for the book were with the printer. It seems likely that the time factor alone rules out such a possibility. Other factors also need consideration.

The hypothetical “expert” responsible should have known that many of the elements found on our planet must have origin in stars that have completed their life cycle and exploded in a nova. The cosmic dust that gave us the solar system is of secondary origin, and not from any Big Bang, so must be considerably younger than the universe itself to allow for galaxy formation and recycling of stars. Thus the Hubble-based estimate of universe age and the meteorite estimate of solar system age were quite incompatible. But did the radiometric estimate of a meteorite's age really reflect the age of the solar system? While possible, there was still insufficient information to be certain.

So even if the time factor permitted use of the meteorite data, because of the conflicting evidence, for this hypothetical “expert” to do so would appear to have been irresponsible.

# Arrival of the Red Man in the Americas.

The Urantia Papers put this at 85,000 years ago. Clovis was the archaeological site in New Mexico that, in the 1930's, gave rise to the date of arrival as about 11,000 years ago. Deviation from this date has been hotly opposed  to the point of irrationality. Only in the last few years have alternative views been considered, some as late as 40,000 years ago.

Some recent estimates use a mitochondrial DNA clock and go to 78,000 years ago. One curiosity is that man appears to have arrived at the southern tip of South America by 10,000 years ago.

In view of the uncertainties when the Papers were written, why did our hypothetical committee expert hazard the 85,000 years ago guess?.

# Mountain Building.

The Urantia Papers associate the processes of mountain building and drifting continents as being responsible for the chain of mountains on the west coast of the Americas reaching from Alaska to the bottom of South America. (689)

Modern readers probably do not give the statement a passing thought. But until the mid-1950's and even later, continental drift was classified as a no-go heresy amongst the great majority of geologists.  So why did the hypothetical committee of experts include it as a major factor for mountain building?

The Urantia Paper's account of the evolution of the continents and the planet's living organisms, if read prior to about 1960, would have been in the “stranger than fiction” category. As a generality, it is highly prophetic.

Today, only those well versed in current concepts of details of this account would be aware that there are important differences. However, in terms of the authors stated aims of synthesizing science and religion into a consistent universe philosophy, their account is admirable.

But what would the situation have been if all of their detail had been highly accurate?

The answer we give to that question reflects our progress in understanding the purposes of this first phase of our universe career. Salvation, we are told, is by faith—and by faith alone. (1593) To understand that fact is to appreciate the peculiarities of these Urantia Papers.

# Monster dinosaurs in Australia.

The Papers state that monstrous dinosaur remains lie buried in America, western Europe, South Africa, India, but not in Australia. (687) Dinosaur fossils occur in Australia but to the present (1998), none are of the monster class. When the Papers were written, there was almost no knowledge available in Australia about its dinosaurs. So on what evidence did the experts hazard their guess? To be wrong would make the book look ridiculous. But it does little to impress readers, even if correct.

# Marsupial migration.

The Papers say that the ancestors of kangaroos roamed Australia 45 million years ago, and that 35 million years ago there was a land bridge re-connecting Australia, Antartica, and South America.

Marsupial fossils are found in Upper Oligocene strata (35-40 million years ago) in Australia and as far back as the Cretaceous in South America (about 65 million years ago). Marsupial fossils have also been found on Seymour Island in the Antarctic. Fossil evidence  indicates that marsupials did not reach Australia from either Asia or Africa.

Again, most modern readers would pass over this information without realizing that, when written, the concept of  continental drift up until the 1960's, was still a major heresy. Now the linking of these three continents constitutes an accepted part of the theory.

So the statement on marsupial migration and drifting continents had to be just another lucky guess by our hypothetical committee expert—for there was no evidence to presume migration via the Antarctic could occur. As with continental drift and mountain building, to be wrong makes the book look silly, to be correct does little for it except for readers conversant with geology and paleontology.

# 100 Stable Elements.

“In Orvonton it has never been possible naturally to assemble over one hundred orbital electrons in one atomic system. When one hundred and one have been artificially introduced into the orbital field, the result has always been the instantaneous disruption....” (Paper 42, Sect. 7, p. 478)

The text above is from the first printing, someone having taken the liberty of adding the words “well-nigh” before “instantaneous” in subsequent printings. The important word to keep in mind is “naturally.”

It had been known since the 1930's that new elements should be produced by neutron bombardment of an element which would be followed by a beta decay process in which an atomic nucleus with a captured neutron loses an electron. In doing so, one of the nuclear neutrons becomes a proton. Such an element moves to be the next element upwards in the periodic table.

In the 1940's Bohr made a prediction (that turned out to be true) that the beta decay process would cease with element 100. Thus no element above this atomic number could be produced by the neutron capture, beta decay process. This appears to be the process that the revelators regard as natural.

Elements as high as 112 have been produced by other means and all are highly unstable. Element 101, (mendelevium-256) was produced in 1955 by helium ion bombardment of einsteinium-253. Element 102 (nobelium) was produced by bombarding element 96 (curium) with carbon atoms.

It is doubtful whether this type of reaction occurs “naturally” even in supernova explosions. That it can be done in the laboratory is a tribute to the ingenuity of  the people involved. In a recent publication, it was stated that new elements with half lives less than 10 microseconds can be identified even if, out of 10 billion trials, only two nuclei fuse together once to form a superheavy new element. The single atom so produced will be both detected and identified!1

The possibility for these superheavy elements occurring naturally in novae explosions may be remote. And even if they were produced, the product would usually decay in an instant.

The Urantia papers use that word “instant” and its derivatives in many different contexts. For example, they say that human beings, “from a cosmic perspective, are born, live, and die in a relative instant of time.” In terms of a cosmic perspective, elements above 100, and quite a few below, can exist for only a relative instant of time and many scarcely or not at all.

The important point about the 100 elements comment is that, when made, it was “prophetic.” The Fermi theory about neutron capture and beta decay had been established in 1937 with the production of technetium from molybdenum. However its cessation at element 100 was not empirically established until the mid-1950's. Hence there was only very meager and uncertain evidence for an “expert” to use the concept in the Papers.

# Piltdown Man

A highly topical subject of public and scientific interest in the 1930's was the “missing link” concept, the fossil evidence that would indisputably tie human evolution to that of our “cousins,” the ape family.

In Bain et al., “The Science Content of The Urantia Book” (1991), we drew attention to the fact that in their discussion of our evolution, the Urantia Papers mention Java man, Peking man, Heidelberg man, Cromagnon man, and Neanderthal man but fail to mention the one that was the most topical of them all in the mid 1930's—the Piltdown man. Of him, the famed Louis Leakey wrote in his 1934 book, Adam's Ancestors, "the Piltdown skull is probably very much more nearly related to Homo sapiens than to any other known type. We also quoted from Martin J. Reader's 1981 book, Missing Links that Piltdown man was not debunked as a fake until the 1950's period.

Our references were not enough to prevent Martin Gardner from indicating that the omission of a reference to Piltdown man in The Urantia Papers is of no consequence because everyone knew the Piltdown thing was a fake.

In A Scientific Forgery (1990), which was not available to us for our paper, Frank Spencer elaborated on earlier work by the Australian historian Ian Langham, voicing his opinion that the Piltdown forgery  “had been tailored to withstand scientific scrutiny and thereby promote a particular interpretation of the human fossil record.” It remained controversial and hotly disputed until fluorine dating and other tests had shown in 1953 and 1954, that the skull was a skillfully disguised fragment of a modern human cranium about 50,000 years of age. Which makes the omission of a reference to it in the Urantia Papers somewhat remarkable after all—and Gardner once again wrong on all counts.

# On “Prophesy”

The “prophetic” information discussed is only a sample but should be sufficient for any open minded reader to decide that these Papers must surely be worthy of  their attention.

Besides the prophetic information that turns out to be correct, well-informed readers will also find materials that are well out-of date. That must be accepted as inevitable because the terms of the mandate limited the authors to our 1930's level of knowledge.

But any really close and serious examination of the “prophetic” information provided herein will require that those with the prior intention of rejecting the Papers are forced to stretch their “truth” beyond reasonable limits in order to placate their conscience.

For me personally, this prophetic material had little to do with my conviction that the revelation is what it says it is. In Part 4, I met the Jesus I had already known for many years. The Urantia Papers expanded that knowledge and then provided the bonus of an intimate knowledge, and a far better understanding, of Father, Son, and Holy Spirit—plus an overall view of a magnificent and incredible Creation, its purposes, and my own role therein. Also, I found that the quality of its text placed this work in a class all of its own, making it worth reading regardless of any claim to “inspiration”

Faith and personal experience, not science or even quality, is the key that elevates the spiritual content of the Papers to any exalted level. Virtually everybody could gain value from a study of the Urantia Papers, regardless of their authorship. As with the teachings and life of Jesus of Nazareth, they have the potential to change the individual, and the world in which we live.

From the Urantia Papers.

“To isolate part of life and call it religion is to disintegrate life and to distort religion.” (1134)

“Man's greatest spiritual jeopardy consists in partial progress, the predicament of unfinished growth; modern science, particularly psychology, has weakened only those religions which are so largely dependent on fear, superstition, and emotion.” (1090)

“The philosophic elimination of religious fear and the steady progress of science add greatly to the mortality of false gods; and even though these casualties of man-made deities may momentarily befog the spiritual vision, they eventually destroy the ignorance and superstition which so long obscured the living God of eternal love.” (1134)

“Be not discouraged; human evolution is still in progress, and the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.” (1134)
