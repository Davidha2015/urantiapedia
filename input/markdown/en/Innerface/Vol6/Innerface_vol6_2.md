# Morals, Virtue, and Personality

Intelligence alone cannot explain the moral nature. Morality, virtue, is indigenous to human personality. Moral intuition, the realization of duty, is a component of human mind endowment and is associated with the other inalienables of human nature: scientific curiosity and spiritual insight. Man's mentality far transcends that of his animal cousins, but it is his moral and religious natures that especially distinguish him from the animal world.

The selective response of an animal is limited to the motor level of behavior. The supposed insight of the higher animals is on a motor level and usually appears only after the experience of motor trial and error. Man is able to exercise scientific, moral, and spiritual insight prior to all exploration or  experimentation.

Only a personality can know what it is doing before it does it; only personalities possess insight in advance of experience. A personality can look before it leaps and can therefore learn from looking as well as from leaping. A nonpersonal animal ordinarily learns only by leaping.

As a result of experience an animal becomes able to examine the different ways of attaining a goal and to select an approach based on accumulated experience. But a personality can also examine the goal itself and pass judgment on its worth-whileness, its value. Intelligence alone can discriminate as to the best means of attaining indiscriminate ends, but a moral being possesses an insight which enables him to discriminate between ends as well as between means. And a moral being in choosing virtue is nonetheless intelligent. He knows what he is doing, why he is doing it, where he is going, and how he will get there.

When man fails to discriminate the ends of his mortal striving, he finds himself functioning on the animal level of existence. He has failed to avail himself of the superior advantages of that material acumen, moral discrimination, and spiritual insight which are an integral part of his cosmic-mind endowment as a personal being.

Virtue is righteousness—conformity with the cosmos. To name virtues is not to define them, but to live them is to know them. Virtue is not mere knowledge nor yet wisdom but rather the reality of progressive experience in the attainment of ascending levels of cosmic achievement. In the day-by-day life of mortal man, virtue is realized by the consistent choosing of good rather than evil, and such choosing ability is evidence of the possession of a moral nature.

Man's choosing between good and evil is influenced, not only by the keenness of his moral nature, but also by such influences as ignorance, immaturity, and delusion. A sense of proportion is also concerned in the exercise of virtue because evil may be perpetrated when the lesser is chosen in the place of the greater as a result of distortion or deception. The art of relative estimation or comparative measurement enters into the practice of the virtues of the moral realm.

Man's moral nature would be impotent without the art of measurement, the discrimination embodied in his ability to scrutinize meanings. Likewise would moral choosing be futile without that cosmic insight which yields the consciousness of spiritual values. From the standpoint of intelligence, man ascends to the level of a moral being because he is endowed with personality.

Morality can never be advanced by law or by force. It is a personal and freewill matter and must be disseminated by the contagion of the contact of morally fragrant persons with those who are less morally responsive, but who are also in some measure desirous of doing the Father's will.

Moral acts are those human performances which are characterized by the highest intelligence, directed by selective discrimination in the choice of superior ends as well as in the selection of moral means to attain these ends. Such conduct is virtuous.

Supreme virtue, then, is wholeheartedly to choose to do the will of the Father in heaven. (Paper 16, Sect. 7)

# On Pragmatism

While eating supper, Jesus had the talk with Matthew in which he explained that the morality of any act is determined by the individual's motive. Jesus' morality was always positive. The golden rule as restated by Jesus demands active social contact; the older negative rule could be obeyed in isolation. Jesus stripped morality of all rules and ceremonies and elevated it to majestic levels of spiritual thinking and truly righteous living. (1585)

By taking the pragmatic pathway, some Urantians appear to have stripped this statement by Jesus to the minimal level of, "The morality of any act is determined by the motive." This resultant is then taken as divine authority for an "end justifies the means" attitude which sanctions utilizing immoral or unlawful means for the attainment of what are claimed to be moral ends.

Surely this kind of approach is a debasement of Jesus' restatement of the golden rule in which he elevated morality concepts to "majestic levels of spiritual thinking and truly righteous living." And is it not  also contrary to teachings such as  found in our "Favorite Places" quotation requiring "selective discrimination in the choice of superior ends as well as in the selection of moral means to attain these ends?"

For two millennia, most Christians have self-righteously set aside Jesus' teachings from the Sermon on the Mount as being impractical. Instead, they have turned to Paul's Christology which virtually ignores Jesus' life and teachings and, in its place, substitutes his death as a sacrificial means of freeing them from responsibility for their actions.

And now, despite its two thousand pages of contrary teaching, we find readers of the Urantia  Papers following the pragmatism of Paul with the justification that "it is the real world that we have to live in."

Did Jesus not live in a "real" world? He most certainly did—and he accepted the consequences of doing so. I would surely hate to have to stand in front of Michael and explain why I did things my way rather than  his way because it was a "real" world that I had to live in—thereby implying that, as Jesus of Nazareth, he did not.

But if knowingly and willfully, I had gone my own way rather than the way of Jesus, can I really be sure that I would get the opportunity to stand in front of Michael to offer my explanations?

Quotes that come to mind are, "Our relationship to Jesus takes precedence to all other human relationships." And, "You cannot yield the fruits of loving service except you abide in me."

If our relationship to Jesus must take precedence over all else, and if "no abiding" means "no fruits" and "no fruits" means "no soul growth," then do we not run the risk, perhaps certainty, of soul death?

Or is there an "out" in the statement about the faintest flicker of faith always giving us another chance? Probably not, for if we read on we come to, "But you who have been called out of darkness into the light are expected to believe with a whole heart; your faith shall dominate the combined attitudes of body, mind, and spirit." (1733)

Obviously Jesus did not live in any kind of "real" world in which, for him, the end would justify the use of immoral means. Always it was the will of the Father that had first priority—with the result that Jesus always appears to have been forced to take the hard way. No miracles, no walking on the water, no reprieve from the cross.

The way of Jesus was the way of the cross. Amazingly he went to his death with supreme joy in his heart, even though experiencing outward sorrow. (1944)

Jesus' human heart had longed to find some legitimate avenue of escape from the terrible plight of suffering and sorrow confronting him. There were a million and one ways by which Jesus could have escaped the cross, but none fell within the requirement of the Father that the termination of his bestowal on this planet should be "in the natural course of events."

In the real world of Jesus' day, anyone who forsook the animal component of human make up in order to live solely "according to the spirit," was treading a dangerous path. It is this same pathway that we are offered in the Urantia Papers. We are to forsake our animal nature, the same nature that figures that the pragmatic end justifies an immoral means—which is, in reality, the law of the jungle. Instead, we are to take on board,  the mind and the nature of Jesus.

Embracing "the end justifies the means" concept appears to be a dangerous ploy. I suppose its proponents could always try a plea of ignorance. What else is there?

# Patience—a Millennium is 1000 Years

Ken Glasziou

"Mechanical inventions and the dissemination of knowledge are modifying civilization; certain economic adjustments and social changes are imperative if cultural disaster is to be avoided. This new and oncoming social order will not settle down complacently for a millennium. The human race must become reconciled to a procession of changes, adjustments, and readjustments. Mankind is on the march toward a new and unrevealed planetary destiny." (Paper 99, Section 1)

Human evolution proceeds at a snail's pace. In fact further genetic improvement of the human race has probably ceased, and is not likely to resume until acceptable selection criteria are agreed upon. Even then, it may take thousands of years before significant improvement is achieved. Hence, in referring to a millennium of change, the revelators must be speaking dominantly about changes to the mores of human society—which are dependent on changes to the individuals that constitute a society.

Perhaps it is the Eastern rather than the Western world that is destined to bring us the necessary changes—for there is a very deeply embedded "thinking pattern" indigenous to the western world which is highly resistant to change. The revelators refer to such patterns as "universe" or "concept" frames.

Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a universe frame in which to think. If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates. And while such universe frames for creature thought are indispensable to rational intellectual operations, they are, without exception, erroneous to a greater or lesser degree. (1260)

Perhaps mainly due to the influence of the ancient Greeks, Westerners mainly think in a "yes or no," "on or off,"  "this or that," "either/or" mode of thinking that chooses between incompatible alternatives. But in the Eastern world, "both this and that" is the more usual way  of considering reality.

The "universe frame" that is apparent in the Urantia Papers is far closer to Eastern "both/and" thinking than it is to the either/or thinking of the West that seeks to exclude any middle ground.

The vast majority of research workers in the Western world, whose interests are in the field of mind and neurophysiology, give credence only to the single postulate that every aspect of human behavioral characteristics has its roots in our animal origins.

In contrast, the Urantia Papers provide us with information on the structure of our mind and our personality that differentiates between an animal-origin and a spirit-origin component of our make up.

Mind, the revelators tell us, is derived from the Infinite Spirit, the source of Cosmic Mind. Mind is tailored to the needs of the creature and, for the human type of mind, comes already endowed with specific attributes such as self-consciousness and the ability to differentiate between relative right and wrong.

Our minds also interact with other components that go to make up our selfhood. Our personality is a gift from the Universal Father. With "personality" come the dual characteristics of relative free will and the capacity, through will, to utilize qualities inherent in Cosmic Mind.

Our first free will moral decision signals the coming of our Thought Adjuster to indwell our minds. On our request, we are also graced with the presence of the Spirit of Truth from our Creator Son. These two spirits then act as one in guiding and fostering those spiritual attributes of our being that are capable of fostering our soul growth—and thereby  differentiates our soul from that animal-origin component of our make-up that responds only to the cause-effect sensory signals emanating from our material environment.

It appears to be factual that Western civilization promotes the almost exclusive development of those animal-origin components of our being by which attention is focussed upon our interactions with the material components of the environment.

There is a positive feedback in this situation. The more we focus attention on the material environment, the more important it becomes to us, hence the more we develop its potentials which thereby demands more and more of our attention. Hence there is positive feedback—and an inherently explosive progression.

Automatically that means we Westerners give little thought and even less time to our spiritual progress  and the fostering of our souls.

And so it is not surprising that the vast majority of western people are not at all spiritually orientated but are dominated by materialism and the animal-origin aspects of their being.

The prospects for advancing the teachings of the Urantia Papers in the western world appear to be very limited indeed.

Traditions are quite different in the Hindu and Buddhist worlds of the East. To present a Westerner with a revelation is to automatically set in motion an "either/or" train of thought. The Westerner will analyze what he or she reads, dividing into alternative but mutually exclusive possibilities—such as "it is either divinely authoritative or it is not," one of which must be totally rejected.

In contrast, the Easterner is more likely to utilize a traditional "both/and" attitude, and accept what he or she finds valuable which then becomes incorporated into the body of  their treasured beliefs.

To we Westerners, China and its people are a strange, wonderful, but almost totally unknown quantity. The breakdown of communism in Russia generated an unexpected repercussion stemming from the previous  repression of religion. By analogy with Russia, something similar may occur among the Chinese people. Perhaps it will be these people who will prove to be a fertile ground for the wisdom and spirituality of the Urantia Papers?

There are some interesting pointers in The Urantia Book in which the revelators draw attention to Eastern people. They do so for a purpose—leaving us to discover that purpose and to implement the necessary action. They do it that way because the Universal Father has decreed that our free will is sacrosanct.

"Today, in India, the great need is for the portrayal of the Jesusonian gospel—the Fatherhood of God and the sonship and consequent brotherhood of all men, which is personally realized in loving ministry and social service. In India the philosophical framework is existent, the cult structure is present; all that is needed is the vitalizing spark of the dynamic love portrayed in the original gospel of the Son of Man, divested of the Occidental dogmas and doctrines which have tended to make Michael's life bestowal a white man's religion." (1032)

Are these objectionable dogmas completely absent from the Urantia Papers?  If not, then should they be modified or removed before introducing a translation to these people? (And already I hear echos emanating from our either/or thinkers screaming that in no circumstances can the text be modified. To which, I reply, "Read  Section 7 from Paper 2.")

Referring to Buddhism, the revelators say:

"At the time of this writing, much of Asia rests its hope in Buddhism. Will this noble faith, that has so valiantly carried on through the dark ages of the past, once again receive the truth of expanded cosmic realities even as the disciples of the great teacher in India once listened to his proclamation of new truth? Will this ancient faith respond once more to the invigorating stimulus of the presentation of new concepts of God and the Absolute for which it has so long searched?" (1041)

With some emphasis having at long last been placed on the translation of the Papers into other languages, there is now an accompanying need to consider how the content of the Papers might assist to speed up the spiritual progress of religionists of "all kinds."

"All kinds" must be inclusive of those of our brothers and sisters who are born into societies whose "universe frame" is highly antagonistic to many concepts found in the Urantia Papers. For example, many sects of Islam (and some of Christianity) appear not to have any chance whatsoever that the Urantia Papers' teachings could be introduced in toto within the foreseeable future.

But possibly even those sects that are locked into an apparently incompatible belief system could benefit from specific concepts of the Papers. Those that tell of the nature and qualities of the Universal Father, and of the virtues of our membership in the family of God are possible candidates.

We have a whole millennium in which to work. A gradual approach appears to be the only one likely to succeed. But that is a task for specialists—and for the Spirit of Truth.

# Let's Make and Keep it Simple

How can we know if we are spirit indwelt? How can we know if we are spirit-led? How can we know right from wrong? How can we know truth? Left entirely to our own resources, we simply could not be sure. But the Urantia Papers provide us with simple ways to check ourselves out. So let's make and keep it simple.

Urantia Paper 115 tells us about "universe frames."

"Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a universe frame in which to think."  (1260)

Some psychologists believe that we complete our "universe frame" before we attain about 10 years of age and it then stays with us, almost invariant, for the remainder of our lives.

Our "universe frame" does not need to be invariant. We can change it if that is our desire. Most of us formed our frames in the absence of many of the truths provided to us in the Urantia Papers. We need to recast our frame of thinking in the light of this new knowledge. No magic or special techniques are required. Faith, determination, and persistence will accomplish the task.

The Urantia Papers tell us that we have a Thought Adjuster, an indwelling spirit from the Universal Father. Faith it is so, will confirm it is so. If we would like additional assurance, then The Urantia Book confirms that "none is good but God" (2097) and that "all goodness takes origin in the Father." (93)

So let's keep our thought process simple. Have we ever had a good thought? If so, we know it came from God. And how else but via our Thought Adjuster? So let's embed that knowledge in our own "universe frame."

How can we know right from wrong, good from bad? The Papers tell us our minds have origin in the Universe Mother Spirit and are a component of cosmic mind. Mind comes to us already endowed with certain attributes, among them, an innate sense of moral values and an ability to differentiate relative right and wrong—to know "good" when it presents itself.

How can we know truth? Here again we have the innate capacities of our minds coupled with the qualities of our personalities which are gifts from the Universal Father. Personality is a unifier and an activator, and is empowered with the capacity to examine goals and pass judgment on their value.

Added to that we have the gift of the Spirit of Truth from our Universe Creator Son. The Spirit of Truth never makes us conscious of himself. He does make us conscious of Jesus. The more we know about Jesus, his life and his teachings, the more the Spirit of Truth can help us. The Spirit of Truth is the conviction of truth. (1949) If we consciously and conscientiously seek truth, we will become convicted of it when we find it.

Marring all of our efforts is another component of ourselves that has its origin in our animal ancestry. It tends to divert our motives from being service-orientated to being self-serving. Allowed to get the upper hand, our animal ancestry will ensure our soul death. But it really is not all that difficult to defeat—simply being a matter of motivation. Get rid of selfish ambitions, set the mind on serving our Creator-Son, and the spirit forces within will be enabled to release our potentials of mind and personality.

Remember always that wealth, fame, fortune, reputation, or anything else accumulated by self, for self, stays right here on Earth when we die. Not even a whisper of our animalistic worldly accomplishments goes with us, for all self-orientated accomplishments are totally devoid of spiritual value.

So just make it simple and keep it simple. In all things, seek to serve God. In doing so, we immediately become wealthy.

# Hear Ye! Hear Ye! All Harbingers of Hope, Keepers of the Copyright, and Protectors of an Inviolate Text, hear this:

From the parable of the talents: The servant who had received only the one talent came forward, saying to his master: "...I was afraid to risk aught of that which was intrusted to me. I safely hid your talent in the earth; here it is; you now have what belongs to you." (1917)

But to the one who buried his talent, his master replied:

"You are an indolent and slothful servant...." And then to the Chief Steward, this lord said: "Take away this one talent from this unprofitable servant and give it to him who has the ten talents."

The parable of the talents arose during discussion round the campfire at Gethsemane, just three days before Jesus was crucified. Thomas had inquired of Jesus:

"...what should be our attitude while you are away on the Father's business?" Jesus' reply included the parable of the talents, and this comment: "Truth is living; the Spirit of Truth is ever leading the children of light into new realms of spiritual reality and divine service. You are not given truth to crystallize into settled, safe, and honored forms. Your revelation of truth must be so enhanced by passing through your personal experience that new beauty and actual spiritual gains will be disclosed to all who behold your spiritual fruits and in consequence thereof are led to glorify the Father who is in heaven.

"What a sorry sight for successive generations of the professed followers of Jesus to say, regarding their stewardship of divine truth: 'Here, Master, is the truth you committed to us a hundred or a thousand years ago. We have lost nothing; we have faithfully preserved all you gave us; we have allowed no changes to be made in that which you taught us; here is the truth you gave us.'

"But such a plea concerning spiritual indolence will not justify the barren steward of truth in the presence of the Master. In accordance with the truth committed to your hands will the Master of truth require a reckoning." (1918)

Now, if the steward with the one talent had taken the others to court for actually doing something with what had been entrusted to them, what would have been his master's response? Would he have given this unprofitable servant a  commendation?

Everybody who thinks in terms of "spreading the message" by handing out the complete and inviolate text of the Urantia Papers must surely have missed reading the comments accompanying the parable of the talents. And not only this but other comments from the revelators confirm that we are not meant to crystallize the truths provided to us. "Static truth is dead truth," we are told, "and only dead truth can be held as a theory. Living truth is dynamic and can enjoy only an experiential existence in the human mind." Then there is the exhortation on p. 43:

"The religious challenge of this age is to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy of living..." What is then stated can hardly be construed in any other way than we are to take what the revelators have provided and recast it in forms suitable for all the peoples of this blighted planet. Surely food for thought?

# The Origin of Life on Urantia

A story of convergence.

Ken Glasziou

The description in the Urantia Papers telling how, 550 million years ago, the Life Carriers brought life to this planet causes problems for many readers, both new and old, who come across statements from scientific sources stating that life has been on this planet for in excess of 3 billion years.

In this article I have attempted to throw light on the various possibilities for reconciling the information in the Urantia Papers and the evidence now being pieced together by our scientists, and to show how the findings of science have increasingly converged with what is stated in the Papers.

To make sense of the Urantia Papers' presentation, several things are essential. One is appreciation of the different aims and purposes of the scientist and the revelators. In Section 5 of Paper 101, the revelators state, "Science deals with facts; religion is concerned only with values." We need to remember that factual truths of a materialistic nature that are so important to science and for history, nevertheless have little or no spiritual value.

A major concern of the authors of the Urantia Papers appears to have been to provide us with a synthesis of "the apparently divergent sciences of nature and the theology of religion into a consistent and logical universe philosophy." (1105) The authors had to do this within the bounds of restrictions imposed by the rules on revelation. These are covered in Section 4 of Paper 101, and need to be read with a critical and unbiased mind. One such restriction proscribes impartation of unearned or premature knowledge, but this is a restriction that is qualified by permission being given to the authors to impart key information when considered essential.

In providing us with a revelation that will achieve its purposes, the revelators were required to balance themselves on a knife edge, with the balance point adjusted, not in the direction of scientific fact, but on universe values. Wherever there was conflict, they give "value," not "fact," the priority. And, except in special circumstances, the science component had to remain anchored at the level of knowledge available to us humans prior to the mid-1930's.

The story in the Urantia Papers of the origin of life is a mixture of both science and history, intermingled so as to contribute to the "universe frame" in which we think1. ["Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a universe frame in which to think." (1260)]

This story is meant to endow us with a concept of how and why we came to be on this planet. It is not meant to be a collection of scientific "facts" by which lay people might impress others with their accurate advance knowledge of planetary history, nor is it meant to be an infallible science text for correcting the errors that scientists may make in their search for truth.

As with other stories in the Papers, the story of life's origins is there to help each of us to formulate our own personal "universe frame." My guess is that our "frame" will remain personal—and erroneous to some degree— even up to the time we attain Paradise. Thus the expectation that an infallible "universe frame" has been provided by the revelators in the Urantia Papers would be unrealistic. Now to the story itself.

The Papers tell us that 550 million years ago, the Life Carriers returned to Urantia to initiate the original life patterns of this world and to implant them in the hospitable waters of the realm. (667) A requirement was that this life plasm would contain "the full potential for all future developmental variations and for all subsequent evolutionary changes and modifications." (398)

That this "full potential for all future developments" was present in primitive life forms was totally in contrast to long-held human concepts about evolution, both at the time the Papers were received (mid-1930's) and right up until quite recently. These concepts were forced to change when the reality of the so-called "Cambrian explosion" of 540 million years ago was recognized.

This change in scientific opinion appears to have been catalysed by a re-interpretation of the evidence contained in the remarkable fossil deposits of the Burgess shales in western Canada. One description of the Cambrian explosion states: "In a burst of creativity like nothing before or since, nature appears to have sketched out the blueprints for virtually the whole of the animal kingdom."

In actuality, the concept that evolution was entirely from the very simple, and then, step by step to the complex was already in trouble, even before the discovery of the "Cambrian explosion." Geneticists studying mutations in fruit flies had found that genes that control morphogenesis, particularly of limbs, consisted of a bundle of associated genes that together were given the name "homeobox." DNA experiments with these genes showed that the same kind of controlling homeobox was already present in a range of invertebrates, including even worms, and was also present in higher animals such as the frog. Hence this finding that the system that controls limb development in a frog was also present in worms, was exactly what would be expected if the Urantia Book statement was correct—which is that the life plasm introduced by the Life Carriers already had the full potential for all subsequent development.

This period of changing opinion among geologists was also accompanied by re-assessment of concepts about the first appearance of multicellular organisms. Previously, many believed this to have been in excess of one or even two billion years ago. It is now placed in the region immediately preceding the Cambrian explosion, somewhere between 540 and 560 million years before the present—and consistent with the book's statement about the qualities of the introduced life plasm.

However, the outstanding problem is the strong evidence for primitive life being present on this planet billions of years ago It remains in need of explanation.

Part of the evidence for the presence of life on Earth so long ago is those unique structures called "stromatolites" that are preserved in fossilized limestone, 3.5 billion years old, at several locations. These structures can still be seen forming in favorable shallow inter-tidal zones and are invariably associated with the activities of  photosynthetic cyanobacteria (also known as blue-green algae). Hence it is assumed that the ancient stromatolites were also the result of activities of photosynthetic bacteria. (see Figures 1 and 2)

More evidence for the occurrence of ancient life forms comes from the deposition of certain kinds of sedimentary red sandstone deposits, the red coloration being due to a coating of the sand grains with fully oxidized iron. This process is thought to have been due to the water soluble ferrous form of iron in the seas being used as a recipient for the oxygen formed during photosynthesis by various life forms. The product, the red ferric iron, was insoluble and was deposited on the sand grains. This kind of deposit dates as far back as 2.5 billion years ago.

In later years the deposition of red sedimentary rocks in which the color is due to the ferric form of iron occurred when the oxygen content of the atmosphere rose to levels sufficiently high to trigger oxidation of soluble ferrous iron and the deposition of the insoluble ferric form

The only known process to bring about such high levels of atmospheric oxygen is photosynthesis by living organisms. Many, possibly all, of these deposits date from times prior to 550 million years ago, and again present evidence for the occurrence of life forms that pre-date the introduction of life plasm by the Life Carriers. Further evidence comes from the occurrence of several kinds of microfossils thought to be evidence for bacterial or algal cells.

The Urantia Papers state, "Life does not originate spontaneously but is constructed...it appears on the inhabited worlds either by direct importation or as a result of the operation of the Life Carriers." (396)

That statement rules out the possibility that some primitive life forms, originating from other inhabited planets, are able to survive in outer space, and, after floating around among the galaxies, they seed new planets when conditions become favorable.

Taken together, the evidence is strong that primitive life forms were present on our planet prior to the introductions made by the Life Carriers 550 million years ago. A possible explanation is that the revelators define what constitutes "life" differently from ourselves. That this maybe so is evidenced by their statement that:

"The material self, the ego entity of human identity, is dependent during the physical life on the continuing function of the material life vehicle, on the continued existence of the unbalanced equilibrium of energies and intellect which, on Urantia, has been given the name life." (1229)

This statement may imply that the inherent potential to attain "intellect" is definitive of what, for them, constitutes "life." By this definition, the forms of organism that preceded the Life Carriers' introductions, can be thought of as "pre-life" forms that were introduced to help prepare the environment, and particularly the atmosphere of our planet, for the implantations that came later. Such a view is consistent with the following statements:

"Life Carriers often carry actual life plasm to a new world, but not always. They sometimes organize the life patterns after arriving...in accordance with formulas previously approved...Such was the origin of the planetary life of Urantia." (399) And "We brought no life to Urantia. Urantia life is unique, original with the planet. This sphere is a life-modification world; all life appearing hereon was formulated right here on the planet." (667)

Components of these "pre-life forms" may also have been used by the Life Carriers for their in situ  synthesis of the life plasm that had the "full potential for all future developmental variations."

Other hypotheses are possible. The one presented is consistent with most of the current concepts in science and also with most of the statements in the Papers. However, it would be premature to attempt too much, as there is still an enormous amount to be learned about the genetics and structure of the lower life forms. Some of the required information is now coming from new technologies such as the base sequence analysis for 16S-ribosomal RNA.
Why did the revelators leave us with these strange inconsistencies? Without them, their description of the introduction of life plasm 550 million years ago would appear to gel perfectly with the concept of the "Cambrian explosion," its dating at 540 million years before the present, and the preceding emergence of multicellular organisms. Probably many of us would then have used this prophetic information as proof positive for us to assert that the Urantia Papers are a revelation having celestial sources. The probable occurrence  of  "pre-life" organisms prejudices the validity  of that assertion.

My personal view, detailed in Innerface International Vol.5 No.7, is that such prophetic material borders on the miraculous to the point that our free will becomes imperiled in a way that is contrary to universe policy—which is the same kind of reason for which Jesus spurned the use of the miraculous to draw attention to himself and his teachings.

# Cosmic Reflections. Oops!!!

Dick Bain

The astronomy and cosmology of The Urantia Book has been a problem for many of us who care about this field of knowledge. We find it difficult to harmonize the descriptions and numbers in The Urantia Book with the current concepts of our astronomers.  One of my recent attempts to do so in an Innerface article [1] has a serious flaw caused by a simple math error, as well as some typos.

In the article, "Visible Universe," I thought I proved that all the galaxies our astronomers can see using the latest generation of telescopes would fit in the first outer space level described in The Urantia Book.  Sad to say, they won't. The eagle-eyed Norm DuVal spotted several typos in the article. When I checked over the article, I noticed the flawed calculation. Now let me set the record straight.

First, the typos: On page 12, column 2, "500 light years in diameter" should be "500 thousand light years in diameter;" "Milky Way galaxy at 100 light years diameter" should be "Milky Way galaxy at 100 thousand light years diameter." On page 13, first column, "Even if the average spacing between galaxies were 100 l.y" should be "Even if the average spacing between galaxies were 100 million l.y."  And next come the math problems.

For purposes of calculation, I chose a cube five million light years on a side to contain each galaxy.  This would space galaxies at an average distance of five million light years apart. The spacing may be closer in galactic clusters, but there is a good deal of nearly empty space between clusters, so I think my proposed volume per galaxy is reasonable, perhaps even on the small side.  In the article, my calculation of the volume of this space was given as 125 million cubic light years, which of course really should be 125 quadrillion cubic light years or 125 x 1018. This is  125 followed by 18 zeros.  If you divide this into the volume I calculated for the first OSL, 327 x 1021, you get a capacity of 2616 galaxies for the first OSL. The authors indicate that the stars we see are all in the first OSL, yet they say we will one day observe 375 million galaxies through better telescopes.  And based on the number of galaxies seen on a 1996 deep probe by the Hubble Space Telescope, some astronomers think there may be as many as 50 billion galaxies in the visible universe. The difference between 2616 and 50 billion galaxies is such a disparity that it is mind boggling! 

After noting my mistake, I had thought to invoke the 2nd OSL as a candidate for all the galaxies. My calculations show that it has a volume of 327 x 1027 cubic light years, and could hold 2.6 x 109 (2.6 billion) galaxies. Unfortunately, the authors seem to indicate that all the visible galaxies are in the first outer space level. Now if the astronomers estimate of 50 billion galaxies in the universe is in the ballpark, then we're really short of space. This many galaxies would require a volume of 6.25 x 1030 cubic light years. If we use the astronomers best guess for the size of the universe, which is about 12 billion light years in radius, then the volume of that sphere (Vs=4 x PI x r3) is 1.7330 cubic light years.  Oops, the astronomers' universe isn't large enough to hold all of its galaxies!  Of course, if we reduce the number of galaxies to 10 billion or reduce the space per galaxy, we can squeeze them into the Big Bang universe.

Another item that affects our picture of the universe is the concept of red shift. All the determinations of distances greater than about 100 million light years depend mainly on the red shift of the light from these distant galaxies. The Urantia Book authors tell us that most of the red shift is due to the passage of light through space and not to "the speed of recession" of the galaxies away from us. In either case, since the amount of red shift is proportional to the distance of the galaxy from us, then the more distant galaxies have the greatest red shift. The effect is the same whether the red shift is due to speed of recession or the effect of space on light passing through it.  Unfortunately, we don't have a way to calibrate distance if we throw out the Hubble formula for distance based on the amount of red shift due to speed of recession.

However we gauge the size of the universe, it must be large enough to contain all of the visible galaxies.  There needs to be adequate space between neighboring galaxies or they will mutually disrupt each other. Of course, there are some collisions between galaxies and consequent merging on a cosmic time scale, but most of the galaxies we see seem not to be in the process of being disrupted by neighboring galaxies. While I doubt that we will ever have an accurate count of all the galaxies, if the astronomers estimates are reasonable, then we need a universe with at least a 12 billion light year radius to house them all.

I don't see any way we can reconcile a universe containing billions of stars with a volume as small as the first outer space level.  If the universe doesn't look like the picture in The Urantia Book, then what does it look like?  What were the authors trying to tell us when they painted a universe that appears too small?  Is the shape of The Urantia Book universe correct, but the size is not?  Or are both inaccurate?    The astronomers are attempting to map the universe and plot its structure.  In a few years or a few decades, we may have a clearer picture of the structure of the visible universe.  Perhaps then we will have a clearer picture of what the authors were trying to tell us.

Corrections

In this article, the fifth paragraph of the section "Maximum and Minimum Size of the Observable Universe" should read: "If the radius of the visible universe contracts by 25.5 million light years from its present size, it seems logical to assume that it also expands by an equal amount with reference to its present size of 51 million light years."

Additions

The same article used the information in The Urantia Book that indicates that the distance to the outer edge of the first outer space level is 50 million light years. The article also assumed that all the visible galaxies fit in the volume of the first outer space level.  Based on the corrections proposed for the "Visible Universe" article, the "Brahma Breathed" article also needs some revisions. If the billions of galaxies require a universe with a radius of 12 billion light years to house them, and space respiration takes two billion years to complete one cycle, then we should be able to see the evidence of five previous cycles. What will this evidence look like?

When the universe is in the expansion phase of the space respiration cycle, the light from other galaxies will be red shifted since they are moving away from us. When the universe is in the contraction phase, the galaxies are moving toward us, and the light from them will be shifted toward the blue end of the spectrum. However, since all the light reaching us is red shifted just by passing through space according to the authors of The Urantia Book, the light reaching us from galaxies in various parts of the space respiration cycle will appear as more or less red shifted rather than as alternating red and blue shifts. This means that the galaxies less red shifted will appear closer to us than they are if we only consider red shift.  And galaxies with extra red shift will appear further away than they really are. This will make the universe look as though it is composed of concentric spheres of lesser density of galaxies alternating with concentric spheres of greater density of galaxies. If such a structure emerges as the astronomers map the universe, we will have some validation of the idea of space respiration. Providing of course that the universe actually is 12 billion light years in diameter and that the amount of red or blue shift due to space respiration is significant enough to detect. Otherwise, we shall still be in the dark.  As usual.

# The Red Shift Shifted

"Although your spectroscopic estimations of  astronomic velocities are fairly reliable when applied to the starry realms belonging to your superuniverse and its associate superuniverses, such reckonings with reference to the realms of outer space are wholly unreliable. Spectral lines are displaced from the normal towards the violet by an approaching star; likewise these lines are displaced towards the red by a receding star. Many influences interpose to make it appear that the recessional velocity of the external universes increases at the rate of more than one hundred miles a second for every million light-years increase in distance. By this method of reckoning, subsequent to the perfection of more powerful telescopes, it will appear that these far-distant systems are in flight from this part of the universe at the unbelievable rate of more than thirty thousand miles a second. But this apparent speed of recession is not real; it results from numerous factors of error embracing angles of observation and other time-space distortions." (134)

The supposed recessional velocities of many red-shifted celestial bodies have now increased sixfold more than the Urantia Papers' prediction, to almost  the speed of light. Such velocities are calculated on the assumption that the red shift is solely due to recessional velocity. And by making this assumption, plus correcting  apparent brightness for the red shift-based distance from us, objects such as high red shift quasars, apparently no larger than our solar system, come out as being brighter than thousands, and even millions of galaxies. Surely such an evidence-based finding should warn us that something may be wrong with the basic premises.

Unfortunately, if it is wrong then the structure of the widely-accepted Big Bang theory of universe origins is in jeopardy—for the original premise came from Hubble's 1929 conclusion, based on his observations with the new 100-inch telescope at Mt. Wilson, that all galaxies within its range were receding with a speed that increases with distance.

Among Hubble's early observations were his re-assessment of the nature of what were known as "white nebulae." He concluded that these were extra-galactic—that is outside of the Milky Way. He then showed that their red shift increased as the white nebula became fainter, from which he concluded the universe must be expanding.

It was immediately obvious that by calculating backwards from the recessional velocity of an expanding universe, one could estimate a point in time when that universe began.  Hubble's original estimate was 500 million years ago. It became 2 billion years by the 1950's, 5 to 10 billion years by the 1960's, and now the average estimate is probably about 15 billion years.

How could all the matter in the universe originate from a tiny bubble in space? Einstein's e = mc2 indicated that matter could be derived from energy, Boltzmann had shown that a doubling of temperature will give a sixteen-fold increase in energy, and laboratory experiments had shown that a photon of light at sufficiently high energy can create an electron-positron pair. Couple that kind of evidence with an admission that the laws of physics, as we know them, must break down under the proposed conditions of temperature and energy density for the Big Bang, and low and behold, we have a situation where anything is possible. And so the Big Bang was born in about 1947 to become an almost fanatically-backed established concept on how we came to be.

But not all agree. For some, the many patches required to make a Big Bang model appear to work in computer modeling theories have spoiled the picture. And even with the patches, there remain observations like the quasar story that simply have no explanation in Big Bang theory. Early protesters were many plasma physicists who soon discovered how difficult it would be to present their objections.

One of the alternatives to account for the peculiarities of quasars simply says that they are not far distant objects but that most are actually in our local system of galaxies.

This hypothesis requires the rejection of the concept that the red shift is solely due to the recessional velocity of a celestial body. In doing so it raises serious questions for the Big Bang hypothesis of universe origins. A reason for this challenge was the observation that maps of galaxies made from data obtained from radio telescopes often show two lobes of radio frequency radiation situated at right angles to the axis of disk-shaped galaxies and immediately adjacent to their center. (see Figure 3) Jets from the galaxy center were often observed to pass through the lobes. Some times it was noticed that pairs of quasars were  located at exactly the same place as the two lobes of radio frequency radiation. For many years it had been concluded that the radio frequency lobes provided evidence that matter was being ejected from the galaxies. So why should it not be that the quasars were evidence for the same thing.?

The answer by the Big Bang proponents was that the quasars are actually in the far distant background way beyond the galaxy, so it is mere coincidence that they appear to be located in the same area as the radio frequency lobes. Further evidence showed that this kind of combination of galaxy, radio frequency or X-ray lobes and quasars was common in Seyfert galaxies—galaxies  which have a highly active center. (see Figures 4 and 5)  In reply, those who favored the concept of quasars being local used statistical probabilities to indicate that it was highly unlikely that these associations were coincidental. Further observation showed that there are many cases where the association of galaxy, radiofrequency lobes, x-ray emitting objects, quasars and small galaxies is arranged in such a manner as to indicate that we are witness to the creation of new companion galaxies. One possibility is that our Milky Way galaxy is actually the offspring of the giant  Andromeda galaxy.

In support of the interpretation that quasars are local objects, it is proposed that at least part of the red shift of quasars, and like objects, is an indicator of their age rather than of their recessional velocity. The measurement of the red shift for some galaxies, plus their associated quasars and small companion galaxies is also claimed as evidence that their geometrical arrangement is in accord with what would be expected if the jets often seen being emitted from and at right angles to the plane through their active center, is indicative of the path taken by newly created matter that subsequently becomes quasars and small galaxies. This claim assumes the red shift to be an indicator of the age since creation of the new matter.

Halton Arp, in his book Seeing Red (Apeiron Press, Montreal, 1998) provides accounts and pictures of much of the hard evidence for this interpretation of the meaning of the red shift. It differs from that given by the authors of the Urantia Papers in that Arp attributes all of the red shift not accounted for by Doppler effects (i.e. the recessional velocity) to one cause whereas the Urantia paper nominates a number of causes. Age is not one of these, but we need to remember that the authors of the Papers state explicitly in their discussion of the mandate for revelation that they are not in the business of providing us with unearned knowledge—although they are permitted to divulge key information.

To this point our discussion has revolved around the evidence about the red shift rather than its interpretation. The principal evidence in favor of the red shift being intrinsic rather than due to recessional velocity is the often-encountered association of radio frequency and X-ray lobes of active galaxies with the occurrence of matching quasars and the results of statistical analysis of the probability of that association—plus the geometrical arrangements of these components and their correspondence with the jets radiating directly from a galactic center. Also in its favor is that the nearby location afforded to quasars does away with the otherwise incredible outpouring of radiant energy that must be attributed to quasars if their actual distance from us is calculated from a red shift attributed to recessional velocity.

Arp postulates that intrinsic red shift is a measure of the age of matter. This comes about because at the moment of an object's creation, he attributes it with  zero mass.

Mass, Arp says , is Machian. Ernest Mach earned some of his well deserved fame through his postulate that every particle in the universe derives its inertia from the rest of the particles in the universe.

Taking a newly created electron as an example, it would commence its life with zero mass because it has no "knowledge" of any other particle in the universe. Associated with the electron is a wave which is sent out in all directions and provides information to its source. Operating at the speed of light this "knowledge collecting agency" enables the electron to accumulate mass. Mass then is a variable, dependent on its time since creation. However the rate of change would be minuscule and not directly observable by short-lived creatures such as ourselves.

Bizarre as it might appear to be to the unitiated, the concept would not be bizarre to quantum physicists who have become accustomed to bizarre concepts that are now firmly based upon empirical evidence. For example, when one of a pair  of correlated photons is observed, it communicates change to its partner instantaneously, regardless of the distance by which the pair are separated.

How a particle actually gets its mass remains a mystery. Many believe a hypothetical "Higgs particle" is somehow responsible, but even if the existence of the Higgs is eventually confirmed, just how it confers mass may still remain a mystery.

The concept of an "information" wave is not new. Something similar was proposed by quantum physicist, David Bohm, and received much support. However Bohm did not connect his wave with the creation of mass. And can we really assert that Arp's proposal is any more bizarre than that a Big Bang was the means by which a spontaneous explosion created all from nothingness?

Of interest is the fact that the authors of the Urantia Paper have taken, for them, the unusual step of simply stating that our human interpretation of the cause of the red shift is wrong. In relatively few instances have they taken such a step.
