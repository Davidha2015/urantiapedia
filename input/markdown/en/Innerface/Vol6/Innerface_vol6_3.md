# Jesus' Concept of the Kingdom

"The Master made it clear that the kingdom of heaven must begin with, and be centered in, the dual concept of the truth of the fatherhood of God and the correlated fact of the brotherhood of man. The acceptance of such a teaching, Jesus declared, would liberate man from the age-long bondage of animal fear and at the same time enrich human living with the following endowments of the new life of spiritual liberty:

"1. The possession of new courage and augmented spiritual power. The gospel of the kingdom was to set man free and inspire him to dare to hope for eternal life.

"2. The gospel carried a message of new confidence and true consolation for all men, even for the poor.

"3. It was in itself a new standard of moral values, a new ethical yardstick wherewith to measure human conduct. It portrayed the ideal of a resultant new order of human society.

"4. It taught the pre-eminence of the spiritual compared with the material; it glorified spiritual realities and exalted superhuman ideals.

"5. This new gospel held up spiritual attainment as the true goal of living. Human life received a new endowment of moral value and divine dignity.

"6. Jesus taught that eternal realities were the result (reward) of righteous earthly striving. Man's mortal sojourn on earth acquired new meanings consequent upon the recognition of a noble destiny.

"7. The new gospel affirmed that human salvation is the revelation of a far-reaching divine purpose to be fulfilled and realized in the future destiny of the endless service of the salvaged sons of God." (1859)

# A Kingdom Commentary

Our "Favorite Places" section stresses the new meaning that a  knowledge of our future destiny in God's heavenly kingdom can bring to the way we conceive that our earthly careers should unfold.

There are many references to the "kingdom" in the Urantia Papers—to the point that it may be possible to have a false view of the real meaning. In Paper 170, we find the comment that though Jesus, "may have presented numerous concepts of the kingdom in his public teachings...to his apostles he always taught the kingdom as embracing man's personal experience in relation to his fellows on earth and to the Father in heaven." And his last word to them was always, "The kingdom is within you."

To serious students of the Papers, these comments must direct attention to their relationship firstly to the indwelling spirit forces within and secondly, to the loving service of their fellows. For this latter task, the leading of Spirit of Truth needs to be sought:

"Love, unselfishness, must undergo a constant and living re-adaptive interpretation of relationships in accordance with the leading of the Spirit of Truth. Love must thereby grasp the ever-changing and enlarging concepts of the highest cosmic good of the individual who is loved. And then love goes on to strike this same attitude concerning all other individuals who could possibly be influenced by the growing and living relationship of one spirit-led mortal's love for other citizens of the universe." (1950)

Why do we need the leading of the Spirit of Truth for this task of service?  We are told: "Do not make the mistake of expecting to become strongly intellectually conscious of the outpoured Spirit of Truth. The spirit never creates a consciousness of himself, only a consciousness of Michael, the Son." (2061)

It is through the revelatory life of Michael as Jesus of Nazareth that we obtain some understanding of the "highest cosmic good" of those whom we are called to serve. However, there is no way that any human being could know what would constitute the "highest cosmic good" of another human being in any particular circumstance.

To take the guesswork out of love for our neighbor we need guidance. And because the communication channels we have with the available spirit guidance from within tends to have a high noise-to-signal ratio, our acquired knowledge of the life and teachings of Jesus can be of invaluable assistance in "knowing" how to respond when our love is needed.

Life "in the kingdom" is quite different from ordinary life. Even though the external appearance of a kingdom liver may not appear to have changed much, once a full commitment has been made, our lives can and do become truly centered upon the spirit forces within—to the point that these spirit forces take precedence in the forefront of our minds rather than simply being present in the background.

When this happens, we truly do become as Jesus would have us be, his spirit-centered disciples, serving "as we pass by."

However, we all need a "universe reference frame" in which to think and reason. (1260) To succeed as a kingdom-liver, it is imperative that we get our universe frame adjusted to the perspective of our future universe career.

Virtually nothing associated with what normally are the cherished attainments of our material existence goes forward with us into the next phase of our lives. Fame, success, fortune, the adoration (or envy) of our peers, our accumulated material possessions, nothing of a material nature, nor anything tainted with that egocentricity derived from our animal heritage, has any spiritual value. Not even the memory of them will survive.

If worldly attainment has taken center stage in our lives, and if we did have a guardian angel (which seems unlikely), then, if questioned about what we actually attained by living on this planet, that angel would be forced to reply, "nothing."

Our entry into the "kingdom" requires a total re-orientation of our lives towards a state in which becoming God-centered, learning to "take no anxious thought," living one day at a time, waiting upon the will of God, and simply serving "as we pass by" constitutes our unworried, unhurried daily existence.

Only then does the "your kingdom come, your will be done" petition of the Lord's prayer have real meaning. 'Tis food for meditation.

# Jesus, Master Teacher

By Dick Bain, USA

One of the tasks that many people in the Urantia community are faced with at one time or another is teaching an individual or a group about The Urantia Book. Sometimes we may feel inadequate to the task, but we have some excellent guidance available. Though Jesus lived in a culture that was very different from ours, and though we are not dual nature beings like Jesus, nevertheless we can learn from his teaching methods. Our culture may differ from his, but human nature is the same today as it was 2000 years ago. The teaching methods of Jesus should be just as effective today as they were when he walked the earth. We students of The Urantia Book have the privilege of possessing a detailed account of Jesus' life and teachings. I believe that we who aspire to be teachers can profit greatly from studying and attempting to use Jesus' teaching methods.

Jesus and the Individual

During his time as Ganid's tutor, Jesus had the best opportunity of his life to teach and minister to individuals. Here are some of the incidents recorded in The Urantia Book and some thoughts about them:

Jesus talked to Godiah, a Philistine interpreter. When Godiah asked Jesus about the story of Jonah and the whale, he asked whether or not the whale actually swallowed Jonah. (1429) Because Jesus sensed how important this story was to Godiah, he did not directly address his question. He taught some truths by using metaphors derived from things mentioned in the story. By answering Godiah in this way, Jesus did not take anything away from him; rather he gave something to him. If we wish to teach someone, we need to learn about that person's deeply held beliefs and respect these.

Jesus turned Anaxand's anger toward his supervisor into concern for the supervisor's soul. (1431) Jesus used the metaphor of a drowning man and suggested that Anaxand would not let a man drown, and in a similar fashion, his supervisor was "floundering in darkness" and needed to be rescued. Jesus turned attention away from Anaxand's plight and focused it on the plight of his supervisor. He turned Anaxand's focus from within to without. He also suggested a positive plan of action: that he and Anaxand go and talk to the supervisor. Can we likewise turn someone's anger into positive action by using Jesus' method?

Fortune was a downcast and isolated young man. (1437) Jesus attempted to make a direct approach to the mind and soul of Fortune without success. He then resorted to the subterfuge of asking the young man for directions to Phenix. After Jesus had drawn the young man out of his shell, he was able to make an appeal to his soul through his mind. Jesus was persistent and creative in reaching Fortune; he wasn't put off by the failure of his first attempt. By showing interest in people's lives, we may be able to draw them out so we can speak to their souls. And we need to be creative and persistent in our approach to the souls of our fellow mortals.

Jesus gave counsel to a wealthy Roman regarding how he should administer his wealth. (1462) Jesus did this only because the rich man specifically asked for this advice. We would be well advised to follow this example. Do we lecture our children or do we practice the art of listening to them? Do we give friends unwanted advice?

Ganid was surprised that Jesus did not try to speak about spiritual matters to a pagan they met. (1466) Jesus explained that the man was not seeking truth now, but that later he might be ready for it. At another time, Jesus said that we should not cast our pearls before swine. In other words, don't waste your time with those who don't care about what you have to offer, but also recognize that some of them may sometime in the future be hungry for truth. Sometimes we need to practice patience and wait for a sign of readiness before we try to introduce The Urantia Book or ideas from it to people. It may not be what they need at that particular moment.

When Jesus saw a man mistreating his wife, he approached him in a way that distracted him from his anger. (1471) Jesus then made him aware that he was violating his own highest principles. This is one of the occasions that Jesus used guilt to make someone aware that his or her actions were unacceptable, but he did it in a kindly way, according to The Urantia Book. Some may think that encouraging guilt is never acceptable, but when we have failed to live up to our moral standards, guilt is an appropriate feeling. But we should not stay locked in feelings of guilt; rather, we should take appropriate action to remedy the problem. In this case, the man regretted what he had done, and promised to live up to a pledge he had made to a Cynic priest. Jesus showed us how to intervene in a conflict situation, and how it can be effective if we do it in a loving fashion

When Jesus and Ganid were accosted by two prostitutes, Ganid tried to send them away, but Jesus had a different reaction; he treated them with sympathy and dignity. (1473) He recognized that they had been forced into their work by circumstances. But he did more than sympathize with the women; he arranged a way for them to escape from their situation. He brought them to the wife of a new friend, and this woman agreed to help them leave their life of degradation and help them find work. They were not given charity, but rather a chance for honest work, a chance to regain their self-respect. It was not so much what Jesus said, but what he did that was the most effective in this case. Actions speak louder than platitudes. Ganid learned several valuable lessons from this experience. Jesus taught Ganid to look beyond the surface appearances and see the goodness in the two women, and he saw that it is important sometimes to lend a helping hand as well as supportive words.

In Section 4 of Paper 133, Jesus speaks to a number of persons. (1474) In each case, he uses metaphors drawn from the sort of work each person is doing. We are usually more comfortable with and respond better to that which is familiar to us, that which is nearest and dearest to our hearts.

The forgoing examples show a number of principles that Jesus used in his work with individuals. Jesus understood human nature. He lovingly but firmly led people to consider their spiritual nature. He always appealed to love and fairness; he never stooped to use of fear or intimidation; the content of his teaching was always positive. He knew the ways in which we attempt to shut off truth that we don't want to hear and he knew how to circumvent these roadblocks.

Jesus with the Apostles

When Jesus taught the Apostles and disciples, he used different techniques than he did with individuals or large crowds. He sometimes simply lectured, but he also taught by example, and by actions whose results carried a lesson.

There are many of Jesus' lectures and talks with the Apostles recorded in The Urantia Book. Some of these lectures were initiated by Jesus to enlighten his Apostles, but many were spontaneously generated in response to a question by one of the Apostles. I am sure that few of us will have apostles or disciples, but we may unexpectedly find ourselves in a position of teaching a group of people. I believe we can use the spontaneous teaching method of Jesus to advantage.

On one momentous occasion, we observe Jesus teaching by example. When Jesus joined the Apostles in the upper room for the Last Supper, he found them contending for the seat of honor at Jesus' right hand; this was not the first time that the Apostles had been contending with one another about their place in the coming kingdom. Jesus gave them a profound lesson in humility; he washed their feet. He used this example to then give them a talk about service. By his actions, Jesus was able to make all of the Apostles very conscious of the pettiness of their contending for the place of honor. He opened their hearts and minds to the lesson on service he taught after his unexpected action. When I think of this lesson, I am reminded that our lives can be a lesson to everyone whose lives we touch in some way. We can teach by doing.

Jesus also set up situations to produce results that served as profound lessons to his Apostles. Consider the feeding of the 5000. Though Jesus had proclaimed time and again that his was a spiritual kingdom not of this world, yet the apostles had not completely given up the idea of Jesus as a Messiah who would take his place as leader of the Jews by demonstration of divine power. They saw the increasing number of people following after Jesus as a sign that he might soon be acclaimed a political as well as a spiritual leader of the Jews. It was indeed a painful lesson they received when they saw Jesus refuse the call to kingship and saw the material minded among the people following Jesus desert him.

Possibly one of the most amazing and powerful demonstrations Jesus performed was raising Lazarus from the dead. Apparently, Jesus did not raise Lazarus to teach or change anyone's mind, rather, this demonstration reinforced the faith of Lazarus' sisters, the Apostles and others who already believed in him and his mission. But reinforcing that which we know and believe is a part of teaching, much as when a teacher gives a child positive feedback for getting a math problem correct. Sometimes we forget that affirmation is a powerful tool. We forget to praise that which is praiseworthy to reinforce positive behavior. We forget that encouraging the positive is the best way to eliminate the negative.

Jesus Teaches the Crowds

Jesus' teaching methods with the crowds was different than his approach to teaching the Apostles. This is not surprising, since Jesus chose his Apostles to carry on his teachings. When Jesus taught them, he was teaching teachers.  When teaching the masses, Jesus was teaching a group of people with varying levels of spiritual hunger and comprehension, so different methods were appropriate. One of his favorite devices for teaching the crowds was the parable.

The authors of The Urantia Book inform us that there were a number of good reasons for Jesus to use parables when teaching the masses. First, he could teach at several levels at once. The more spiritual listeners could discern deeper spiritual meaning than those who were less spiritually inclined. And those who sought to trip Jesus up would be unable to derive any meaning from the parable because they were not spiritual seekers. Another reason parables are valuable when teaching truth is that stories are more easily remembered than lectures. This may be why the parables of Jesus survived in the Bible much better than anything else he said. We probably won't have to deal with hostile Pharisees, but perhaps parables might add an interesting twist when we are teaching a large group of people. The next day, they might even remember something we said!

# Cooking up a Universe

Ken Glasziou

Is designing a universe easy or hard? It transpires that to put together a universe like ours, there are about twenty parameters (numbers) that are critical for specifying the kind of universe we cook up. The value we choose for the force of gravity is one parameter. If we make it too strong, our stars will collapse to become black holes. If we make it too weak, they won't condense but will remain as a cloud of gas and dust. Another parameter is concerned with electric charge, how strong should we make the force of attraction between protons and electrons in atoms. Yet another determines how strong we make the force that holds the atomic nucleus together, and still another, how strong the cosmological constant should be, etc., etc. Designing an inhabitable universe introduces many more difficulties, so let's simply try for a universe having stars like ours.

Let's imagine God is seated before a bank of celestial computers having the twenty dials that tune the parameters for providing the required outcome. He starts with the most important—tuning the force of gravity. The control dial is set in terms of proton masses and must be tuned so that stars are formed of the right size and lifetime to eventually provide a stable universe. If the stars are too small, they will not ignite to burn their hydrogen fuel to helium, if they are too big they won't last long enough to be useful. Or they might collapse to a black hole.

After some tinkering, the computers throw up the number, 1x10-38 proton masses. That means one divided by 10 followed by 38 zeros. Now that's tiny. God punches a few keys and gets some answers—the expected life of an average star comes out as ten billion years, which is about what is needed. Dropping a zero reduces lifetime by 1000-fold, drop another zero and the star lasts only 10,000 years. God accepts the computer value.

The next important job is selecting a cosmological constant that will fix the mass-energy density of space. The computers say it must be set to no more than 10-40 proton masses. More tinkering and it is found that for any bigger value, the universe won't last long enough to produce stars. God again accepts the computer value.

God still has 18 parameters (values) to assign. While he does the work, let's find out what the chances are of getting our kind of stars in our kind of universe if we just spin those twenty tuning dials at random.

That's not a major problem for the celestial computers, and the answer comes in a fraction of a second as just one chance in 10229. That means one chance in 10 followed by 229 zeros!!! One chance in 10229 is so incredibly slight as to be beyond our wildest imagining—for all intents and purposes, impossible..

But a starry universe is only a beginning. For life to exist, the stars need to have planets and, among other things, inhabitable planets need to have an orbit giving a temperature range that permits permanent surface water to exist. Then an atmosphere, the right balance of chemicals, and thousands of other critical little things are essentials. Like the crucial need for an ultra-violet light filter at the top of the atmosphere. Or the right amount of oxygen in the atmosphere. A few percent increase and our forests and grasslands go up in an unstoppable blaze. Or if too much carbon dioxide, temperatures soar, and the ice cap melts.

And so, from what commenced as just a modest design project, we have begun to realize the enormous complexity of our self-appointed task—to the point of appreciating that even the most highly skilled team of scientists ever assembled could not design our universe, let alone create it. In fact, starting from nothing, our team could not even serve up its own breakfast. Which leads us to a question: if an all-knowing, all-powerful God did not create our universe, then who or what did???

P.S. Did you know?? If a soup composed of the nucleotide ingredients (building blocks) for DNA is made to polymerize at random, the chances of forming a single functional gene averages about 1 in 10150. That number is far, far higher than the total number of stars in the whole of the visible universe. And all higher animals require thousands of functional genes!!! Boggles the mind does it not? I wonder what mind really is?

# An Alternative View of Jesus' Incarnation.

[This article appeared in a church newsletter, author unnamed and no copyright. If something similar went into other church publications it may help prepare the way for the Urantia Book's message.]

Several members of our congregation have asked for more information about my comment in the parish newsletter that said, "semi-dormant underneath the surface of our religion, there is a beautiful alternative that keeps peeking through."

One way to discover this alternative is by asking ourselves what our religion might be like if our Bible consisted in only the four Gospels and was without extraneous background information into which the meaning of Jesus and his teachings had to be made to fit.

Confronted with this task, one of those Bibles having Jesus' spoken word printed in red ink is a great help. My first act would be to familiarize myself with Jesus' spoken word to the point that I would know most of it by heart. In fact something similar to this did happen to me, for which I am eternally grateful. Stripped from the ideas and theories of others, the more I learned of Jesus from his word and life, the more impressed I became with his utter uniqueness.

Here was a man who spoke and thought entirely differently from ordinary humans. He is reported as saying, "He who has seen me has seen the Father." We are told he used the Aramaic word, "Abba" which, in English usage, is closer to "Papa" than to "Father." The Jews of Jesus' time were not permitted to even to say the word "Yahweh," their name for God. But here was a man who not only spoke freely about the Father but also spoke to God in the familiar vernacular of a child-parent relationship.

It took me a long time before I saw the links between Jesus, his child-parent relationship with God, and the parable in which he says, "Would any of you who are fathers give your son a stone when he asks for bread? Or would you give him a snake when he asks for a fish? As bad as you are, you will know how to give good things to your children. How much more then will your heavenly Father give good things to those who ask him."

Eventually it struck me that Jesus, whose life and teachings I already believed were a revelation of the nature of the God, in this parable was giving me a way to discover for myself  what the Father might think or do, or what his will might be, in particular circumstances. All I had to do was ask myself how I thought the best of all conceivable earthly fathers might react, and know that whatever I came up with would still be far short of the love, mercy, and wisdom that my heavenly Father would show.

I suppose the most important personal thing coming from my journey of discovery via the gospels was my rediscovery of  "God-within." This concept received little mention during the many years of my relationship with the church prior to my journey with the gospels. I found what I needed in John: "And I will ask the Father, and he will send you another Helper to continue with you forever—the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot accept, because it neither sees him nor knows him. You will know him, however, for he will remain with you, and will be in you." (14:16,17.), and  "Whoever loves me will retain my message. My Father will love him and my Father and I will come to him and make our abode with him." Luke adds the comment "...for the kingdom of God is within you." (17:21).

And so my awakening—you and I are indwelt by the spirits of the Father and the Son, you and I are children of the Father, hence we are brothers and sisters from one family, and we all can have an individual, personal, and continuous relationship with the indwelling spirits of God and Jesus to guide our lives and our thinking. Surely that is liberation.

Paul made it clear that in fostering such a relationship we are liberated from the "Law." For me that means that morality and ethics, right and wrong are no longer definable in legalistic terms. From my reading of the gospels, particularly parts like the sermon on the Mount from Matthew and from the parables, I can learn what Jesus meant by love, unselfishness, humility, and service, not as rules but  rather as principles. Then I must rely on the spirit forces within me to translate principle into practice.  My old religion was dominated by law, guilt, sin, and sacrifice—a life of penance and self-sacrifice. My new religion is dominated by love, spirituality, the simple joy of service (which is its own reward), and the desire to strip away all lingering traces of selfishness and self-assertiveness.

Since undertaking my adventure with the gospels I have also learned that my religion has no elements of exclusivity. All men and women everywhere are my brothers and sisters in one family of God. For me, this is true whether they follow Buddhism, Islam, or are Hindu, Christian, any other, or even of no religion. After all, why else did Jesus recount the story of the good Samaritan? And what about theology? I don't need it.

"Jesus advocated that we devote our lives to proving that love is the greatest thing in the world."

# The Urantia Papers on loving our Neighbor.

What constitutes loving our neighbor? And how do we go about actually doing it?

We learn about this concept from an elaboration in the Papers of the role of the new teacher, the Spirit of Truth, that Jesus stated he would send after he had "gone away." This was in response to a question from Judas Alpheus. In his reply Jesus had stated:

"This new teacher is the Spirit of Truth who will live with each one of you, in your hearts, and so will all the children of light be made one and be drawn toward one another. And in this very manner will my Father and I be able to live in the souls of each one of you and also in the hearts of all other men who love us and make that love real in their experiences by loving one another, even as I am now loving you." (1950)

There follows a discourse on the meaning of the "golden rule" that requires us to love our neighbor as we love ourselves. Included is this statement:

"The true cosmic meaning of this rule of universal relationship (the golden rule) is revealed only in its spiritual realization, in the interpretation of the law of conduct by the spirit of the Son to the spirit of the Father that indwells the soul of mortal man."

So how does the spirit of the Son interpret this law of conduct that demands that we love our neighbor?

"Love, unselfishness, must undergo a constant and living re-adaptive interpretation of relationships in accordance with the leading of the Spirit of Truth. Love must thereby grasp the ever-changing and enlarging concepts of the highest cosmic good of the individual who is loved."

Here we have a highly specific statement on how to love our neighbor. Our love must be in accord with the "highest cosmic good" of the one who is loved. That is, our love is not to confine itself to the immediate need of our neighbor but must take into consideration his/her eternal universe career.

The true meaning of "highest cosmic good" can readily be appreciated in situations in which parents satisfy the immediate needs of their children to the point of spoiling them—actions done in apparent love that could jeopardize the cosmic, universe careers of their offspring.

Loving our neighbor is such a complex requirement that none of us is capable of interpreting the true meaning of the term in particular instances—which is why we are instructed to interpret our love in accord with the leading of the indwelling Spirit of Truth.

"And so must we clearly recognize that neither the golden rule nor the teaching of nonresistance can ever be properly understood as dogmas or precepts. They can only be comprehended by living them, by realizing their meanings in the living interpretation of the Spirit of Truth, who directs the loving contact of one human being with another." (1950)

Loving our neighbor is not something we can do on our own. We must learn to listen to the Spirit of Truth of Jesus who, through the Father-Spirit that dwells within us, so interprets our love of another that it actually is directed towards their "highest cosmic good."

# How Would You Label This Man?

Sydney Harris, R.I.P.

The census taker from Rome was sent to Galilee around A.D. 28. As  he entered the region, he came across a man sitting on a donkey. The man had long hair and a flowing beard; he wore an old tattered cloak, sandals and beads.

"Pardon me," the census taker said, "but I'm taking the census. Do you mind answering a few questions?"

"Not at all," said the man on the donkey. "I believe in rendering unto Caesar the things that are Caesar's."

"What is your job?" asked the census taker.

"I have no job," replied the man. "Consider the lillies of the field—they toil not, neither do the spin."

"What is your family?"

"I have no family," the man answered. "I have left my parents and my brothers and sisters and I live alone."

"What is your address?"

The man sighed, "Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have nests; but I have nowhere to lay my head."

"Humph," muttered the census taker to himself. "No job and no fixed abode. Now do you belong to any clubs or have social affiliations?"

"None," said the man. "For no man can serve two masters."
"Do you go to school?"

"Nay," replied the man, "for which of us by taking thought can add one cubit to his stature?"

"Do you have any visible means of support?"

The man shook his head. "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth and rust corrupt and thieves break through and steal," he answered.

"Have you registered for military service?"

"I resist not evil, but return good for evil," replied the man. "And whosoever shall smite me on the right cheek, I shall turn to him the other also."

"Who are your friends?"

"I go among publicans and sinners."

"What political party do you belong to?"

The man shrugged, "Only this—a new commandment I give you that you love one another."

The census taker scribbled on his sheet: "Hippie character, school dropout, no permanent address, no job, probable draft dodger and pacifist, alienated from family, no wife or children, no church affiliation, dubious associates among lowest elements in town."

"One more thing," asked the census taker, "What is your name?"

The bearded one smiled sadly. "Some call me the Son of Man." Both then left to go on their respective ways.

# The Remembrance Supper—its Significance.

The attitudes of many Urantia Book readers to the remembrance supper suffers from a preconditioning derived from the Christian church's association of the supper with their doctrine of forgiveness of sin through Jesus' sacrificial death. But the authors of the Urantia Papers, though fully aware of this difficulty, nevertheless place great emphasis on the symbolic significance of the last supper for all who would follow Jesus.

As Jesus handed the "cup of blessing" to his disciples he said, "Take this cup, all of you, and drink of it. This shall be the cup of my remembrance. This is the cup of the blessing of a new dispensation of grace and truth. This shall be to you the emblem of the bestowal and ministry of the divine Spirit of Truth." (1941)

The Master, we are told, was instituting this remembrance supper as a symbol of a new dispensation wherein the individual emerges from the bondage of ceremonialism and selfishness into the spiritual joy of the brotherhood and fellowship of the faith sons of the living God.

Then, having broken the bread and handed it around, the Master stated that this "bread of life" was representative of the "word of the Father as revealed in the Son."

The authors of the Papers take pains to stress the dangers of turning this symbolism into some precise, crystallized ceremonial form. But they also inform us that when it is partaken by those who are Son-believing and God-knowing that on all such occasions the Master is really present. Hence it cannot be other than important that we take them seriously.

"The remembrance supper is the believer's symbolic rendezvous with Michael. When you become thus spirit-conscious, the Son is actually present, and his spirit fraternizes with the indwelling fragment of his Father." (1942)

Said Jesus, "When you do these things, recall the life I have lived on earth...and rejoice that I am to continue to live on earth with you and to serve through you."

This Paper's author describes the inauguration of the symbolic supper as a mighty occasion that took place in the upper room of the home of a friend. There was nothing of sacred form or ceremonial consecration about either the supper or the venue.  Jesus concluded by giving us this new supper as a symbol of his bestowal life—the word of eternal truth, his love for us, and the outpouring of the Spirit of Truth.

It is well that we take notice of the repeated emphasis given to the importance of the Spirit of Truth. It comes to a head in Section 2 of the following Paper in which Jesus uses the symbolism of the vine and its branches.

"I am the true vine and my Father is the husbandman. I am the vine and you are the branches. And the Father requires of me only that you shall bear much fruit."

An imperative form of address is used in what follows. We are told that every branch that bears no fruit, the Father will take away, but every branch that bears fruit, the Father will cleanse that it may bear more fruit.

"You must abide in me and I in you," says Jesus, "the branch will die if it is separated from the vine."

That comment deserves our concentrated thought and reflection. It appears that Urantia Book readers are dead ducks if they ignore Jesus' word—see:

"If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead." (2054)

Perhaps it would be better never to have had these Papers than to ignore their content, for at least we could have then entered a plea of ignorance.

Jesus continues, "He who lives in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit of the spirit and experience the supreme joy of yielding this spiritual harvest." (1945)

Would it not be wonderful if the scene subsequently described could some day be reflected in the earthly lives of those privileged to possess the Urantia Papers such that observers would say:

"And when the world sees these fruit-bearing branches—my friends who love one another, even as I have loved them—all men will know that you are truly my disciples." (1945)

Jesus concludes, "As the Father has loved  me, so have I loved you. Live in my love even as I live in the Father's love. If you do as I have taught you, you shall abide in my love even as I have kept the Father's word and evermore abide in his love."

Properly used in group gatherings the remembrance supper could be of great help in cementing loving relationships. As well, it can remind individuals of the necessity to become spirit-conscious so that such symbolic occasions ensure the actual presence of Michael whose spirit (Spirit of Truth) is then enabled to fraternize with our own indwelling Father-fragment. (1942)

The Paper's author finishes the section with these words: "In fact, the branch exists only for, and can do nothing except, fruit bearing, yielding grapes. So does the true believer exist only for the purpose of bearing the fruits of the spirit: to love man as he himself has been loved by God—that we should love one another, even as Jesus has loved us." (1946)

The message of these final words from Jesus to those who would follow him could be summarized as: Get your  priorities in order. Know that you exist for one purpose only—to yield spiritual fruit. That is now the sole purpose of your very being.

Another reminder. Time is unidirectional. It runs in one direction only—out.

Are you among the "chosen?"

"You are in this world, but your lives are not to be world-like. I have chosen you out of the world to represent the spirit of another world even to this world from which you have been chosen." (1946)

You have the Urantia revelation. You take it seriously. So are you among the "chosen" and if so, what are your obligations? This is a question we all must consider. Jesus gave us this assurance:

"I will be with you and all other men who desire my presence wherever you may be, and with each of you at the same time." (1948)

It is of course Jesus' Spirit of Truth that is with us and indwells us, although that Spirit of Truth never makes us conscious of itself. Rather it makes us conscious of the presence of Jesus.

The Spirit of Truth is described as the new teacher, the conviction of truth, the consciousness and assurance of true meanings on real spirit levels. It is the spirit of living and growing truth, expanding, unfolding, and adaptive truth. If we live "in Jesus," it is the means by which we become convicted of truth, it lifts us out from the influence of our evolutionary animalistic behavior patterns to a higher and spiritualized level of meanings and values.

"This new teacher is the Spirit of Truth who will live with each one of you, in your hearts, and so will all the children of light be made one and be drawn toward one another. And in this very manner will my Father and I be able to live in the souls of each one of you and also in the hearts of all other men who love us and make that love real in their experiences by loving one another, even as I am now loving you." (1949)

Are we Urantians drawn towards each other as children of the light? Do the spirits of the Father and of Jesus fraternize in our hearts and souls so that we demonstrate the love of Jesus in our lives? Does the world look at us and say, "Look at those Urantians, how they love one another. Surely they must be Jesus' true disciples?"

"Truth is a spiritual reality value experienced only by spirit-endowed beings who function upon supermaterial levels of universe consciousness, and who, after the realization of truth, permit its spirit of activation to live and reign within their souls."

A new age really is dawning. It is time to "get activated." We Urantians have been called upon to do so. If we also fail, the banner of truth bearing will simply go elsewhere.

# The Universe is Friendly?

"Ganid, I have absolute confidence in my heavenly Father's overcare; I am consecrated to doing the will of my Father in heaven. I do not believe that real harm can befall me; I do not believe that my lifework can really be jeopardized by anything my enemies might wish to visit upon me, and surely we have no violence to fear from our friends. I am absolutely assured that the entire universe is friendly to me—this all-powerful truth I insist on believing with a wholehearted trust in spite of all appearances to the contrary."

"The universe is friendly"—what a strange concept! Is it not the experience of virtually all of us that the universe is universally hostile? Ask a farmer and he will recount stories of flood, fire, famine, and drought. Ask all those emergency services people who deal with the aftermath of earthquakes, tidal waves, hurricanes, twisters, and other quirks of an apparently hostile nature. Of course there is another side—those freak events were always there and we humans just happened to build our homes in their territory.

However, for most of us, the statement we read in the Urantia Paper that relates Jesus' experiences duting his tutorship period with the Indian boy, Ganid, and which  attributes to Jesus his stated insistence on believing the universe is friendly despite all appearances to the contrary—this surely is out of this world, contrary to all experience, and bordering upon the ridiculous.

But is it? We have minds. Their origin is the cosmic mind of the Eternal Spirit so not likely to be unfriendly. We experience the ministry of the Universe Mother Spirit via the Mind Spirits—again not likely to be unfriendly. We each have a unique personality, the gift of the Universal Father, we have the indwelling Father-spirit to council and guide us, we have the Spirit of Truth from Jesus, always ready to council us. So what is the source of the unfriendliness, the hostility, that we feel is the natural experience of all creatures that dwell on this planet?

First we can discount the "natural disasters" of nature. After all they are entirely impersonal. If they catch us out, it really was our own fault in having exposed ourselves unnecessarily or else it was just "one of those things"—a natural hazard but hardly unfriendly.

The unfriendliness we experience in life is dominantly generated within our own minds, some of it in response to real or imagined "unfriendliness" from others of our kind, but much of it due to acquired attitudes.

Our minds are dualistic in nature. They have those components that are of the divine nature but they also bear the stamp of our evolutionary origins. We have inherited behavior patterns that we hold in common with other herd animals—dominance behavior, territorialism, the flight or fight response to threat, self-preservation, and other instinctual activities.

Jesus, of course, knew all this. Until we digest the text of the Urantia Papers we are only guessing. There is no way for science to know that our minds have their origin in cosmic mind and that it comes to us with inherent properties. Nor is there any way that science could ever discover that we each have a unique personality pattern derived from the Universal Father that also has the capacity to activate inherent properties of cosmic mind. Likewise scientists may infer that we do or do not have free will but it is dubious that proof of either contention will ever be available.

The Urantia Papers remove enough of our ignorance to permit us to think as Jesus thought, for in this regard, he was wholly man. So having acquired this necessary knowledge from the Urantia Papers it becomes possible for any of us to appreciate how and why Jesus could look upon the universe as friendly despite all appearances to the contrary. The hostility we experience is in our own minds—as is the fear. If we see the universe as unfriendly, it will be so. If we see other humans as unfriendly, we virtually guarantee that is how our relationships will be.

To experience the friendly universe as Jesus experienced it we have to turn our minds over to his Spirit of Truth.

"The true cosmic meaning of this (golden) rule of universal relationship is revealed only in its spiritual realization, in the interpretation of the law of conduct by the spirit of the Son to the spirit of the Father that indwells the soul of mortal man.

"And when such spirit-led mortals realize the true meaning of this golden rule, they are filled to overflowing with the assurance of citizenship in a friendly universe, and their ideals of spirit reality are satisfied only when they love their fellows as Jesus loved us all, and that is the reality of the realization of the love of God."

Attitudes thus make all the difference. Jesus never perceived the apparent hostility of others as being truly unfriendly but rather as their being misinformed and misguided.

# A letter to the Editor. Communicating with our Indwelling God-Spirit

What follows is part of a letter to the editor from Le'Ruth Ward Tyau, a reader living in Hawaii who tried out the revelators' recommended method for  improving contact with our Thought Adjusters. The method was discussed in the January/February Innerface in an article entitled, "On Worship." Le'Ruth discovered a variation of the method that, for many, would probably be a great help. She wrote:

Last year about this time I took a class called "The Personal Journal Circle," taught by Dr. Abe Arkoff, Professor Emeritus, UHM Psychology Department. In the class Abe asked us to write our journal in an  "altered point of view," as by a third party observing  and discussing our day with us. We were to address the letters to ourselves. I had difficulty with the thought until I got the idea that I would write the letters as if my Divine Adjuster had written them!

I really got into that idea and found it so delightful. I was doing this journal all on the computer in a nice script and then cutting each page and gluing them into a nice journal about 7 x 9. I was addressing the letters to Dear Le'Ruth and wondered how I would sign them. The thought came to me to use the initials D.S. for Divine Spirit and besides, my husband's Chinese middle name was D.S. so it appealed to me. Then as I tried out different fonts for the D.S. suddenly there were the Greek symbols for DS!(dS)

I liked how it looked and not feeling comfortable about signing them "Divine Spirit" and thinking this was presumptuous, as you indicated in your talk, I decided on using  Greek symbols. I went next door to show my grandsons and I asked them if they knew about those symbols and they told me that they are used in mathematics to mean to change and to sum!

I was really excited about it then! This is from one of my letters:

"P.S. I know you intended my signature to be DS for Divine Spirit, but I had a surprise for you when I prompted you to see how the DS would look in other fonts. You happened on the Greek alphabet and you discovered Delta Sigma is my signature! Delta means 'change' and Sigma means 'sum', so you can see how perfect my name is because I am bringing about change to the sum of your mortal self to make you much more that you are now! You are a pilgrim in time who will discover Eternity through me!"

On the day that I shared what I was doing with the class, a comment by a classmate caused me to cease from writing those "Dear Le'Ruth" letters for a while and to add a page in the front of the Journal with explanation! I wrote about the assignment as I have shared above and then wrote:

"A class member, after hearing about what I had done, commented that I would be good at automatic writing and it shocked me, as I do not believe in automatic writing! Besides I never intended to uplift my thoughts to presume they were divine words to me and I didn't want any one to ever think I had done that! So I quit and for a time just wrote letters addressed to "Dear Journal," and signed by "Le'Ruth!" However, I have gone back to writing them from a third party viewpoint because it is so enjoyable to have a divine lover's response to my day! Having someone who loves you either commend you or correct you is a wonderful learning experience. So, I have gone back to that format but will place this note of explanation in the front of my journal to say that I have written all the letters and never have I done more than 'pretend' they are written by my Divine Spirit!"

I did go back to writing the letters from the Divine Spirit and it was such a rewarding experience. But I didn't realize the great spiritual value of the experience until I read your paper on Worship! Suddenly the light went on and I realized how great it was that I was developing a dialogue experience with my Divine Adjuster through those letters!

I already have my sharing in my worship, prayer and receptivity time which I have each morning, so this evening time of writing a commentary about my day is an excellent way to complete the circle of dialogue.

After the class ended and my journal was full I began using letters for my journal. Your article has changed that! I started on February 1st and wrote of the profound effect your Worship article had on me and quoted the paragraphs you wrote after you told of your son's desire for a "method." I just want you to know how they have had an important influence in my life. I quoted several paragraphs including these three choice ones in my journal:

"Even after reading this, I was still a bit slow on the uptake but eventually it sank in that the technique being recommended to us by the revelators was really intended to be a dialogue. We are supposed to be both ourselves and also to speak the part of our own Spirit, replying to ourselves exactly as if we were truly our indwelling God-spirit."

"To take the part of God in a conversation would appear to be somewhat presumptuous if it were not for the fact that it has the sanction of the revelators who recommend it. But to do so effectively it becomes essential that we already have a reasonably accurate idea of what God might say to us in any particular circumstance. How can we do this? The revelators inform us that: 'The nature of God can best be understood by the revelation of the Father 	
which Jesus unfolded in his manifold teachings and in his superb mortal life in the flesh.'"

" That comment leaves us without doubt that the best way for us to know how God might respond to us is to be thoroughly familiar with the life and teachings given to us by Jesus. Once we achieve this, in a dialogue in which we also take the part of our own Spirit, when an answer is required we simply need to ask ourselves, 'What do we think Jesus would
have done?'"

Well done, brother Ken! Then D.S. responded:

"Now you understand why writing this journal can help you grow spiritually! As you imagine what I would say to you about your day, you will begin to be more aware of how you should think about your activities while you are experiencing them. You will be more aware when you confirm your daily plans with me, just what the 'Father's Will' would be for your day. Now you have begun to let me have a voice again in your day, realize that it is never too late to be what you are supposed to be. Inward, Onward and Upward.

"Love Eternally, D.S. The Archivist of your Mind, The Architect of your Soul, The Artist of your Life."

I hope this will bring a smile to your face and you will feel rewarded in some way for your sharing. I call it an "enrichment service!" Thank you.

Your Sister in the GOOD NEWS.
