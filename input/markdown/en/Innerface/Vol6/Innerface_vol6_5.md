# Truth! What is Truth?

[The significance of the Urantia Papers cannot be properly appreciated except that the reader is familiar with the limitations both inherent to and imposed upon their authors. These quotations are provided to assist our readers in their endeavors for understanding]

"All finite knowledge and creature understanding are relative. Information and intelligence, gleaned from even high sources, is only relatively complete, locally accurate, and personally true.

"Physical facts are fairly uniform, but truth is a living and flexible factor in the philosophy of the universe. Evolving personalities are only partially wise and relatively true in their communications. They can be certain only as far as their personal experience extends. That which apparently may be wholly true in one place may be only relatively true in another segment of creation.

“Divine truth, final truth, is uniform and universal, but the story of things spiritual, as it is told by numerous individuals hailing from various spheres, may sometimes vary in  details owing to this relativity in the completeness of knowledge and in the repleteness of personal experience as well as in the length and extent of that experience.” (42)

"The Urantia Papers. The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. These papers differ from all previous revelations, for they are not the work of a single universe personality but a composite presentation by many beings. But no revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. All other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space.

“While such admissions as this may possibly detract from the immediate force and authority of all revelations, the time has arrived on Urantia when it is advisable to make such frank statements, even at the risk of weakening the future influence and authority of this, the most recent of the revelations of truth to the mortal races of Urantia.” (1008)

"Because your world is generally ignorant of origins, even of physical origins, it has appeared to be wise from time to time to provide instruction in cosmology. And always has this made trouble for the future. The laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge. Any cosmology presented as a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short time. Accordingly, future students of such a revelation are tempted to discard any element of genuine religious truth it may contain because they discover errors on the face of the associated cosmologies therein presented.

“Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors. We are not at liberty to anticipate the scientific discoveries of a thousand years. Revelators must act in accordance with the instructions which form a part of the revelation mandate. We see no way of overcoming this difficulty, either now or at any future time. We full well know that, while the historic facts and religious truths of this series of revelatory presentations will stand on the records of the ages to come, within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired. The cosmology of these revelations is not inspired. It is limited by our permission for the co-ordination and sorting of present-day knowledge. While divine or spiritual insight is a gift, human wisdom must evolve.” (1109)

"Partial, incomplete, and evolving intellects would be helpless in the master universe, would be unable to form the first rational thought pattern, were it not for the innate ability of all mind, high or low, to form a universe frame in which to think. If mind cannot fathom conclusions, if it cannot penetrate to true origins, then will such mind unfailingly postulate conclusions and invent origins that it may have a means of logical thought within the frame of these mind-created postulates. And while such universe frames for creature thought are indispensable to rational intellectual operations, they are, without exception, erroneous to a greater or lesser degree.

“Conceptual frames of the universe are only relatively true; they are serviceable scaffolding which must eventually give way before the expansions of enlarging cosmic comprehension. The understandings of truth, beauty, and goodness, morality, ethics, duty, love, divinity, origin, existence, purpose, destiny, time, space, even Deity, are only relatively true. God is much, much more than a Father, but the Father is man's highest concept of God; nonetheless, the Father-Son portrayal of Creator-creature relationship will be augmented by those supermortal conceptions of Deity which will be attained in Orvonton, in Havona, and on Paradise. Man must think in a mortal universe frame, but that does not mean that he cannot envision other and higher frames within which thought can take place.” (1260)

The purpose of revelation

“The fact of religion consists wholly in the religious experience of rational and average human beings. And this is the only sense in which religion can ever be regarded as scientific or even psychological. The proof that revelation is revelation is this same fact of human experience: the fact that revelation does synthesize the apparently divergent sciences of nature and the theology of religion into a consistent and logical universe philosophy, a coordinated and unbroken explanation of both science and religion, thus creating a harmony of mind and satisfaction of spirit which answers in human experience those questionings of the mortal mind which craves to know how the Infinite works out his will and plans in matter, with minds, and on spirit.” (1105)

# On Comprehending The Urantia Book

Author: **Ken Glasziou**

It would be quite strange if all readers interpreted our “Favorite Places” article in the same way. However, many who have considered the content of those passages have come to appreciate The Urantia Book in a new light—one in which the spiritual content of its text is viewed quite apart from those segments of the text that are more relevant to the secular world.

Having considered the restrictions that proscribe the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge, together with the individual limitations of the various authors, many readers see the secular content of the Papers as simply a background framework within which they can better comprehend the true meaning of their sojourn upon this planet. The requirement for this framework is not its absolute truth but its pragmatic adequacy to help the reader construct their own universe frame in which to reflect upon more important matters relevant to an eternal universe career.

Such readers are then free to determine for themselves how the spiritual components of the Papers should impinge upon their thought and their lives. For this purpose, an understanding of the help available from the Spirit of Truth (Paper 194, Sect. 2) in determining the relative truth content of any materials under consideration is indispensable.

What then is the intended role of the extraordinarily prophetic information also included in the text of the Papers?—information like the radius of the electron as discovered by Stefan Tallqvist that would have been quite impossible for any human to know at the time of the book's first publication.  (see later article “The Radius of the Electron.”)

It seems that the authors of the Papers were confronted with a “balancing on a knife edge” type of task. The Papers explain the value of our free will, “As pertains to eternal survival, God has decreed the sovereignty of the material and mortal will, and that decree is absolute.” (71)

It does not take excessive concentration to perceive how miraculous demonstrations of any kind may interfere with our free will to choose our own preferred way rather than what we might perceive to be God's way. Belief in miracles has coerced many a Christian to acquiesce to the Mosaic law against the desires of their own free will.

On the other side of the knife edge, the revelators needed to consider the urgent need of Urantian societies to free themselves from the shackles of a materialistic-deterministic philosophy that is now embedded in the universe frames for thinking of most people. This philosophy not only threatens to breakdown the basis of all morality among Urantians but also threatens to envelop us with the the possibility of widespread anarchy.

As in the days of Jesus' revelatory life, it appears that miraculous demonstrations of the power of God are not in accord with universe policy. And in accordance with that policy, it appears that the revelators have effectively excluded the possibility of a “divinely dictated” status being afforded to the Urantia Papers by the simple expedient of including sufficient material that could be classified as erroneous by those with the freewill desire to do so.

The revelators also had the difficult task that, while discouraging a “divine dictation” status from being conferred upon the Urantia Papers, they were still required to present them so as to attract the attention of dedicated seekers of truth.

Looked upon in this light, the revelators have  accomplished their assignment magnificently—to the point that they were even permitted to include this prophecy on the last page of their presentation:

“Be not discouraged. Human evolution is still in progress, and the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail.” (2097)

# On Free Will

Author: **Ann Bendall, Qld**

The only possible gift of true value to God is our free will. (22) God asks that we align our will to his. But we cannot give him our will or let him take over, which would be a delightfully simple process—if it were possible. Instead God asks that we become real to the universe by aligning our will to his, that is by striving to choose that which is godlike in each decision we make. And so—decisions, decisions, decisions and more decisions are required from us.

The most perfect example of “doing God's will” was the crucifixion. Jesus could have avoided such an ignominious death. He could have moved to Rome with the apostles, but in his heart he “knew” that this was not what God required of him.

Short term, such an action might have solved a problem, but in the long term it did a grave disservice to many for, until such time as his life on Urantia was completed:

His Spirit of Truth could not be released for the benefit of all on this and every other world of his creation.

Thought Adjusters could not come to every person capable of making a moral decision.

The resurrection of sleeping survivors could not occur.

How significant were these three? To God and the Son of God, paramount. But to the human Jesus, an immediate painful reality of his leaving this planet was his apprehension that his apostles were still unprepared.

And so, up until the night of his arrest, he continued to pray, “if this cup may not pass, then would I drink it. Not my will but yours be done.” And, as he prayed, his strength increased to face and accept God's will for him.

How powerful is our will?

Incredibly so! In The Urantia Book there are a number of classic exemplars of the power of the individual's will pitting itself against the universe, to the point of perpetrating sin and even perhaps iniquity:

1. Look at the Sanhedrin. It is inconceivable to me that intelligent and “religious” men, who knew that Jesus had raised Lazarus from the dead, in their vested self-interest, classified him as being in league with the devil. Did they really believe so?

To them he was walking a different pathway from themselves, and so was creating hell for them in his disrupting of their power base. I suspect that God had absolutely no relevance in the decisions they made, despite the fact that they were planning to kill a person who stated that he was the Son of God. Consequently, in their decision making process, in acknowledging that Jesus had superhuman power, and by deeming themselves to being devout servants of God, they could deduce that Jesus must have been a servant of the devil.

Perhaps some thought that they were doing God's will, but they defined this God's will as being the retention of the status quo of their religion. And they certainly did not go through the process of exploring what would have been a “godlike” decision.

But, for me, the incredible enigma was the abject vain gloriousness of the Sanhedrin. How could they believe they could kill a person who had power over life and death. Did they truly believe they could exterminate Jesus? Tragically, Jesus referred to some of them as iniquitous.

2. Then there was Judas. For years he had lived with Jesus. For years Jesus had taught him his philosophy of life and his beliefs. And Jesus lived what he taught. Yet Judas deemed him to be a coward!

Judas witnessed so many of the things that Jesus did, the miracles, the caring, the compassion. How could he not understand that Jesus was what he said he was—the Son of God. When Peter had declared him to be so, Judas had risen with the others in confirmation of what Peter had said. Yes, we appreciate that Judas had more than his share of failings but for him to want to have Jesus killed, because he deemed him to have thwarted his own personal dreams! Judas placed a love for worldly honor before his love for Jesus and, in the end, he “grew to love this desire with his whole heart.” (1926) With this as the primary desire of his life, he considered that such worldly honor could be secured by becoming a traitor. And when he betrayed Jesus, he full well knew that Jesus would be put to death.

Yes, the power of the human will is truly amazing. It can declare as reality something that ignores truths known to it. Indeed Judas correctly assessed that Jesus was going to allow himself to be destroyed by the Jewish rulers, but he falsely deduced that  this would “defeat the movement.” (1925) Though he “could not quite believe that the mighty works of the Master had been wrought by the power of the prince of devils,” he was still prepared to betray him to those who appeared to so believe.

And Judas was deemed to have sinned.

3. Then there were the apostles. Jesus beseeched them before his crucifixion and on practically each of his appearances after his resurrection that they should teach the gospel that he taught—and not a gospel about him. Again and again he almost begged them. But what did they do on the day of Pentecost? He had spelt out so often what he wanted from them, but they decided otherwise. Yet they loved him so dearly, they respected him so completely and still, of their own free will, they failed to honor what he asked from them.

What would Urantia be like now had the apostles adhered to Jesus' demand to preach  his gospel?

The gospel they decided to preach, with Peter initiating the decision, had instantaneous results. The apostles came to believe their own preaching with a passion that led them to being prepared to die for their beliefs. And many did so die. But from the viewpoint of Urantia's spiritual progress, I wonder what damage they did. They rearranged a revelation by their Creator Son in human form into the evolution of the historical expectations of the Jewish people. In doing so, they made a grave error that is still with us.

4. I read of Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia. I put them into a different league. They are superior beings and yet they, of their own free will, declared their own reality, and I imagine continue to believe that a grave injustice and abuse of themselves has been perpetrated. Or do they? They refuse to apologize. They turned their heads away when Jesus was crucified and yet, witness to his life down here, knowing full well that he is their creator father, they refused to see his Father, the Father whose existence they denied in going into rebellion.

How can they continue to deny the existence of God, our Universal Father, who, to higher spiritual beings must have so obviously revealed Himself as they watched Jesus living on Urantia. They would have known when Jesus refused to use his Creator Son powers, they were witnessing a demonstration of a power above his, and yet their reality, of their own free will, refused to include the existence of God and, I can only assume, has led to their discounting the contradictory evidence of this their reality. And so they are deemed iniquitous.

5. Adam and Eve. They were given a clear direction in relation to the number of pure line children they were to produce prior to mixing with the locals. Of their own free will they decided to go against the directives of their superiors. The disastrous results of their error were instantaneous.

So how do we dedicate our will, align our will to that of God? Simple! The book instructs us: “The will of God is the way of God, partnership with the choice of God in the face of any potential alternative.” (1431)

To assist us to do the will of God we are informed, “Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.” (2090)

Thus if we acquire that knowledge, in any life situation in which we find ourselves, we can seek the help of Jesus' Spirit of Truth in answering the question, “What would Jesus do.”  And if done in sincerity we can be assured our response will be God-like.

# On Hyping up our Hypothesis

Sydney Harris

There are those who look for truth and those who look for vindication. Those who only seek evidence to bolster or justify their position, and those who scrupulously search for all the evidence, for and against.

The disinterested search for truth is what gives science its truly “religious” quality—often more so than the religious quest which, too often, is concerned with digging out only evidence that buttresses its own dogmas and doctrines. In this sense, the scientist can be closer to the genuinely religious spirit than the zealous theologian.

How many theologians , for instance, would follow the noble and pathetic example of Frege, the mathematician who devised a new symbolic logic at the turn of this century?

Frege began writing a massive two volume work applying symbolic logic to mathematics. When the first volume appeared and the second was on the point of publication, Bertrand Russell pointed out a basic flaw in the very structure, since then known as “Russell's paradox,” that concerns the set of all sets being both a member and not a member of itself.

This “colossal and unique intellectual catastrophe” as Asimov termed it, forced Frege to add a final paragraph to the second volume of his life's work admitting that the very foundation of his reasoning was shattered and the books therefore were worthless.

Has anyone ever heard of a political, social, or religious leader admitting the same, rather than trying bitterly to refute his opponents?

The human capacity to process new facts so that they agree with our prior conclusions is almost limitless—and nearly ineradicable.

# The Death of Joseph

Author: **Ann Bendall, Qld.**

“Blind and unforeseen accidents do not occur in the cosmos” (556) and “material accidents, commonplace occurrences of a physical nature, are not arbitrarily interfered with by celestial personalities. Under ordinary circumstances only midway creatures can intervene in material conditions to safeguard the persons of men and women of destiny, and even in special situations these beings can so act only in obedience to the specific mandates of their superiors.” (1361)

And so it appears that no intervention was approved, or desired, when Joseph sustained injuries on the construction site which led to his death when Jesus was only 14. And we are advised that,

“Thus were permitted those occurrences of the natural order of events on Urantia which would force this young man of destiny so early to assume these heavy but highly educational and disciplinary responsibilities attendant upon becoming the head of a human family, of becoming father to his own brothers and sisters, of supporting and protecting his mother, of functioning as guardian of his father's home, the only home he was to know on this world.” (1388)

And so, shortly after Jesus had arrived at an awareness of his life purpose as being to reveal the nature of God to the world, he lost his father, the parent whose company he had so recently preferred to that of his mother (1386), and was confronted with shouldering the responsibility of an earthly family consisting of seven brothers and sisters, and an unborn child.

There were a number of apparent advantages in Joseph dying at this time, namely:

As the incarnation mandates of Sonarington forbid the leaving of human offspring behind on any planet by a bestowal son of Paradise origin, perhaps this precludes Creator Sons having the opportunity to parent children, unless all experience the untimely death of their father as occurred with Jesus. To his brothers and sisters he was regarded as a brother/father, and the Urantia Book refers to his having minimal opportunity to enjoy the company of the grandchildren due to his death in his thirties.

As part of Jesus' life, he experienced the worst tragedy of any child, the death of a parent, “all the more tragic to think that he died ere they could speak to him or hear his farewell blessing.” (1389).

Jesus experienced the worst tragedy of a parent, in the death of his young brother, Amos.

Jesus was present, and assisted Mary, at the birth of Ruth. He ran the household financially and emotionally due to Mary becoming a very depressed lady after the loss of her husband, and “This lad of Nazareth now became the sole support and comfort of this so suddenly bereaved family.....Jesus had a larger and longer experience rearing his family than was accorded to Joseph” (.1373) and, “the rigorous experience of supporting his family was a sure safeguard against his having overmuch time for idle meditation or the indulgence of mystic tendencies.” (1393)

“He left this world ripe in the experience which his creatures pass through during the short and strenuous years of their first life, the life in the flesh. and all of this human experience is an eternal possession of the Universe Sovereign. He is our understanding brother, sympathetic friend, experienced sovereign, and merciful father.” (1405)

What would have been Jesus' future had Joseph lived? Although a speculative question, in the vein of “what if,” it appears that there could have been a few major problems for Jesus fulfilling the mandate of his bestowal mission.

It had already been decided that he was to go to Jerusalem to study under the rabbis the following year. Hence, with Joseph's death, “at least one problem and anticipated difficulty in his life had been tragically solved—he would not now be expected to go to Jerusalem to study under the rabbis. It remained always true that Jesus 'sat at no man's feet.' He was ever willing to learn from even the humblest of little children, but he never derived authority to teach truth from human sources.” (1388)

At the age of 13 when he first attended the Passover at Jerusalem “everywhere Jesus went throughout the temple courts, he was shocked and sickened by the spirit of irreverence which he observed. He deemed the conduct of the temple throngs to be inconsistent with their presence in 'his Father's house.' But he received the shock of his young life when his father escorted him into the court of the gentiles with its noisy jargon, loud talking and cursing, mingled indiscriminately with the bleating of sheep and the babble of noises which betrayed the presence of the money-changers and the vendors of sacrificial animals and sundry other commercial commodities.” (1378).

At the age of 13, “under the surging of intense emotion,” he stated, “I will return to cleanse yonder temple and deliver my people from this bondage.” (1384). And so built up a righteous indignation which led to his driving the money lenders from the temple, thus challenging the Sanhedrin in a manner which led to the unanimous decision to exterminate him.
It is highly likely that, had he been forced to attend the school at Jerusalem that this righteous indignation would have blossomed into action within a short period of time, for, at the age of 13 he was posing such questions to the scribes and teachers as, “If God is a father who loves his children, why all this slaughter of animals to gain divine favor—has the teaching of Moses been misunderstood? .... Since the temple is dedicated to the worship of the Father in heaven, is it consistent to permit the presence of those engaged in secular barter and trade?” (1382)

Furthermore, “His training as a man of the realm had to be completed before he could enter upon his career of teaching and preaching as the perfected God-man of the divine and posthuman phases of his Urantia bestowal.” (1411) And it was not considered that he had reached this stage until he began his public career. It was obviously the desire of God that Jesus receive an intense training in “how man lived and wrought out his existence on Urantia,” which appears in excess of the requirements of his bestowal mandate. (1424)

When he returned from his trip around the Mediterranean basin the only trade he had not come in contact with was that of mining and, later in his public career, he corrected this deficit whilst he and the apostles were in Iron. (1643)

Again, it is postulated that, had he been required to attend the Jerusalem schools that his indignation against the religious leaders would have developed to the point of placing his life at threat. One thing Jesus never failed to respond to was the genuine question as to who he was. (1983;1991)

Next, his bestowal mandate forbade him becoming involved in politics, and he was forced to use his need to care for his family as an excuse in not joining a nationalistic cause because, “he could not intimate that he was more than a man; he could not disclose his idea of the mission which awaited his attainment of a riper manhood.” (1397).

Similarly with Rebecca's proposal he used his family responsibilities as an excuse but added, “if I am a son of destiny, I must not assume obligations of lifelong duration until such time as my destiny shall be made manifest.” (1403)

However, from Joseph's perspective, in dying prematurely, what did he gain or lose?

We are advised that by Jesus' 12th year, “Joseph entertained a growing belief in the spiritual nature of Jesus' mission. And but for other and more important reasons it does seem unfortunate that he could not have lived to see the fulfillment of his concept of Jesus' bestowal on earth.” (1372)

However, “The larger part of Joseph's family became believers in the teachings of Jesus, but very few of Mary's people ever believed in him until after he departed from this world. Joseph leaned more toward the spiritual concept of the expected Messiah, but Mary and her family, especially her father, held to the idea of the Messiah as a temporal deliverer and political ruler.” (1349)

Joseph is described as being, “subject to periods of mild spiritual discouragement,” when Jesus was a child but, “These temperamental manifestations were greatly improved just before his untimely death and after the economic conditions of his family had been enhanced by his advancement from the rank of carpenter to the role of a prosperous contractor.” (1348)

No light can be shed on the question of what Joseph gained or lost as a result of his untimely death. However, he died loving his son, being convinced of his spiritual mission, and had overcome his own spiritual discouragement.

Further information about parental influences on Jesus informs us:

Jesus derived much of his unusual gentleness and marvelous sympathetic understanding of human nature from his father.…
in emotional reactions to his adult-life environment, Jesus was at one time like his father, meditative and worshipful, sometimes characterized by apparent sadness; but more often he drove forward in the manner of his mother's optimistic and determined disposition..…
From Joseph, Jesus secured his strict training in the usage of the Jewish ceremonials and his unusual acquaintance with the Hebrew Scriptures; from Mary he derived a broader viewpoint of religious life and a more liberal concept of personal spiritual freedom. (1348)

And so: “Jesus naturally loved his people; he loved his family, and this natural affection had been tremendously augmented by his extraordinary devotion to them. The more fully we bestow ourselves upon our fellows, the more we come to love them; and since Jesus had given himself so fully to his family, he loved them with a great and fervent affection.”  (1319)

# On Introducing the Urantia Book

Author: **Ken Glasziou**

At the conclusion of this article, there is a short discussion of a segment in The Urantia Book that contains information unknown at the time of the first printing of the book, information impossible to guess and that remained unknown until the current decade. It is one among several similar segments of scientific information, presumably presented under the exclusion terms of their mandate. (1109/10) However this is unusual, and for the most part, the authors have used scientific knowledge that was current when the Urantia Papers were received in the mid-1930's. As was anticipated, much of this has long since been outdated. (1109)

As we head towards the fiftieth year since first publication of the book, much of its science and cosmology is now outdated to the point that any continuation of the  attempt to pass this book on to the general public under the label of a divine and infallible revelation is doomed to failure, even ridicule. It is also apparent that the revelators had accepted that divine authority and infallibility for the book would initially be assumed by its recipients. To counter this they included a “soon to be outdated cosmology,”—but warned us of their action.

The intransigent nature of earthlings is hardly new. At least as far back as the sixteenth century, Christian scholars have been aware that because of the large number of inconsistencies in the biblical text, it is logically impossible to treat the bible as a divine document guaranteed to be infallible by God.

Since then, Biblical scholarship has been such that the infallibility concept has not been taught in the theological institutions and seminaries of the majority of mainstream churches, at least since the early part of this century.1 However, among modern Christian congregations, the belief remains firmly entrenched and seemingly ineradicable.

The authors of the Urantia Papers have taken many steps to counter a “divine infallibility” label. In the “Favorite Places” section at the beginning of this issue, direct quotes from the authors of these papers repeatedly inform us that the truth content, even of revelation, whether secular or spiritual, is relative and not absolute—and will remain so short of our attainment of the Universal Father.

From the time of receipt of the papers, a large majority of book readers have assumed divine infallibility status for the Urantia Papers—a new “God's Bible” to correct and replace the old. Because of this, The Urantia Book has been ignored in virtually all theological circles. Another infallible revelation would be certain to be misused, just as the Bible has been misused.

Having become aware of the “outdated” problem, and having digested statements on revelation such as are quoted in our current “Favorite Places” section, many book readers have graduated past a fundamentalist attitude to The Urantia Book, and now accept the Papers and their content as was intended by their authors. The problem that now confronts us is how to present the benefits of the revelation to an unreceptive public.

One way may be to draw attention to an indisputable “prophetic” component of the book in order to help convince an inquiring potential reader that the book is worth reading. The article on electron radius that follows was put together at the behest of a reader who had received a request for such a proof. It is one of the best for that purpose as it requires no knowledge of science, and only a modest understanding of high school mathematics to work the thing through from start to finish and to appreciate the impossibility of guessing the result. Its technical content can also be readily confirmed from the internet web site of a Nobel prize winner.2

However, having convinced someone that the book is worth reading, what can be done to help an increasingly literate, well educated population to overlook the book's content of  outdated science and cosmology?

Many long term readers have found that their interest in the authorship and revelatory status of the book decreases in inverse proportion with their spiritual growth. And more and more they rely on the Spirit of Truth for confirmation and conviction of truth as they find it.

So can we inform a potential new reader of this truism? Fortunately there are about fifteen New Testament verses that confirm both the indwelling of our God-Spirit and the role of the Spirit of Truth. Hence, having provided an explanation of the role of the book's science and cosmology as being simply a transient universe frame in which to think, perhaps we should then follow Jesus' example and let the Spirit of Truth do its own work: “He never seemed to be curious about people, and he never manifested a desire to direct, manage, or follow them up.” (1875)

A time of change is ahead of us, a time in which book readers will progressively graduate from their book- and self-centeredness, to become solely God-centered. The rest will look after itself.

# Radius of the Electron

If the mass of matter should be magnified until that of an electron equaled one tenth of an ounce, then were the size to be proportionately magnified, the volume of such an electron would become as large as that of the Earth. (The Urantia Book, p. 477)

Anyone who went to the trouble of making that calculation prior to the 1990 period would have wondered if either they or the writer were making some silly error, for their answer would differ from the pre-1990 estimate by a factor of about a million up to infinity. Stefan Tallqvist, a physicist from the Technical Research Institute of Finland, finally cleared up the puzzle.

In the 1930's when the Urantia Papers were received, most physicists treated the electron as a dimensionless point, hence having no radius. Later some accepted a value of about 3 x 10-15 meters. Stefan's value obtained from working from the Urantia Paper's description comes out to 2.1 x 10-21 meters!! This is calculated as follows:

If the volume of a magnified electron is as large as the Earth than they have the same radius. The magnification factor to expand the electron is equal to one tenth of an ounce divided by the mass of an electron. Working in grams, a tenth of an  ounce is 2.8 grams which is to be divided by 9.1 x 10-28 grams, the rest mass of an electron. The answer gives the magnification factor of 3.07 x 1027.

Hence, the radius of the electron (R) would be given by the radius of the earth (6.4 x 106 meters) divided by the magnification factor. Thus:

R = 6.4 x 106 / 3.07 x 1027 meters
R = 2.1 x 10-21 meters

In the 1990's, Nobel Prize winner, Hans Dehmelt, found a way to make a single electron trap in which he could hold an electron for several years. Subsequent studies permitted a revision of the electron radius to be between 10-19 and 10-22 meters. More recently, in 1997, a further revision placed the radius at close to 10-22 meters, the difference from the Urantia Paper figure coming to a few parts in a 1000 billion billion.

There is no possible way that this could be some kind of coincidence. If we look at the mandate for the Urantia Book authors, we are informed that they were not permitted to provide us with unearned knowledge. (p. 1109-1110)  As would be expected because of the terms of the mandate, most of the scientific material in the book is of the quality found in text books of the early part of the century—and much is now out of date. However the mandate permitted the impartation of key material when considered appropriate and it appears that this apparently strange and unusual comparison between a magnified electron and the volume of the Earth is in that category. For those with an open mind, and who are prepared to give the matter thought, this and other similar semi-hidden information provides confirmation of the extraordinary nature of these Papers.

# The Urantia Book versus its  Philosophy

Author: **Ann Bendall, Qld.**

Peter and the apostles, afire with the Spirit of Truth, went right against Jesus' request/demand/injunction that they teach the gospel of the kingdom rather than teach his life, and so they created a religion about Jesus rather than the religion of Jesus—instantly turning a revelation-based religion into an  evolution-based one. Hence, “the kingdom as Jesus conceived it has to a large extent failed on earth” (1866)

When I first read The Urantia Book, I wanted to give it to everyone I knew. From a selfish perspective, this would enable the quality of my friendships to take a quantum step forward from my perspective. Every person on this planet could benefit from the reading of the book was my deduction and, although I verily continue to believe this, the reality is that the majority have no desire. What they need, for those who are “seeking,” is help and guidance. They need a philosophy of life which promises peace and joy and happiness, and which enables them to make sense of the doings and attitudes of all of their brothers and sisters.

They neither need or desire a book. I value the opportunity to have the book, and my gratitude is to the organization which ensured it was in existence.  But if we continue to put all effort into marketing the book, are we not making the same mistake that the apostles made with the fourth revelation?

I believe this is so, and I also believe it was never meant to replace the Bible. It was not given to us to form a new religion, or to heavily market. It was hoped instead that the individual who studied it would learn to exemplify its philosophy—Jesus' philosophy—and that, as a result of The Urantia Book, some men and women would take on “the religious challenge of this age” referred to by the Divine Counselor as, “to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new an appealing philosophy of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness. Such a new and righteous vision of morality will attract all that is good in the mind of man and challenge that which is best in the human soul.” (43)

As I currently view the future of Urantia in the light of reading The Urantia Book, I see two streams of spiritual development in our immanent future, both clearly stipulated in the book:

i) The first was hoped to be as a direct result of people becoming students of the book and then livers of its philosophy. These would be the individuals who would perform the “transcendent service” of ensuring “a revival of the actual teachings of Jesus, such a restatement as will undo the work of his early followers who went about to create a sociophilosophical system of belief regarding the fact of Michael's sojourn on earth. In a short time the teaching of this story about Jesus nearly supplanted the preaching of Jesus' gospel of the kingdom. In this way an historical religion displaced that teaching in which Jesus had blended man's highest moral ideas and spiritual ideals with man's sublime hope for the future - eternal life. And that was the gospel of the kingdom......but someday the true believers in Jesus will not be thus spiritually divided in their attitude before unbelievers. Always we may have diversity of intellectual comprehension and interpretation, even varying degrees of socialization, but lack of spiritual brotherhood is both inexcusable and reprehensible.” (1866)

The revelators are still waiting for us to become 'livers' of the philosophy of The Urantia Book, and "The time is ripe to witness the figurative resurrection of the human Jesus from his burial tomb amidst the theological traditions and the religious dogmas of nineteen centuries. Jesus of Nazareth must not be longer sacrificed to even the splendid concept of the glorified Christ. What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology, and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions. …(2090)

“....Indeed, the social readjustments, the economic transformations, the moral rejuvenations, and the religious revisions of Christian civilization would be drastic and revolutionary if the living religion of Jesus should suddenly supplant the theologic religion about Jesus. To 'follow Jesus' means to personally share his religious faith and to enter into the spirit of the Master's life of unselfish service for man. One of the most important things in human living is to find out what Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement of his exalted life purpose. Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it.” (2090)

ii) The second: The reformation of the Christian churches. In the past 40 years there have been major changes occurring in Christianity, and it is now on the brink of the next great step which The Urantia Book sees as, “The hope of modern Christianity is that it should cease to sponsor the social systems and industrial policies of Western civilization.” (2086) But for the church to, “humbly bow itself before the cross it so valiantly extols, there to learn anew from Jesus of Nazareth the greatest truths mortal man can ever hear—the living gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man,” we must patiently await that time when enough of its members become actual “livers” of the religion of Jesus—for  “Christianity is an extemporized religion, and therefore must it operate in low gear. High-gear spiritual performances must await the new revelation and the more general acceptance of the real religion of Jesus.” (2086)

“Mistake not! there is in the teachings of Jesus an eternal nature which will not permit them forever to remain unfruitful in the hearts of thinking men. The kingdom as Jesus conceived it has to a large extent failed on earth; for the time being an outward church has taken its place; but you should comprehend that this church is only the larval stage of the thwarted spiritual kingdom, which will carry it through this material age and over into a more spiritual dispensation where the Master's teachings may enjoy a fuller opportunity for development.” (1866) [Note the word “may.”]

“Thus does the so-called Christian church become the cocoon in which the 'kingdom of Jesus' concept now slumbers. The kingdom of the divine brotherhood is still alive and will eventually and certainly come forth from this long submergence, just as surely as the butterfly eventually emerges as the beautiful unfolding of its less attractive creature of metamorphic development.” (1866)

“These various groupings of Christians may serve to accommodate numerous different types of would-be believers among the various peoples of Western civilization, but such division of Christendom presents a grave weakness when it attempts to carry the gospel of Jesus to Oriental peoples. These races do not yet understand that there is a religion of Jesus separate, and somewhat apart, from Christianity, which has more and more become a religion about Jesus.” (2086)
