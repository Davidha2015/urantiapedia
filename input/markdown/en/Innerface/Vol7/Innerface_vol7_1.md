# Personal Realities

"Spirit is the basic personal reality in the universes, and personality is basic to all progressing experience with spiritual reality. Every phase of personality experience on every successive level of universe progression swarms with clues to the discovery of alluring personal realities. Man's true destiny consists in the creation of new and spirit goals and then in responding to the cosmic allurements of such supernal goals of nonmaterial value." (141)

Of the multitude of inspiring revelatory statements in the Urantia Papers, is this not among the most meaningful?

There is something grand and ineffable about the statement that our true destiny is to create new and spirit goals for our daily living—and to then pursue their fulfillment.

"True destiny" has to be greater than, but inclusive of, our temporary dwelling time on this planet. However, since we are advised to seek to "serve as we pass by," and "to take no anxious thought," it would appear that the goals we set ourselves should be located in the here and now. They should be supernal and of spirit rather than of material value.

The Papers also advise us of the importance of "being" before "doing," meaning that we have to "be righteous" or to "be loving" before acts implying righteousness or love actually take on spiritual value.

See the article "What Really Survives" for enlightenment on spirit goals.

# Mind and Consciousness.

Modern Theory and the Urantia Papers: A Story of Convergence?

Ken Glasziou

The purpose of this article is to provide a brief discussion about why "classical" concepts of the mind are considered to have failed, and how new work invoking quantum theory may eventually provide a viable alternative. These new ideas are compared with what the Urantia Papers state about mind and personality.

Scientific research has provided new insights into the mind and its functioning that cannot be reconciled with older interpretations. In the past, a view accepted by most researchers considered the material world to be the reality which the mind interprets via its sensory inputs after processing the inputs through some kind of computational procedure.

However the actual input from our sensory organs is very far from what we imagine to be our reality. For example, if we walk into a hotel dining room we may see a rectangular table. If we walk around the table to get to where the breakfast items are laid out, any occasional glances at the rectangular table are unlikely to consciously register changes to its shape.

If we had the equipment to photograph the retinal images at the back of our eyeballs, we would get an entirely different picture. At no time would the image of the table be rectangular, it would be trapezoid. That trapezoid figure would also keep changing shape depending on the angle of perception.

Remarkably, if our entrance to the dining room had been down a set of stairs we may have viewed a number of different tables, some rectangular, some square, some  round, and some of markedly different size. All of this, we could take in at a glance, and all of our impressions would be approximately correct if we later checked them through measurement. Again the photographic record of what we really "saw" in our retinal images would quite amaze us.

The scene gets much more complicated if we compared our retinal images with what we think we see when viewing a landscape having different sized objects at varying distances, perhaps with some moving relative to the others.

Our cursory glance provides us with the impression of a three dimensional scene in which our mental impression of the different size objects at different distances has their shape and size appropriately adjusted and even their relative speeds of movement appropriate to the distances at which we deem them to be. However the images on our retina are only two dimensional and have their shapes distorted by being projected onto the curved surface at the back of our eyeballs. So, regardless of the detail of how our minds sort the scene, the fact is that the information we gather through our senses is abstract, and our view of what is reality appears to have been derived only after some kind of computation.

If abstract computation is going on in the brain, the concrete and reliable look of the world has no obvious explanation. We might also ask ourselves who or what does the computing and who could have written the exceedingly complex mathematical program that would be needed to transform the input data? In the absence of sensible answers being forthcoming from materialist philosophy and classical physics, many have sought for possible mechanisms in the strange world of quantum physics.

From its inception, quantum physics has proposed, then proved, the unbelievable. And even after fifty or more years since the unbelievable has been demonstrated as true, people continue to devise more experiments just to make sure it really is so. Some of these curiosities are the superpositioning of states when a particle has the potential to be in more than a single state—particle or wave for example. The particle appears to remain "undecided" about what it is and so remains in a "suspended" state until an observer decides to look. Then the particle obliges by being a particle if the observer looks for a particle, or being a wave if he/she looks for a wave. Perhaps that would not seem so extraordinary if it were not for the fact that the object in superposition appears to be able to make the correct decision before it actually "knows" what the observer wants from it. How does the mind of the observer get into this scene?

Then there is "non-locality" such as is seen when twin photons are travelling in opposite directions and we place a polarizer in the path of each such that there is only a fifty percent chance of getting through. We then find that if one gets through its polarizer, its twin does the same. Worse is to come. This holds good even if the photons are separated by a distance at which no signal travelling at the speed of light could pass between them. Called non-locality, it will hold even if the photons are at opposite ends of the universe. Initially demonstrated in the laboratory, this phenomenon is now the subject of competition for "the greatest distance of separation" and is already extended to many kilometers.

It is the strangeness of quantum phenomena that has induced researchers to wonder whether equally strange brain phenomena are the result of having root in the world of the quantum. Work is still mostly theoretical—taking a lead from quantum physics in which proposals and their demonstration sometimes were separated by much more than fifty years. For example, Bose-Einstein condensates (comprising a large number of molecules forming what is virtually a super atom in superposition) have only recently been demonstrated, though they were first proposed more than seventy years ago.

Initially this quantum approach received a boost when it was put forward to help explain what was being called the "hard problem,"  meaning the difficult task of accounting for the existence of consciousness and self-consciousness in the material world. Those convicted of materialist philosophy dismiss consciousness as a figment of the imagination and seek to explain all mental phenomena in terms of cause-effect relationships. Logically, this approach must culminate in the dismissal of choice and free will, and make all events the linear consequence of preceding events. Thus nobody is really responsible for their actions—we all do what we do because we cannot do otherwise. So what is justice or righteousness?

Those who take the "hard problem" seriously include many of our ablest physicists as well as those trained in the neurosciences. In fact it is now becoming essential to have substantial comprehension of quantum physics and its basic mathematics in order to work in the field of neurophysiology.

Among some in this field, the so-called "hard problem" has taken a quantum leap plus a reversal in that the "I" at the heart of the problem is taken for granted and the explanation of how "I" can know anything about the "world out there" takes up the honor of being the "hard problem." Some in this group break consciousness down into self or subject denoted by "I"; cognition; awareness of the world; and qualia (subjective experience accompanying, say—the smell of coffee; the fear of heights; etc.)

"I" is all important, it is not local in the sense that it can be found anywhere, it is not a thing that has extension, but at the same time it is "infinitely near." This infinitely near yet unlocatable "self" has agency. Its function is control. But though unlocatable it has an address, being somehow associated with our bodies and brains.

Coupled with this view there are proposed mechanisms in which the brain has a system of neural units about 50 microns in diameter which exhibit behavior somewhat like a Bose-Einstein condensate operating as a superposed unit in a non-local manner (instantaneous). Normally in a kind of ground state, these units may undergo symmetry breaking which signals some kind of event. A quasi-crystalline form of water that forms dipolar units, along with the microtubules that form a continuous system to link together the cells of living organisms, are envisaged as forming a quantum electro-chemical mechanism that takes control instructions from "I" to the "not-I" components of self. All this is speculation designed to provide some physical support mechanism allowing "I" to do his/her thing in the world.

Whereas the logical path for the materialist view of self led to a body and brain that does what it does because it cannot do otherwise, the view that gives this central role to "I" makes it into a non-local control center for which "I's" meanings and values become its control variables.

How does "I" function in the world. Pushed to the limits, "I" am a monad surrounded by a quantum domain that is unseeable and unfathomable. My world is my own; your world is your own. Yet I somehow make sense out of it and do connect with the outside world—your world when appropriate. How "I" does this is now the hard problem. One suggestion is that the brain generates quantum fields that represent a library of superposed possibilities. Sensory inputs, rather than undergoing some kind of information processing, simply interact with a page in the library composed of appropriate superposed possibilities. "I's" meanings and values are then the control variables that operate to select among the pages of possibilities to provide a match by which the world is perceived. This is a non-linear system with a high degree of spontaneity. As such it corresponds much more closely to what most of us believe is reality than the dismal view taken by the materialist-mechanists.

What do the Urantia Papers say about mind and consciousness? In actuality there is so much that we can only hope to cover a few of the salient features. What neurophysiologists are calling "I" appears to roughly correspond to a combined personality, mind, and soul as used in the Papers. Personality is a gift from the Universal Father, mind is directly from the Universe Mother Spirit and indirectly from the Infinite Spirit and the Seven Master Spirits. Soul is in the hands of the indwelling Father-Spirit who preserves all that is of spiritual value to be taken forward into our morontia life.

Personality is distinguished by two self-manifesting phenomena, self-consciousness and relative free will, both of which are properties of the "I" of the neurophysiologist. It is our personality that gives us the prerogative of choice.

We need to be aware that the Urantia Papers use the term, personality, in a markedly different way to its common usage. In common usage, personality is something that develops, changes, evolves, and grows. Personality, as used in the Urantia Papers, is a pattern of potentials that can be called into action. However that pattern is individual, unique, and unchanging. It is unifying and confers identity but is not in itself our identity. Personality enables us to respond to three basic mind realities, the mathematical or logical recognition of physical causation, the reasoned recognition of the obligation of moral conduct, and the faith-grasp of fellowship worship of Deity associated with the loving service of humanity.

Importantly, it is our personality that responds to other-personality presence.

Mind is complementary to personality and comes tailored to the specific needs of the creature. Unlike our personality which is permanently ours, our mind is not permanent. We get a new and different mind on the mansion worlds, and minds suited to our advancing status as we progress towards Paradise.

The human type mind is endowed with the capacity to reason, to distinguish relative right and wrong, and to recognize spiritual values. Personality has the capacity to activate potentials inherent in the mind, especially the three major classes of attributes deriving from Cosmic Mind and classified as causation, duty, and worship.

The "I" of the quantum neurophysiologist appears to be on track to be identified as a very limited combination of personality and mind as they are described in great detail in the Urantia Papers—certainly there is a degree of convergence between the two. In contrast, there is almost nothing in common to be found in the concepts expounded in the Urantia Papers and those views advanced by any materialist-mechanist interpretation of mind.

It appears to be unlikely that any scientific methodology could ever be developed that could verify or even throw light upon the detailed revelations in the Papers concerning personality and mind. The Papers say little about mind-brain interaction, the nearest thing being, "Human consciousness rests gently upon the electrochemical mechanism below and delicately touches the spirit-morontia energy system above." The Papers do declare that personality is a universe mystery, and mind is certainly a mystery to us Urantians. This is the stuff of revelation—and some things have to be accepted in faith.

# Is there Certainty?

Ken Glasziou

Early in the century, mathematician-philosopher Kurt Godell staggered the academic world when he proved that no system of mathematics could ever be shown to be totally self-consistent. And since mathematics is the base upon which all science is built, and since science is the basis of all verifiable knowledge, then we are left with a conundrum. We can only speak in terms of probabilities.

But does Godell have the final word. For example, can I not say with absolute certainty, "I know that I exist?" And this is not really a probability, for no matter how many trials I undertake, I would never have just cause to reply in the negative. Or would I? Could I not be dreaming that I exist? But if that were true then surely there would be an "I" who is doing the dreaming—and at least that "I" must really exist!

Is there a God? And if there is, and God created all things, then am I not a "something" that really does exist even if only in the mind of God? And if that is true, then for sure, God exists, and in him, I think, I move, I breathe and I have my very being. I'll settle for that.

# The Alpheus Twins

Author: **Ann Bendall**

The apostles passionately desired the 'kingdom' to be an earthly one which would come in power and glory, and James and John Zebedee perceived themselves as being in a position of honor, the first chosen ambassadors. Returning from their search for Jesus in the Perean hills to discover that Peter and Andrew "had become the first accepted counselors of the new kingdom" saddened them to the extent of waking Jesus demanding an explanation.

Four months later, the next blow to their perceived position came when Jesus instructed each of his now six chosen apostles to choose "one man from among his early converts for membership in the projected corps of apostles." (1538) John immediately requested clarification of the proposed rank for these proposed additional six, with Jesus affirming that "the men you choose shall become one with us." (1539)

John and his brother, James, solved what was apparently a dilemma by choosing James and Judas Alpheus, very effectively ensuring no equality, for the Alpheus twins "were the least of all the apostles; they knew it and felt cheerful about it."

There is not much to be said about these two commonplace fisherfolk. They loved their Master and Jesus loved them, but they never interrupted his discourses with questions. They understood very little about the philosophical discussions or the theological debates of their fellow apostles, but they rejoiced to find themselves numbered amongst such a group of mighty men.

Andrew assigned them to the work of policing the multitudes. They were the chief ushers of the preaching hours, and, in fact, the general servants and errand boys of the twelve—and they were always ready to lend a helping hand to any one of the apostles. (1563)

Rarely are the referred to separately in the Urantia Papers. Never is there a reference to Jesus speaking to them individually. The "mediocre twins" were "almost identical in personal appearance, mental characteristics, and extent of spiritual perception. What can be said of one should be recorded of the other."

Only on two occasions is there reference to Judas Alpheus making "bold to ask one of the few questions which either he or his brother ever addressed to the Master in public. "(1948)

The first mentioned gives an indication of the pervasiveness of the "chosen few" philosophy amongst the twelve apostles when, after Jesus had talked about revealing himself openly to the world, Judas Alpheus "felt a little disappointed that there were to be no more secrets among the twelve, and he made bold to ask: But, Master, when you do thus declare yourself to the world, how will you favor us with special manifestations of your goodness?" (1563)

The second, at the Last Supper, was again by Judas Alpheus, when he questioned Jesus as  to how they would recognize the new teacher (Spirit of Truth) and although "Judas Alpheus did not fully understand what the Master said, he grasped the promise of a new teacher, and from the expression on Andrew's face, he perceived that his question had been satisfactorily answered." (1949)

However, the twins loved Jesus, they "served faithfully until the end, until the dark days of trial, crucifixion, and despair. They never lost their heart faith in Jesus, and (save John) they were the first to believe in his resurrection. But they could not comprehend the establishment of the kingdom." (1563) Nor could they comprehend Jesus' mind, "but they did grasp the sympathetic bond between themselves and the heart of their Master. Their minds were not of a high order, they might even reverently be called stupid, but they had a real experience in their spiritual natures. They believed in Jesus; they were sons of God and fellows of the kingdom." ((1563)

Despite the motives of John and James Zebedee who chose the twins as apostles, "Jesus welcomed these young men of one talent to positions of honor on his personal staff in the kingdom because there are untold millions of other such simple and fear ridden souls on the worlds of space whom he likewise wishes to welcome into active and believing fellowship with himself and his outpoured Spirit of Truth. Jesus does not look down on littleness, only upon evil and sin. James and Judas were little, but they were also faithful. They were simple and ignorant, but they were also big-hearted, kind, and generous." (1564)

The ordination of the apostles as public preachers of the gospel of the kingdom was a momentous day in their lives. That night while Jesus went for a walk upon the beach, the apostles talked among themselves, and "the twins built a small fire to give them warmth and more light."

Later, despite Jesus' request that they "go to their rest so as to be ready for tomorrow's work," each requested a private talk—with the exception of the twins "who had fallen asleep." (1578) To Andrew's question to Jesus as to whether he should waken them to see if they too would like a private talk, Jesus "smilingly" replied, "They do well, trouble them not."  And at Gilboa, whilst the apostles puzzled as to what the kingdom would be when it came, "the twins were blissfully ignorant of the controversy. (1618) 
Similarly when Jesus started to employ the parable method of teaching the multitudes, to the heated debate which arose on the interpretation of the parable of the sower, "with the exception of the Alpheus twins, each of the apostles ventured to make an interpretation of the parable of the sower before they retired for the night." (1691)

Whenever the apostles' emotional and mental status is mentioned, such as at the crisis at Capernaum leading to the closing of the synagogues to Jesus' teaching where "there was a tension of uncertainty and suspense of apprehension resting upon all of them….The only word of cheerful greeting or well-wishing from any of his immediate followers came from one of the unsuspecting Alpheus twins, who, as Jesus left the house on his way to the synagogue, saluted him cheerily and said, "We pray the Father will help you, and that we will have bigger multitudes than ever." (1707)

On Palm Sunday…"to the Alpheus twins this was a perfect day. They really enjoyed it all the way through and not being present during the time of quiet visitation about the temple, the escaped much of the anticlimax of the popular upheaval. They could not possibly understand the downcast behavior of the apostles when they came back to Bethany that evening. In the menory of the twins, this was always their day of being nearest heaven on earth. This day was the satisfying climax of their whole career as apostles. And the memory of the elation of this Sunday afternoon carried them through all the tragedy of this eventful week, right up to the hour of the crucifixion. It was the most befitting entry of the king that the twins could conceive; they enjoyed every moment of the whole pageant. They fully approved of all they saw and long cherished the memory. (1886)

However by the Monday night after Jesus had cleansed the temple, "Even the Alpheus twins were at last aroused to the realization that the events of the Master's life were moving swiftly towards their final culmination." (1896) And, on Tuesday morning in greeting each of the apostles personally, "To the Alpheus twins, he said, 'Do not allow the things which you cannot understand to crush you. Be true to the affections of your hearts and put not your trust in either great men or the changing attitudes of the people. Stand by your brethren.'" (1897)

Despite their being "stupid" Jesus embraced them as his "apostles and you always shall be" and he promised to remember them in the kingdom to come. (1960) He also affirmed their survival as a fact, and portrayed a future on "other and better worlds where you shall likewise work for me. And in all of this work, on this world and on other worlds, I will work with you, and my spirit shall dwell within you," (2049) even defining this future, at the Last Supper, as one in which he would receive them "on high, where in glory you shall tell of your salvation to seraphic hosts and to multitudes of the high sons of God."

And at Galilee in his morontia appearance, Jesus in speaking to both of the Alpheus twins, reiterated the advice he had given them at the Last Supper, advice which I attempt, albeit disappointingly, as I plod along through the menial chores of my daily life, "Have faith in God to the end of your days on earth. Never forget that, when you are a faith son of God, all upright  work of the realm is sacred. Nothing which a son of God does can be common. Do your work, therefore, from this point on, as for God." (2049)

The Alpheus twins "lived and died conscious of having been honored and blessed with four years of close and personal association with a Son of God, the sovereign maker of a universe." (1564)

# Are the Urantia Papers the Divine Word of God?

Ken Glasziou

The information in the Papers that relates directly to this question is scattered right throughout the text of their pages. Extraordinarily, the mandate defining the "universe rules" of revelation is not described until midway through the Papers, and  the authors' explanations of their use of human sources are split between  near the beginning and two thirds of the way through. Such important references surely ought to have been in a preface or in an introduction?

Expositions on the relativity and evolutionary nature of truth get mentioned in many different places. This peculiarity of presentation has made it quite difficult to obtain a coordinated and unbroken overview of the degree of authority to be afforded to revelation that stems from a variety of celestial sources—some admittedly of only marginally higher status than the intended recipients.

Possibly because of its association with that frequently declared claim that the Bible is the infallible word of God, for many of us this word "revelation" carries the subconscious connotation of being "God-ordained, hence infallible." Perhaps it is not surprising that a similar expectation for divine infallibility has been widely accorded to the text of the Urantia Papers. But is this really a valid expectation? The scattered nature of the evidence makes it difficult to decide. So is there a way to improve our comprehension in such circumstances?

Recent research has shown that, for many of us, the graphical presentation of information is a valuable supplementary aid to understanding. The flow diagrams presented on the following pages employ this medium in the hope of clarifying the significance of these unique and remarkable Papers

# "Pity my Simplicity"

"...the simple teachings of the Jesusonian gospel: sonship with God, brotherhood with man, and ever-ascending citizenship in the eternal universe." (1038)

The key to this "simple" doctrine is the very nature of God as it was revealed in the life of Jesus of Nazareth. This nature was most effectively revealed in Jesus' parables, in particular, in these:

The prodigal son
The lost sheep
The lost coin
The widow's mite
The workers in the vineyard
The father who would not give his son a stone when he asked for bread.

In all of these, and elsewhere, Jesus revealed a God who contrasted strongly with the God of his people. In Jesus' day, Yahweh was a tribal God who rewarded the tribe for obedience, punished their disobedience, and, when it suited him, delivered them from their enemies.

The God revealed in the life of Jesus was a God of infinite love, compassion, and mercy, one who was also God to the prostitute, the Samaritan, the tax-collector, and even the simple-minded. If we can imagine a perfect earthly father, then the heavenly Father revealed by Jesus was: infinitely more loving, infinitely more merciful, infinitely more wise, infinitely more just, and infinitely greater in all respects than any we can imagine.

The Jesusonian gospel included sonship with God and ascending citizenship in the eternal universe. In its modern context, sonship with God means membership in the family of God on earth. Nowhere is its meaning given a higher degree of reality than in that component of the story of Jesus life on earth when he undertakes the "father-role" to his Nazareth family following after the untimely death of his earthly father, Joseph.

The meaning of "ever-ascending citizenship in the eternal universe" entails a spiritualization of our very being and nowhere is its meaning better illustrated as a possibility for mere mortals than in the story of Jesus' life from his birth to his baptism in the Jordan.

Up until his baptism, Jesus lived exactly as do all other humans since the bestowal of his Spirit of Truth at Pentecost—a life in which he had to tread his own pathway of discovery to the meaning of God's centrality in the unfolding of his individuality. 

However all of us who are fortunate enough to have found The Urantia Book, and have been blessed by having minds in which our previous experiences of earthly living have not shut us off from exploring its content, all such have an enormous advantage over the babe of Bethlehem who had to make his discoveries without this help. And to help us to understand even better, we are given Jesus' Spirit of Truth.

If we see ourselves as chosen people, in some way being rewarded as special by God, we may have missed the point. By our knowing of the content of the Urantia Papers, we have dismissed any possible claim to be numbered with the ignorant who demonstrate that redeeming "faintest flicker of faith." By stint of the knowledge with which we have been blessed, far more is required from us. Apparently simplicity has its rewards.

# What Really Survives?

Ken Glasziou

Most new readers of the Urantia Papers experience a feeling of exultation and relief as they learn that even those Urantians in whom the faintest flicker of faith still flickers will receive the chance to go on to the mansion worlds after mortal death. We may even get the impression that, except for a new and better body and a new and better mind, we more or less start off on the first mansion world exactly where we left off here on Urantia. But what actually does survive from our life on Urantia?

Re-personalization is described in Paper 112. The reassembly of our constituent bits and pieces involves, first, the fabrication of a new morontia body and mind followed by the return of our Thought Adjuster, the custodian of our identity, who supervises the return of our personality. Next to arrive is our soul, an entity built up during mortal life by our Thought Adjuster through the conservation of all things from that life having either spiritual value or being essential for our future universe careers. During this transition period, the soul has been in the custody of a special seraphic guardian. 

Our re-awakening is likely to be a bit of a shock. We will be so changed, the spiritual transformation will be so great that if were not for the Adjuster and the destiny guardian administering the morontia equivalent of first aid, much of the mortal life would at first seem to be a vague and hazy dream. (1235) So much for our delusions about starting where we left off on Urantia.

What survives of our mortal memories and attributes is the responsibility of our Thought Adjuster whose task is to recall and rehearse only those memories and experiences that are part of, and essential to, our future universe career. What may these be?

We are informed:  "much of your past life and its memories, having neither spiritual meaning nor morontia value, will perish with the material brain; much of material experience will pass away as onetime scaffolding which, having bridged you over to the morontia level, no longer serves a purpose in the universe" (1235) . 

The mansion worlds are the morontia worlds, morontia being a term covering a vast level that intervenes between the material and the spiritual.The step from material to spiritual is simply too enormous to be bridged directly.

Material beings like ourselves could never cope with these changes that lead to an entirely spiritual existence if it were not for that direct gift we have from God of an actual fragment of himself we know as his "Indwelling Spirit" or "Thought Adjuster."

The presence of this divine Adjuster in the human mind is disclosed by three experiential phenomena:
1. Our intellectual capacity for knowing God—God-consciousness.
2. Our spiritual urge to find God—to be God-seeking.
3. The craving of our personality to be like God—the wholehearted desire to do the Father's will." (24)

For better understanding of the next stage in our universe career, we need to be critically  aware that all that is "personal" about ourselves  that survives into the morontia life, is processed by our Thought Adjuster because it has some kind of potential "spiritual value."

The reason for this is that in the spirit world which is to follow our temporary morontia existence, the things of this world, those things associated with material matter, simply have no existence, hence are useless. If we value our experience on this planet and hope to take at least some traces of it with us, then we need to develop a "feeling" for those intangible concepts so frequently referred to as "spiritual meanings and values." The Papers tell us :

"...when an attempt is made to make plain the realities of the spirit world to the physical minds of the material order, mystery appears: mysteries so subtle and so profound that only the faith-grasp of the God-knowing mortal can achieve the philosophic miracle of the recognition of the Infinite by the finite, the discernment of the eternal God by the evolving mortals of the material worlds of time and space." (27)

What applies to "infinite" and "eternal" also applies to "spiritual." Over and over again, the Papers refer to spiritual meanings and values with no further elaboration.

"Spiritual" is a term that has similarities to concepts in our language for which the meaning is "in the eye of the beholder." To specify exactly what we mean by holding that a particular object is more beautiful than another, we would need some scale to judge their relative beauty against our ideal of perfect beauty.

We can think about "spiritual" in a similar way if we make the characteristics and nature of God himself, our ideal of "perfection." But in doing so we are immediately confronted by our absence of real knowledge of the perfection of God—except in so far as that perfection has already been revealed to us.

For this, we have two main sources—personal and individual revelation between each of us and our Thought Adjusters and the revelation of God's nature provided for us in the bestowal life of Jesus of Nazareth. And because of the real difficulties beings such as ourselves have with establishing reliable communication with our Thought Adjuster, that revelatory life of Jesus is our principal source for understanding "spiritual meanings and values" in so far as they can be comprehended by beings whose total experience is dominated by association with matter..

And surely it goes without saying that nothing could be more important for our spiritual progress than an understanding of what spiritual progress really entails.

What is spiritual?

There are two approaches to understanding what spiritual "is." Since God is pure spirit, all that pertains to the character and nature of deity must reflect God's spirituality. This will encompass all deity, including the revelation of the nature of God given to Urantians through the life of Jesus. Our second source is direct statement in the Papers about what spirituality is. The following quotations may be of help:

"But the love of God is an intelligent and farseeing parental affection. The divine love functions in unified association with divine wisdom and all other infinite characteristics of the perfect nature of the Universal Father. God is love, but love is not God. The greatest manifestation of the divine love for mortal beings is observed in the bestowal of the Thought Adjusters, but your greatest revelation of the Father's love is seen in the bestowal life of his Son Michael as he lived on earth the ideal spiritual life. It is the indwelling Adjuster who individualizes the love of God to each human soul." (40)

"The Eternal Son is the great mercy minister to all creation. Mercy is the essence of the Son's spiritual character. The mandates of the Eternal Son, as they go forth over the spirit circuits of the Second Source and Center, are keyed in tones of mercy." (75)

"The Eternal Son is wholly spiritual; man is very nearly entirely material;" (78)

"Spirit is the basic personal reality in the universes, and personality is basic to all progressing experience with spiritual reality. Every phase of personality experience on every successive level of universe progression swarms with clues to the discovery of alluring personal realities. Man's true destiny consists in the creation of new and spirit goals and then in responding to the cosmic allurements of such supernal goals of nonmaterial value." (141)

"When the spiritual tests of greatness are applied, the moral elements are not disregarded, but the quality of unselfishness revealed in disinterested labor for the welfare of one's earthly fellows, particularly worthy beings in need and in distress, that is the real measure of planetary greatness. And the manifestation of greatness on a world like Urantia is the exhibition of self-control. The great man is not he who 'takes a city' or 'overthrows a nation,' but rather 'he who subdues his own tongue.'" (317)

"To finite man, truth, beauty, and goodness embrace the full revelation of divinity reality. As this love-comprehension of Deity finds spiritual expression in the lives of God-knowing mortals, there are yielded the fruits of divinity: intellectual peace, social progress, moral satisfaction, spiritual joy, and cosmic wisdom... Advanced mortals have learned that love is the greatest thing in the universe—and they know that God is love. Love is the desire to do good to others." (648)

"Spirituality becomes at once the indicator of one's nearness to God and the measure of one's usefulness to fellow beings. Spirituality enhances the ability to discover beauty in things, recognize truth in meanings, and discover goodness in values. Spiritual development is determined by capacity therefor and is directly proportional to the elimination of the selfish qualities of love." (1096)

"The goal of human self-realization should be spiritual, not material. The only realities worth striving for are divine, spiritual, and eternal." (1096)

"One of the most amazing earmarks of religious living is that dynamic and sublime peace, that peace which passes all human understanding, that cosmic poise which betokens the absence of all doubt and turmoil. Such levels of spiritual stability are immune to disappointment. (1101)

"The divine spirit makes contact with mortal man, not by feelings or emotions, but in the realm of the highest and most spiritualized thinking. It is your thoughts, not your feelings, that lead you Godward. The divine nature may be perceived only with the eyes of the mind. But the mind that really discerns God, hears the indwelling Adjuster, is the pure mind. "Without holiness no man may see the Lord." All such inner and spiritual communion is termed spiritual insight. Such religious experiences result from the impress made upon the mind of man by the combined operations of the Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth as they function amid and upon the ideas, ideals, insights, and spirit strivings of the evolving sons of God." (1104)

"Through religious faith the soul of man reveals itself and demonstrates the potential divinity of its emerging nature by the characteristic manner in which it induces the mortal personality to react to certain trying intellectual and testing social situations. Genuine spiritual faith (true moral consciousness) is revealed in that it:

1. Causes ethics and morals to progress despite inherent and adverse animalistic tendencies.
2. Produces a sublime trust in the goodness of God even in the face of bitter disappointment and crushing defeat.
3. Generates profound courage and confidence despite natural adversity and physical calamity.
4. Exhibits inexplicable poise and sustaining tranquillity notwithstanding baffling diseases and even acute physical suffering.
5. Maintains a mysterious poise and composure of personality in the face of maltreatment and the rankest injustice.
6. Maintains a divine trust in ultimate victory in spite of the cruelties of seemingly blind fate and the apparent utter indifference of natural forces to human welfare.
7. Persists in the unswerving belief in God despite all contrary demonstrations of logic and successfully withstands all other intellectual sophistries.
8. Continues to exhibit undaunted faith in the soul's survival regardless of the deceptive teachings of false science and the persuasive delusions of unsound philosophy.
9. Lives and triumphs irrespective of the crushing overload of the complex and partial civilizations of modern times.
10. Contributes to the continued survival of altruism in spite of human selfishness, social antagonisms, industrial greeds, and political maladjustments.
11. Steadfastly adheres to a sublime belief in universe unity and divine guidance regardless of the perplexing presence of evil and sin.
12. Goes right on worshiping God in spite of anything and everything. Dares to declare, "Even though he slay me, yet will I serve him." (1108)

"The Supreme is the beauty of physical harmony, the truth of intellectual meaning, and the goodness of spiritual value." (1278)

"Goodness is always growing toward new levels of the increasing liberty of moral self-realization and spiritual personality attainment—the discovery of, and identification with, the indwelling Adjuster. An experience is good when it heightens the appreciation of beauty, augments the moral will, enhances the discernment of truth, enlarges the capacity to love and serve one's fellows, exalts the spiritual ideals, and unifies the supreme human motives of time with the eternal plans of the indwelling Adjuster, all of which lead directly to an increased desire to do the Father's will, thereby fostering the divine passion to find God and to be more like him." (1458)

"Goodness is living, relative, always progressing, invariably a personal experience, and everlastingly correlated with the discernment of truth and beauty. Goodness is found in the recognition of the positive truth-values of the spiritual level, which must, in human experience, be contrasted with the negative counterpart—the shadows of potential evil." (1458)

"There is unity in the cosmic universe if you could only discern its workings in actuality. The real universe is friendly to every child of the eternal God. The real problem is: How can the finite mind of man achieve a logical, true, and corresponding unity of thought? This universe-knowing state of mind can be had only by conceiving that the quantitative fact and the qualitative value have a common causation in the Paradise Father. Such a conception of reality yields a broader insight into the purposeful unity of universe phenomena; it even reveals a spiritual goal of progressive personality achievement." (1477)

"Jesus made it plain that he had come to establish personal and eternal relations with men which should forever take precedence over all other human relationships. And he emphasized that this intimate spiritual fellowship was to be extended to all men of all ages and of all social conditions among all peoples. The only reward which he held out for his children was: in this world—spiritual joy and divine communion; in the next world—eternal life in the progress of the divine spirit realities of the Paradise Father." (1593)

"Spiritual destiny is dependent on faith, love, and devotion to truth—hunger and thirst for righteousness—the wholehearted desire to find God and to be like him." (1739)

"The forces of the spiritual world will not coerce man; they allow him to go the way of his own choosing." (1802)

"Jesus is the spiritual lens in human likeness which makes visible to the material creature Him who is invisible. He is your elder brother who, in the flesh, makes known to you a Being of infinite attributes whom not even the celestial hosts can presume fully to understand. But all of this must consist in the personal experience of the individual believer. God who is spirit can be known only as a spiritual experience. God can be revealed to the finite sons of the material worlds, by the divine Son of the spiritual realms, only as a Father. You can know the Eternal as a Father; you can worship him as the God of universes, the infinite Creator of all existences." (1857)

"And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace." (2054)

"The teachers of this new religion are now equipped with spiritual weapons. They are to go out to conquer the world with unfailing forgiveness, matchless good will, and abounding love. They are equipped to overcome evil with good, to vanquish hate by love, to destroy fear with a courageous and living faith in truth." (2064)

"The Master's entire life was consistently conditioned by this living faith, this sublime religious experience. This spiritual attitude wholly dominated his thinking and feeling, his believing and praying, his teaching and preaching. This personal faith of a son in the certainty and security of the guidance and protection of the heavenly Father imparted to his unique life a profound endowment of spiritual reality." (2088)

[The purpose in providing these quotations is to aid readers in gaining understanding of what is meant by those difficult to define concepts, "spiritual meanings and values"—the truth being that such are the only components of our mortal existence that survive with us to the next stage of existence. Lest we do the same, it is also worth noting that Jesus had great difficulty in teaching the apostles spiritual concepts for they invariably turned them into rules to be obeyed.]
