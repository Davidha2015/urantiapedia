# On Divine Truth

All finite knowledge and creature understanding are relative. Information and intelligence, gleaned from even high sources, is only relatively complete, locally accurate, and personally true.

Physical facts are fairly uniform, but truth is a living and flexible factor in the philosophy of the universe. Evolving personalities are only partially wise and relatively true in their communications. They can be certain only as far as their personal experience extends. That which apparently may be wholly true in one place may be only relatively true in another segment of creation.

Divine truth, final truth, is uniform and universal, but the story of things spiritual, as it is told by numerous individuals hailing from various spheres, may sometimes vary in details owing to this relativity in the completeness of knowledge and in the repleteness of personal experience as well as in the length and extent of that experience.

While the laws and decrees, the thoughts and attitudes, of the First Great Source and Center are eternally, infinitely, and universally true; at the same time, their application to, and adjustment for, every universe, system, world, and created intelligence, are in accordance with the plans and technique of the Creator Sons as they function in their respective universes, as well as in harmony with the local plans and procedures of the Infinite Spirit and of all other associated celestial personalities.

# Science in The Urantia Book

A mystery of inexplicable prophesy being compounded by inexplicable error.

Introduction

This article aspires to demonstrate that there is truly prophetic material of a scientific nature in the Urantia Papers (received 1935) that cannot be fobbed off as lucky guess. Supposedly the authors of these Papers were extra-terrestrials. If they have demonstrated they had knowledge unavailable to us earthlings, perhaps they were!! Herein, you are introduced to samples of the prophetic science. However the real significance of these Papers is in their  “contemplation of  the spiritual realities and universe values of eternal meanings”—which is quite independent of their science content and the status of their authors.

These Papers also contain error, most of which is in accord with having being provided purely as a framework in which to think about the cosmology of creation. (Paper 115, Section 1 ) But some of the errors are difficult to place in that category. For example the Papers give the surface temperature of the sun as a little less than 6000 degrees F. But current measurements show the photosphere as having the lowest temperature at about 10,800 F. The chromosphere, at 18,000 F, is what many consider to be the surface. From there, the corona temperature rapidly increases up into the millions of degrees. And the Papers give the core as at 35,000 F whereas modern science puts it at 27,000 F.

Remarkably, the Papers provided correct information for events such as the beginnings of the solar system at 4.5 billion years ago, continental drift beginning 750 million years ago, radii of the electron and proton, etc., long before science could confirm them—but made a less than remarkable job of explaining the origin of our earth-moon system and the oceans of the earth.

The purpose of this and the following article is to gain some understanding of why it is so.

Particle physics—two remarkable prophecies: The radii of the electron and proton.

In a textbook published at an American university in 1934 entitled, “The Architecture of the Universe,” physicist W.F.G. Swann wrote: “The mass of the electron is so small that if you should magnify all masses so that the electron attains a mass of one tenth of an ounce, that one tenth of an ounce would, on the same scale of magnification, become as heavy as the earth.”

The words of Swann were reproduced in Paper 42, Section 6 but with the comparison obviously deliberately changed from mass to volume. It reads:

“If the mass of matter should be magnified until that of an electron equaled one tenth of an ounce, then were size to be proportionately magnified, the volume of such an electron would become as large as that of the earth.”

Taking the rest mass of the electron at 9.1 x 10-28 g, 0.1 ounce as 2.8 g, the radius of the earth as 6.4 x 106 m and putting k as the magnification constant, then:
k x 9.1 x 10-28  = 2.8……..1, and so

k = 3.1 x 10-27…………….2

As the radius of the electron (Re) x k is said to be equal to the radius of the earth, we have:
Re x k = 6.4 x 106……….3
And substituting for k in (3), we get the electron radius:

Re = 2 x 10-21 m ………...4

At the time of receipt of the Urantia Papers and up until the 1990's this made no sense. Many physicists treated the electron as a dimensionless point so at best its radius would be half the Planck length of 10-35 m. Others, by a process of circuitous reasoning, assigned it a radius of 5 x 10-15 m.

The statement remained  nonsensical until the 1990's when Nobel prize winner, Hans Dehmelt, found a way to confine a single electron to a trap semi-permanently. This achievement allowed actual measurements to be made that assigned the radius of the electron to fall into the range of 10-19 m to 10-22 m.

This new estimate was noticed by physicist Stefan Talqvist, a Urantia Book student who had previously checked the calculation using the Urantia Paper's version of Swann's earlier work. A few years later at Dehmelt's laboratory, refining of their techniques allowed them to settle for the electron radius being in the order of 10-22 m, so even closer to the 2 x 10-21 that is calculated for the Urantia Papers modified version of Swann's comparison.

What are the chances that these figures are coincidental, that the correspondence came about through accident or guesswork alone? Let's be conservative and consider only the order of magnitude. The possible range could extend to the Planck length of  10-35 m, so approximately a 25-30 fold range, with the chances of a close guess roughly at one in twenty five. But there was a second part to Swann's comparison that went:

“Then we have the proton—the fundamental unit of positive charge—a thing 1800 times as heavy as the electron, but 1800 times smaller in size, so that if you should magnify it to the size of a pin's head, that pin's head would, on the same scale of magnification, attain a diameter equal to that of the earth's orbit around the sun.”

[Note: Swann's estimate of the size of the proton as 1800 times smaller than the electron came from using r = e2/mc2, where e is the charge of the electron. The charge to mass ratio for the electron was known accurately by the early 1900 period. The charge was determined by Millikan in 1909. Its mass was then determined as 9.11 x 10-28 g.]

The Urantia Paper's author did not use this equation, changing the comparison to:

“If the volume of a proton—eighteen hundred times as heavy as an electron—should be magnified to the size of the head of a pin, then, in comparison, a pin's head would attain a diameter equal to that of the earth's orbit around the sun.”
Stefan Talqvist was again responsible for doing the calculations and drawing attention to this remarkable piece of prophetic material in the Papers.

Taking the radius of the Earth's orbital around the sun as 1.5 x 1014 mm and the radius of the pinhead as 1 mm, the magnification factor (k) is obtained by dividing the Earth's orbital radius by the pinhead radius, so 1.5 x 1014 / 1.0, which is 1.5 x 1014 (k)

The radius of the proton times the magnification factor (k) is equal to the radius of the pinhead, hence:
Proton radius x 1.5 x 1014 = pinhead radius (1.0 mm), so
Proton radius = 1.0 /1.5 x 1014, which is 6.7 x 10-15 mm, or 6.7 x 10-18m.

The classical radius for the proton was given as 0.85 x 10-15m so again the Urantia Paper's comparison looked to be nonsensical.

In later years it was realized that the proton consisted of three subunits called quarks and this component accounts for only about 50% of the proton's measured momentum, the remainder being accounted for by virtual particles that flip in and out from the vacuum. The current estimate of what is now termed the Bohr radius, a measurement of the 'real' part of the proton was given in Physics Today of November 1993, as 7.7 x 10-18m.—the same order of magnitude as that for the Urantia Paper's estimate.

Again using order of magnitude to compare the figures, the range for the proton may be about three to five orders less. If we set round figures for both, 25 for the electron and 20 for the proton, then the chances for guessing both comes out at one chance in about 500. Which also means that there are 499 ways to be wrong and illustrates that being right is so much more difficult that being wrong. Even at the 0.05 probability level, there are nineteen ways to be wrong for every one of being right.

When we take into consideration that Swann's details were deliberately modified in both estimates in order that they produce these results, it becomes impossible to support the notion that this was simply a lucky guess. Any rational interpretation must surely allow that it is a most remarkable prophesy of what our concepts for these parameters would be as we turn the corner into the twenty-first century.

Astrophysics—more prophecies: Neutrinos, Neutron Stars, and Black Holes

“In large suns when hydrogen is exhausted and gravity contraction ensues, if such a body is not sufficiently opaque to retain the internal pressure of support for the outer gas regions, then a sudden collapse occurs. The gravity-electric changes give origin to vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential, and such particles readily escape from the solar interior, thus bringing about the collapse of a gigantic sun within a few days.” (Paper 41, Section 9)

At the time of receipt of the Urantia Papers (1935), it was generally believed that the destiny for large stars well in excess of the size of our sun was to blow off their outer layers by a series of explosions until they could retire in comfort as a white dwarf, the same destiny as expected for our own sun. Names for neutron stars, neutrinos, and black holes had not even been invented and all were, at best, figments of the imagination.

The concept of a particle with no properties, hence one that would be impossible to ever detect, was proposed by leading physicist, Wolfgang Pauli, as a result of the inability of experimentalists to account for mass-energy that disappeared during radioactive beta decay. During subsequent years this became a serious enough problem so that in 1953, Cowan and Reines began experiments using a fission reactor to try to detect Pauli's undetectable particle. Success did not come until 1956, when R.R. Davis was able to detect its antiparticle, what is now called the anti-neutrino.

This discovery ensured that neutrinos did actually exist. However the neutrino itself was not finally detected until 1965 when they were identified coming from the sun using huge perchloroethylene tanks buried far underground.1 The neutrino is now recognized as the particle referred to as “vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential” that are capable of escaping from the interior of an exhausted large star undergoing gravitational collapse.

That the above description, as given in the Urantia Papers, is an accurate description of what is now called a supernova, is indisputable. Yet the theoretical basis for such explosions was not laid until 19572, but even then the neutrino was not implicated as the means by which the energy of the explosion could escape so readily. This is perhaps more easily  comprehended when we realize that light energy generated in the interior of such stars may take a million years or more to reach its surface. The neutrino, because of its inertness, makes that very same journey in a few seconds.

The concept of a supernova was first mooted by Zwicky and Baade in 1933 as an explanation for about half a dozen unexplained gigantic explosions that had been observed by astronomers. However the idea that they could arise from the collapse of large stars had no theoretical back-up. Zwicky calculated that about ten percent of the mass of the star might be lost this way. In his book on black holes3, physicist K.S. Thorne states that Zwicky knew nothing about the possible role of “little neutral particles” being released in the implosion of a large star. Instead he had attributed the entire mass-energy loss to cosmic rays. Zwicky's idea that a supernova-type collapse could occur was ridiculed by many and was also strongly opposed in 1939 by the most prominent physicist of the time, Albert Einstein, as well as the most prominent astronomer, Sir Arthur Eddington.

According to eminent Russian astrophysicist, Igor Novikov, no searches in earnest for neutron stars or black holes were attempted by astronomers before the 1960's. He says, “It was tacitly assumed that these objects were far too eccentric and most probably were the fruits of theorists' wishful thinking…at any rate, if they existed, then they could not be detected.4”

The opportunity to confirm the release of neutrinos during a supernova explosion occurred in 1987 when a supernova, visible to the naked eye, was observed in the Large Magellanic Cloud that neighbors our Milky Way galaxy. Calculations indicated that this supernova, dubbed SN1987A, should give rise to a neutrino burst at a density of 50 billion per square centimeter when it finally reached the earth. This neutrino burst, lasting just 12 seconds, was observed in the huge neutrino detectors at Kamiokande in Japan and also at Fairport, Ohio.

Thus SN 1987A provided a remarkable confirmation of the general picture of neutron star formation developed over the last fifty years. Importantly it also confirmed that the Urantia Paper got its facts right long before its “little neutral particle” was discovered and also long before the concept of neutrino-yielding supernovas achieved respectability.

# Geophysics—further prophecies: Continental Drift and Age of the Solar System

Image here

“There is a curious parallel history between the histories of black holes and continental drift. Evidence for both was already non-ignorable by 1916, but both ideas were stopped in their tracks for half a century by a resistance bordering on the irrational…but [resistance to] both began to crumble around 1960.” (Werner Israel, quoted in Thorne1)

“...disbelief (in continental drift) was so strong that it often bordered on indignation. One of the strongest opponents was the British geophysicist Sir Harold Jeffreys, who spent years attempting to demonstrate that continental drift is impossible because the strength of the mantle should be far greater than any conceivable driving force….It was in North America, however, that opposition to Wegener's ideas was vigorous to the point of excess and very nearly unanimous….Wegener was attacked from virtually every possible vantage point, his paleontological evidence attributed to land bridges, the similarity of strata on both sides of the Atlantic called into question, the fit of Atlantic shores declared inaccurate, and his very competence doubted.”2

The idea of continental drift was mooted in the 19th century and first put forward as a comprehensive theory by Wegener in 1912. It was not well accepted, often being classified as pseudoscience. For example Rollin T. Chamberlin, a leading American geologist, wrote in 1928 just 6 years prior to receipt of the Urantia Papers: “Wegener's theory in general is of the footless type…It plays a game in which there are few restrictive rules…” Chamberlin then listed 18 points that he considered were destructive of the drift hypothesis and began his book with, “Can we call geology a science when there exists such a difference of opinion in fundamental matters as to make it possible for such a theory to run wild?”

In the light of such opposition one must wonder what would have caused the authors of the Urantia Papers to base the whole of their report on the evolution of continents and life on this planet upon the truth of continental drift—unless they had access to some special source of knowledge.

Moreover they were not simply following Wegener's version of drift. Wegener began his story with a single continent that he called Pangea that commenced to break up in the order of 200 million years ago. The story presented in the Papers commenced with a single continent that commenced to break up 750 million years ago. Wegener's views prevailed until around 1970 when some geologists began to voice a different opinion which is reported in a book entitled “Genesis” published in 19822. In this, it was proposed that there may have been a pre-existing continent, a Pangea 1, roughly 600 million years ago that had broken up into four new continents by about 450 million years ago, at the end of the Ordovician age. Then, about 250 million years later, these continents were thought to have converged to form Pangea 2 which quickly broke up again as proposed by Wegener. Variations on this theme have continued to appear and were pulled together in 1995 in a review article4 proposing the breakup of a pre-Cambrian supercontinent named Rodinia around 750 million years—exactly coincidental with the time given by the Urantia Papers.

There are other features of the Urantia Papers' story of our planet that are quite remarkable. Remembering the fierce opposition against continental drift that existed during time of receipt and publication of the Papers, their authors nevertheless associated the collision of the continental land mass and the oceanic floor with the formation of “the whole vast north and south mountain range extending from Alaska down through Mexico to Cape Horn.” (Paper 60, Section 3) The collision of tectonic plates and subduction of the oceanic plate is now accepted as a major component of the forces involved in mountain building in areas like the west coast of the Americas.

The Papers also tell of features such as land bridges connecting Australia, and the Antarctic continent with South America and South Africa that would have allowed primitive placental (marsupial) animals that flourished 50 million years ago to move between these continents.

The presence of marsupial fossils in Oligocene strata (about 35 to 40 million years old) in Australia and in America in the Cretaceous strata dating as far back as 65 million years ago, together with the recent discovery of marsupial fossils on Seymour Island in Antarctica provide remarkable evidence for statements (Paper 61, Sections 1,2 ) about the ancestors of Australia's kangaroos and the land bridges of 35 to 45 million years ago. Yet when the Papers were written in the 1930's, geologists or paleontologists who supported the notion of continental drift would have been labeled as mavericks. All of which raises the question of why the authors of the Urantia Papers would have written such material except they possessed knowledge unavailable on Urantia.

Radiometric chemistry: Age of the Solar System

At the beginning of Paper 57 in which the breakup up of a supercontinent and continental drift is introduced, there is another remarkable snippet of information. In this Paper we are told that the beginning of our solar system occurred 4.5 billion years ago. Until the mid-1950's no firm evidence existed that could confirm or deny such a statement, a range being given from about six thousand years by Creationists to six billion or more by cosmologists. The first radiometric dating of meteoric material was performed in 1955 by Claire Patterson who studied the lead isotopes in chondritic meteorite material. The result indicated an age of about 4.5 billion years as given in the Urantia Paper of 1934/5. This remains as the accepted age at 2001 AD.

Comments

There is absolutely no way that in 1955, the printing plates of The Urantia Book (published 1955) could have been altered to accommodate Dr Patterson's work. For starters it would have been foolish to do so for there was no certainty that the dating of a chondritic meteorite gave the correct age for the solar system. Secondly, the making of a metal printing plate was a time consuming and expensive business. For The Urantia Book, each circular plate was cast so as to turn out sixteen pages with each turn of the press.5  Lastly, in 1955 a considerable group of people was both studying the Papers and checking for possible typographic errors that could be corrected in a later printing. It would have been impossible to accomplish such a change in secrecy. At this stage of proceedings any attempt to make substantial changes to the plates would have resulted in a furor and would have been well known throughout the Urantia movement..

So much of the story of our planet in the Urantia Papers relates to the story of continental drift that if the drift story had turned out to be a fiasco, The Urantia Book would surely have disappeared from circulation many years ago. Except that they had access to privileged  information, the authors went out on a long light limb when they opted for continental drift—and they embraced it so whole heartedly that they located themselves at the very end of that limb.

However, a word of caution. The chances of correct guessing for this small selection of prophetic material are so slight that only a totally shut mind would reject their significance. But the reason for including prophetic material is not so obvious. In terms of what was known in the 1930's period, the cosmology content of the Papers was adequate and provided for a conceptual “universe frame in which to think” (Paper 115, Section 1) that was suitable for the next thirty or so years. Today it is outdated and will become increasingly so. The good side of this is that it will ensure a label of infallibility and authority cannot be sustained—for even those with a reasonable level of high school education will recognize the outdated state of its cosmology. The bad side is that many may turn away from the book without giving it due consideration and thus miss out on its genuinely valuable religious and spiritual contributions.

So why was prophetic material included? The most likely reason appears to be that once the cosmology became outdated and recognized as such, those who might otherwise reject the work without ever looking for themselves nevertheless could be provided with an incentive to ignore the error and read the Papers for what they were intended—their intrinsic spiritual and religious value.

# Prophetic Science in the Urantia Papers—Discussion

Although the Urantia Papers contain a considerable amount of science related material, most of it is really a background setting for the important aspects of these Papers—those concerned with the religious and spiritual values of mankind. Whether or not this background setting ranks as infallible truth is not as important as that it provides a framework in which we can think about that which is ultimately of extreme importance to mankind—why are we here and what is our destiny?

Nevertheless any rational thinker must admit that the Papers do present some truly prophetic scientific material having aspects that were unknown to human scientists at the time of receipt in 1935—as well as some that remained unknown until long afterwards. Contrasting with this, the Papers also contain much material that was either outdated, soon to be outdated, or simply erroneous. Obviously the authors of these Papers were amazingly knowledgeable, highly intelligent, and display extraordinary wisdom. Their strange way of presentation must have been considered and deliberate. Our question is why?

Historically, few of the early readers of the Papers were qualified to judge the quality of science in the book. Hence most, swayed by the exalted status claimed for the authors but despite denials in the Papers themselves, assumed revelation must automatically imply infallibility.

Since those early days, many readers have discovered that the science content of the Papers includes both remarkable prophesy and serious error. At times skeptics have leveled the criticism that if enough random guesses are made, some will be correct by sheer chance. However there are instances in these Papers where the probability of being right or wrong through random guesswork can be rationally assessed—and in enough instances to cause us to conclude that  the “through guesswork” alternative is not really a valid option. That leaves an unanswered question—what is the explanation for this strange mix of prophetic science and sometimes ridiculously wrong material?

The history of the Urantia Papers as provided by the convener of the so-called Contact Commission, Dr W. S. Sadler1, and by others2,3, tells of distinct phases during the receipt of the Papers. The first, a preparatory stage, commenced perhaps as early as 1905 and continued through until 1924; a second, in which questions were asked and new Papers received, was from 1925 until 1935 when the final version of the Papers was pronounced to be complete; a third period lasted until 1942 during which some minor modifications were made, the contract to print was signed and the galley proofs checked; there then followed a lengthy and unexplained period terminating in 1955 when the book was finally published. During this final period the completed printing plates remained in the strong room of the publishers, R. R. Donnelly and Sons, awaiting instructions to print.

If we accept Dr Sadler as our sole authority, all of the Papers of Parts 1, 2, and 3 were received through a single unidentified person, a patient of Dr's William and Lena Sadler, who either spoke or wrote during a disturbed period of sleep of which he was quite unconscious. Part 4 of the book, the Life of Jesus of Nazareth, may have had a different origin though the evidence for this is conflicting.2 Parts 1, 2, and 3 were completed in 1934, and Part 4 in 1935.

For our present purpose, the period during which the Papers were received is our main interest. Lasting about ten years, according to Dr Sadler it commenced in a contact experience when a “visitor,” speaking through the sleeping subject, answered a question with these words, “If only you knew what you are in contact with you would not ask such trivial questions. You would rather ask such questions as might elicit answers of supreme value to the human race.”

Later that night one of Dr. Sadler's group exclaimed: “Now they have asked for it—let us give them questions that no human being can answer1.”

A group called the Forum was then organized, the arrangement being that Papers would be received only as answers to specific questions from the Forum. Questions were posed, collected by Dr Sadler, placed in an arranged location, and an answer later received through the medium of the “sleeping subject.”

One of these Papers contained material important to our quest for understanding the error content of the Papers. It needs to be read in the light of the aim of the Forum members that they should ask questions that no human being could answer.
"Because your world is generally ignorant of origins, even of physical origins, it has appeared to be wise from time to time to provide instruction in cosmology. And always has this made trouble for the future. The laws of revelation hamper us greatly by their proscription of the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge. Any cosmology presented as a part of revealed religion is destined to be outgrown in a very short time. Accordingly, future students of such a revelation are tempted to discard any element of genuine religious truth it may contain because they discover errors on the face of the associated cosmologies therein presented.

“Mankind should understand that we who participate in the revelation of truth are very rigorously limited by the instructions of our superiors…within a few short years many of our statements regarding the physical sciences will stand in need of revision in consequence of additional scientific developments and new discoveries. These new developments we even now foresee, but we are forbidden to include such humanly undiscovered facts in the revelatory records. Let it be made clear that revelations are not necessarily inspired.” (from Paper 101, Section 4.)

From the first paragraph we note that the laws of revelation “proscribe the impartation of unearned or premature knowledge.” In this Paper it is also stated that in some cases information could be supplied to fill vital missing gaps in otherwise earned knowledge. Perhaps this was what sanctioned the inclusion of prophetic material—despite the proscription against the provision of unearned knowledge.

The goal of Forum members to pose questions that human beings could not answer is in conflict with what are described as the laws of revelation—those proscribing provision of unearned knowledge. We might ponder what would have occurred if the answer to each such question had been, “Sorry, we are not permitted to answer.” The revelators, whoever they might be, were in the hot seat. Failure to answer probably would have resulted in collapse of the project and loss of twenty years of preparatory work.

If we believe what we find in the Papers themselves, a betrayal of trust on the part of the revelators is unthinkable. Celestial beings of their status simply do not break the rules. In most cases what they appear to have done is to provide the most up-to-date knowledge available in the early 1930's that came reasonably close to being an answer to the question—even though it might later prove to be erroneous. In some cases, there was no suitable response available and rather than responding, “Sorry we cannot answer,” fill material was used that would pass muster for many years into the future but could eventually become seriously wrong.

In the long run this served to solve two problems. Granting the high status of the authors, they would probably anticipate the inevitability of many Forum members and later readers acquiring a fundamentalist attitude to the revelation comparable with that of biblical fundamentalists. But the inclusion of what would later become blatantly erroneous answers could act to prevent those at a higher level of rationality and scientific knowledge from according an infallibility status to the Papers. It is also possible that the inclusion of the prophetic material had the deliberate purpose of seeking to attract the attention of those receptive individuals whose major interests would find common ground with the Papers because of their intrinsic spiritual and religious value—despite the erroneous cosmology.

The revelators covered themselves by stating what they were doing in a number of places with comments such as “the cosmology of these Papers is not inspired.” Up to and even beyond the 1930's, for most people that word “cosmology” had a far broader meaning than astronomy alone. Cosmology was a traditional branch of metaphysics and was even inclusive of the famous cosmological argument of Thomas Aquinas about the existence of God. And their words “not inspired” later received a meaning that is less than infallible in the authors' statement, “The creature may crave infallibility, but only the Creators possess it.” (Paper 159, Section 4) In actuality none of the listed authors of the Papers were of “Creator” status.

There is a second and important reason why this revelation could not be both consistent and infallible. The Papers state, “As to eternal survival, God has decreed the sovereignty of the material and mortal will and that decree is absolute.” (Paper 5, Section 6)  And, “ the portal of eternity opens only to the freewill choice of the free sons of the God of free will.” Furthermore, the Papers also state that faith alone will pass you through that portal. (Paper 140, Section 2)
An authoritative and infallible revelation provides a certainty and an authority that is incompatible with human beings having free will choice. For, as has been stated, “If we had reason for faith, then it would not be faith at all, it would be logic. Faith can only be unreasonable.” (Appleyard4)

Elsewhere we find: “Uncertainty with security is the essence of the Paradise adventure—uncertainty in time and in mind, uncertainty as to the events of the unfolding Paradise ascent; security in spirit and in eternity, security in the unqualified trust of the creature son in the divine compassion and infinite love of the Universal Father…” (Paper 111, Section 7)

For example, the Urantia Papers state that our eternal universe career is dependent upon the goal of our freewill decisions eventually becoming coincidental with God's will. To reject that as our goal is to sentence ourselves to “become as if we had never been.” (Paper 2, Section 3) So do we really have free will? Only if we are uncertain about the veracity of these conditional statements.

In reality God had no option but to ensure that “uncertainty with security is the essence of the Paradise adventure.” His alternative? To have created us as robots lacking in free will. Realization of this truth eliminates those puerile arguments about good and evil. We humans are totally responsible for all deliberate evil. And accidental evil is the unavoidable and inevitable result of giving free will to imperfect beings.

Thus the authors of these Urantia Papers also had no option but to find ways and means of preventing their revelation from becoming an infallible security blanket for those whose faith was not yet sufficiently advanced to accept the free will offered to them by the God of free will.

“They would not lie to us” is the cry we hear from those who, in their insecurity, cling to fundamentalism. But the revelators have explained very carefully and very explicitly what they were doing:

“No revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. All other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, transient, and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space. While such admissions as this may possibly detract from the immediate force and authority of all revelations, the time has arrived on Urantia when it is advisable to make such frank statements, even at the risk of weakening the future influence and authority of this, the most recent of the revelations of truth to the mortal races of Urantia.” (Paper 92, Section 4)

A further consideration is the stated hope of the authors that their offering will help to catalyze the metamorphosis of Christianity from a religion of authority, one that is largely dependent on the infallibility or near infallibility ascribed to the Gospels and apostolic letters of the New Testament, to a religion of the spirit that discovers its authority and meaning in the  personal relationships of individual Christians with their indwelling spirit of Deity. Religion of the spirit, as described in the Urantia Papers (Paper 155, Sections 5 & 6), could never be either authoritarian or infallible.

"Ecclesiasticism is at once and forever incompatible with that living faith, growing spirit, and firsthand experience of the faith-comrades of Jesus in the brotherhood of man in the spiritual association of the kingdom of heaven. The praiseworthy desire to preserve traditions of past achievement often leads to the defense of outgrown systems of worship. The well-meant desire to foster ancient thought systems effectually prevents the sponsoring of new and adequate means and methods designed to satisfy the spiritual longings of the expanding and advancing minds of modern men. Likewise, the Christian churches of the twentieth century stand as great, but wholly unconscious, obstacles to the immediate advance of the real gospel—the teachings of Jesus of Nazareth.

“'The kingdom of God is within you' was probably the greatest pronouncement Jesus ever made, next to the declaration that his Father is a living and loving spirit.” (Paper 195, Section10)

# Error in the Urantia Papers.

Our previous discussion has presented lines of reasoning that may shed light upon the many occurrences of errors in the Urantia Papers. That these errors do constitute a mystery derives from the observation by so many that the authors of these Papers had an excellent, highly specialized knowledge in multiple areas of science, as well as in religion, the Bible, theology and philosophy.

Because of this, it is incomprehensible that such authors would undertake the enormous labor of writing a 2000-page book and knowingly include a multitude of potential sources of error—then present it as an epochal revelation in the full knowledge that only a minor error or two could discredit the whole of their work.

No suggestion has ever come forward linking the name of any academic with authorship of these Papers. Statistical analysis using the well-accredited method of Mosteller and Wallace demonstrated multiple authorship for these Papers and also excluded the possibility of  Dr Sadler himself as being a major contributor.

The best known 'errors' in the Papers are the distance to the Andromeda galaxy, the “instantaneous disruption” of elements higher than the one-hundredth, the planet Mercury always turning the same face to the sun, and the human chromosome number. Regardless of how individuals may view them, the fact remains that, taken at face value, they will always present to new, science-oriented readers as wrong. Among such, the more knowledgeable may recognize these and other errors as views commonly held in the mid-1930's, since found to be incorrect.

There is a general agreement that the probable direct source of these Papers was a single patient of Drs. William and Lena Sadler who apparently spoke and wrote while asleep but had no consciousness of doing so once he awakened.1 The fact remains today that there is no realistic competing suggestion.

Allegedly, the sources for this material originated elsewhere than from this planet. The content of the communications was sufficiently fascinating to arouse the interest of the recipients—but it also aroused their natural desire to test and expose the credentials of the alleged sources. Thus, when an invitation was given to submit questions that should be of “supreme value to the human race,” the opportunity was seized to ask questions “that no human being could answer.”2

1. Possible error sources. Not answering the unanswerable.

Unknown to the questioners, their stated intention of asking questions no human could answer was in conflict with a “universe rule for revelation that proscribes the provision of unearned knowledge.” (Paper 101, Section 4)

As stated previously, posing such questions for the proposed purpose placed the source authors in a quandary. They were being tested. Allowing the veracity of their claims as being of celestial origin, to tender an excuse on why they could not answer would almost certainly engender the conclusion that their claims were false—and this would nullify their previous fifteen to twenty years of preparatory work. But if they complied they would be forced to break what, for them, was an unbreakable universe rule.

It appears that their compromise was, for the most part, to supply plausible responses that would be outdated at some future time. Alternatively, they sometimes supplied prophetic information as covered by the terms of two codicils in Paper 101 permitting them to provide key or lost information when considered necessary. In various other Papers they informed receptive readers of their policies.

2. Possible error sources. Cancellation of free will

Besides the universe rule against providing unearned knowledge, there was a second possible reason why these celestial authors could not comply with requests for information that “no human being could possible answer.” To do so would almost certainly lead to their responses ultimately being credited as divinely authoritative, hence infallible. Throughout these Papers we find it declared that our God-given free will is sacrosanct. Having certain knowledge of a divine being and of what that being might absolutely require from us cancels the grant of unconditional free will. Uncertainty is an essential requirement for this grant of free will to be truly free.

3. Possible error sources. Failure to understand that Part 4, “The Life of Jesus” was the whole of the revelation intended for actual publication

There is yet another possible explanation for the error content of these Papers, one that some believe is the most likely reason for its existence. It relates to Part 4, the Life of Jesus of Nazareth, being the real revelation. This implies that the other three parts of The Urantia Book were derived from material accumulated during the establishment and training of an organization that was nurtured so as to ensure publication and distribution of the real revelation.

Since none of us has ever been a celestial being (that we know of) charged with the responsibility of delivering an updated repeat of the revelation by Jesus of Nazareth about the true nature of God, we are quite ignorant of the factors involved and the degree of difficulty attaching to various phases of the task.

The task appears to have had the following components. Find a way to get the revelation into an earth language, find and train people who will accept it, then foster a larger group who will eventually form an organization to print, publish, and distribute the revelation and publicize its existence.

The first component required a choice of country and language. Considering the chaotic situation after world war one and the depression era that followed, it is not surprising that the United States was the country of choice. Hence English had to be the language of choice.

We know nothing of how the recipient, the one generally called the sleeping subject, was chosen nor what his qualities would need to have been other than not being excessively perturbed by the events to follow.

A group then had to be found to receive the revelation and transcribe it into suitable form for copying. These two units had to be brought together in a way that would ensure amicable cooperation. Amazingly, Dr William S. Sadler was chosen to lead this phase. Subsequent history demonstrates the remarkable abilities of those who made these choices.

The first contact with the Sadlers may have been as early as 1906.1 In 1909 William S. Sadler was still a staunch associate and disciple of Seventh Day Adventist guru, Ellen G. White. He was a conservative evangelical Christian, a believer in the infallibility of the Bible, and in the imminent return of Christ. In that year he published a book entitled Soul Winning Texts 2 consisting of selected quotations from both the Old and New Testaments that were designed to help the sinner to, “see the light.” Examination of that book reveals Sadler as the most unlikely looking candidate that could be imagined for the role of playing midwife to a new revelation—and definitely not one with any potential to play herald to the rebirth of the original spiritual religion of Jesus of Nazareth.

The people around Sadler who became close associates in this affair were of the same ilk. His wife, Lena, also was a Seventh Day Adventist. The two attended medical school together, first at Stanford and then at SDA Medical Mission School, Illinois. Both graduated with MD certification from the State of Illinois. Later, Sadler changed his interests from surgery to psychiatry, going to Europe to study for a year in Vienna with Freud. On return to the USA, the Sadlers established a practice in Chicago.

Possibly in 1908, the Sadlers were temporarily housed in a furnished apartment while waiting for their new residence to be prepared. Late one summer evening, a lady tenant knocked on their door and asked would they go downstairs with her because her sleeping husband was acting strangely but she could not awaken him.1 This was the first contact of the Sadlers with the “sleeping subject” subject who then remained their patient at least until 1935.

Rightly he was called the “sleeping subject” for though everything about him appeared normal, they were quite unable to awaken him. He did so, of his own accord, several hours later and quite unaware of anything being amiss. This strange behavior repeated itself several times then, on one such an occasion when he was observed to moisten his lips, Dr. Lena Sadler asked how he felt and a voice, not his own that his wife could recognize, answered it was a student from another planet on an observation visit. Sadler himself assumed this was some kind of automatic speaking produced from the subconscious of the patient.

The accounts of this and the long period ensuing until formation of the group called the Forum in 1925 are scanty and confusing. However it appears that despite the many intelligent and informative exchanges with all manner of “visitors” that occurred over these years, Sadler clung rigidly to his belief that he was observing a natural phenomenon originating completely from within the mind of his patient—though he does admit that their religious views were changed unconsciously but remarkably by these night time vigils over this long period.

The catalyst for the formation of the Forum appears to have been a test devised by Sadler who memorized fifty two questions (Sadler had one of those remarkable 'photographic' memories) that he intended to use to challenge the “voice” to read his mind. He was forestalled in doing this when the “voice” stated it was authorized to answer forty six of them. The reality of this event had the support of his wife Lena who was there when it is said to have happened.1 Shortly after this, the incident mentioned in the previous article occurred—the one that gave rise to the determination of the Forum group to “ask questions that no human being could answer 2.”

If we make the assumption that all of this is truth rather than fiction, the “celestials” had now succeeded in creating a nucleus to build upon for the next stage. However they had a real problem on their hands. Their update of the orthodox authoritative Christian version of Jesus' revelation, and its meaning, conflicted strongly with the spiritual view of the religion of Jesus that they wished to deliver.

Again granting their superhuman status, they would be likely to know that many attempts had been made in the theological institutions in the USA that trains the ministry to similarly modify Christian dogma. Over many years, such teaching had made little or no headway with Christian congregations. Even with those Christians who considered themselves liberal rather than fundamentalist, most still clung tenaciously to the authority of the Bible as if it were of divine origin. Few recruits to a new religion of the spirit would be likely to be found among practicing Christians.

Their solution to this problem included that for nigh on ten years, Jesus scarcely received a mention. This becomes obvious if we read Parts 1, 2, and 3. Over a ten year period they concentrated upon building a new and complex image of Deity that had at its center a Universal Father whose goodness, love, and mercy as our Father transcends his righteousness as our judge. This was a God whose spirit indwells each mortal being to establish a personal and individual relationship. It was also a God who loved all mankind unconditionally. The “celestials” taught these people a religion of the spirit, one in which no person could impose God's authority upon another, and belief automatically called forth the yielding of the fruit of the spirit in the lives of the believers.

With some of the Forum members, the “celestials” succeeded. At least they succeeded enough to generate the dedication and enthusiasm that would see their task completed. Upon which they gave them the real revelation, Part 4, the Life of Jesus—and then departed. It could be that the oft-quoted words, “Now you are on your own” belong here rather than later.  In this scenario, that incident occurred in 1935. All further contact with these superhuman beings then ceased and was never reestablished.

Continuing on with this scenario, the immediate result of the “you are on your own” decree was misunderstanding followed by confusion, uncertainty, and procrastination. What was either misunderstood or re-interpreted was that the “Life of Jesus” was the whole of the revelation. This was the only part they were required to print, publish, and distribute. But for ten years, this group of people had only possessed the content of Parts 1, 2, and 3. That was what they knew and cherished. It was what made them different from everybody else. It was what made them believe they were special, selected, chosen and unique. To now switch their loyalties and share their Jesus story with a billion Christians was not an attractive thought.

The pre-Forum group, the Sadlers and a few close associates that had become known as the “Contact Commission” were, in effect, an executive committee. If at first they had understood that the “Life of Jesus” was the real revelation, doubts soon entered their minds. They also realized they had no hope of maintaining the enthusiasm of the Forum group if they went ahead to publish Part 4 only.

Exactly when the decision was made to publish all of the Papers in single book form is unknown. Eventually Dr. Lena Sadler took control and commenced collecting the money needed for publication. As well, she arranged for the Papers to be organized into a form suitable for submission to a publisher to prepare a galley proof. But then, in 1939, she died. And the European war commenced.

The long illness and subsequent death of his wife from breast cancer took a very severe toll on Dr Sadler. However the Sadlers had an adopted daughter, Emma Christenson, and a son, Bill Sadler Jr., both now members of the Contact Commission. These two stepped into the breach and carried on with the arrangements set up by Dr. Lena.

By 1941, the first galley proof became available for checking. After checking and further proof reading the plates were cast, perhaps during 1942, but almost certainly by 1943. Pearl Harbor happened at the end of 1941.

At some time after 1935, and possibly after the death of Dr. Lena Sadler, a new supposed  contact with “celestials” occurred. One (perhaps more than one) of the Contact Commission flirted with what most of us call “channeling.” Some channeling occurs by listening to “voices” in the head. Others sit in front of a typewriter or computer and type whatever comes into their heads. Whatever the mechanics, the fact is that from the time it commenced until long after the book was published, supposed “messages” from celestials were used by the Contact Commission to impose authority and maintain enthusiasm. However just why publication of the book was delayed for twenty years remains an unsolved mystery.

Finally, in 2001 CE and despite much legal litigation, Part 4, “The Life of Jesus,” has been published and is in circulation as a single complete work, all accomplished  completely independently of the organization that was initially set up for that purpose.4

“All things work together for good in those who love the Lord.”

Parts 1, 2, and 3—Commentary

Besides Part 4, of particular interest and value to religionists and theologians are Papers 1-10 that refer to the nature of God and deity relationships including the Trinity, and Papers 100 to the end of Part 3 that expound upon religion in more general terms. Included are various “aspects” of the First Source and Center such as the transcendent Universal Father of infinity status and the Supreme Being, the God of Finite Reality. There is much in these Papers that would be of interest to process theologians and also to those who have an interest in the future of the Christian religion in the post-modern world.

Finale

The Urantia Papers present us with a much greater task than simply taking comfort from having them or being able to read them. In them we possess the most profound spiritual and religious truths ever to exist as a single unified collection on this planet—as well as being  one that is unexcelled for its quality of writing and its consistency. Hence, all revelation therein is self-authenticating.

This is true, independently of who wrote them or how they were written, or what else accompanies them. But like all truth, revelatory or otherwise, the responsibility for decision making about what is true, and what our obligations might be, belongs solely to the individual.

The truths in these Papers demand much.  Bearing the fruit of the spirit is their biggest ask. It is the big, big “why” for the Papers being here. And bearing that fruit is a must do.

“What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions.” How??

“Christianity has indeed done a great service for this world, but what is now most needed is Jesus. The world needs to see Jesus living again in the experience of spirit-born mortals who effectively reveal the Master to all men.”

We have the Papers—and the obligation.
