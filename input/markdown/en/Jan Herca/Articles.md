**GENERALITIES**

# The Jewish calendar on Jesus times

At the present time, most countries are governed by the so-called “Gregorian” calendar, which was established by Pope Gregory based, after making certain corrections, on the Julian calendar, in use since the year 46 BC, established by Julius Caesar, and that was the calendar of the Roman Empire at the time of Jesus.

The Master undoubtedly had to know this calendar and be familiar with it, since in one way or another it affected all the kingdoms subject to the rule of Rome. But perhaps the Roman calendar of the time of Jesus occupies us with another document.

What concerns us here is the Jewish calendar of the time of Jesus and its correlation with the Julian calendar, an important issue to know when festivals and important events of his life took place.

The Gospels and all the literature from the time of Jesus that we have do not allow us to pinpoint a single date of an event in the life of Jesus. The indications of the evangelists speak in general terms with reference to the beginning of some reign but they do not specify the exact date of the events with numbers. This situation means that neither the day Jesus was born, nor the day he died, nor the date of any important event in his life is known.

To further complicate matters, there is no unanimity among scholars as to what rules governed the Jewish luni-solar calendar of the time. Some experts propose a calendar that followed fixed and well-known rules. It is known that these rules were in use at the time of Maimonides, who lived between 1135 and 1204 of our era. But it is unknown if these rules were also in use at the time of Jesus, or if instead the calendar was governed by astronomical or even agricultural observations, and not by predefined rules.

## Basic concepts

To better understand how this calendar worked, let's clarify some basic concepts.

The Jewish calendar of that time, unlike our current one, which is solar, was governed by both lunar and solar cycles. That is, it was a luni-solar calendar.

The Earth revolves around the Sun approximately every 365 days. The Moon makes almost twelve full revolutions around the Earth while the Earth does it around the Sun. It only has 11 days left to complete twelve full revolutions.

It is easy to understand that since ancient times it has been a temptation to divide the solar year, the months, into twelve equal parts and to make these months coincide with the lunations. But the problem arises when we run into that 11-day lag every year.

To solve this problem, the Jewish calendar of the time of Jesus, like other calendars of the time also based on the Moon, used the method of inserting one more month every few years (a month called “embolismal”) to keep the solar and lunar cycles in sync, and making a few more adjustments to the total number of days in the year.

In the same way as in the Julian calendar (and later in our current calendar) one more day is added in leap years, in the Jewish calendar of the times of Jesus a full month was added every certain time intervals.

The rules of this calendar were then as follows:

* Every 19 years (known as the “Metonic cycle”) there were certain years that had 13 months. Researchers dispute which of these years were used at that time, but almost all evidence points to years 3, 6, 8, 11, 14, 17, and 19 of the cycle. The rest had 12 months.

* For certain religious holidays to fall as close as possible to certain astronomical events, some of those 19 years had to have one more day and others one day less. Specifically, something very important was that Easter fell after the vernal equinox. The fixation of these additions or subtractions to the number of days has divided the experts into two positions: the one that considers that some rules known as the “rules of postponement” (or _dechiyot_) were followed; and the opposite, which believes that these rules were not applied in the time of Jesus, but that subjective criteria were used (astronomical observations, observation of the moment in which the first fruits began to be ripe, the age of the lambs, etc.), set by the scribes and rabbis of the time.

Here we are not going to analyze each of these positions because they would take the explanations too far. Suffice it to say that all the determinations were aimed at the same purpose: to try to make the beginning of each year, the Jewish New Year, coincide with a very specific position of the Moon, known as _Molad_[^3], so that from year to year the lunar synchrony was perfect.

The _Molad_ is an average of the dates of the lunar conjunctions. In modern calendars, the astronomical conjunction of the Moon is designated as “new moon” and appears with a completely dark circle. As this conjunction takes place during the dark phase of the Moon, it is very difficult to determine the exact time it will occur and even the exact day. To add to the difficulty, the lunar cycles are not regular, but small fluctuations of the planets alter their cycle.

Today this determination is made by sophisticated calculation techniques made available to us by our superior astronomical knowledge, but at that time, everything had to be done experimentally based on crude observations. The “new moon” at that time was determined using the earliest possible visibility of the “crescent moon.” A minimum of 17.2 hours had to pass from the time of the astronomical “real” conjunction before the “crescent moon” could be seen. And even then, bad weather or other circumstances could alter these observations.

This inaccuracy in the calculation of the _Molad_, and the need for certain festivals to take place at the right time, make the “real” Jewish calendar of the times of Jesus a complete mystery that is difficult to solve.

Therefore, pending new discoveries and evidence, it seems that we can only guess about the dates on which the Jewish festivals occurred in the time of Jesus, and by deduction, the most important events of his life.

Perhaps one of the most discussed dates is that of his death. _The Urantia Book_ establishes this date as April 7, 30 AD, and this date is, curiously, one of those that experts consider as a hypothesis. They are based on indications in the Gospels that the Jewish passover, the year Jesus died crucified, took place on a Friday. The possibilities admit, among other years, this April 7, 30 AD.

Therefore, and given the current impossibility of scientifically opting for a specific date, it has been preferred to take April 7 as valid and make it coincide with Nisan 14, which is the first day of the Easter festival. There is a wide debate and controversy on this question of whether Jesus died the day before Nisan 14, or during Nisan 14. But perhaps this is the subject of another document.

It should be noted here that the Jewish days began with a lag of almost 18 hours with respect to our current days, since the Jews began to count the beginning of the day at sunset. The graph shows this gap and the moment of the crucifixion is marked.

<figure id= “Calendar_fig_1” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/fechas.png"></figure>

Some consulted calendars do not offer exactly this date for Nisan 14, but as has been explained, since everything is conjecture, an attempt has been made to develop a “possible” calendar that would fit this April 7 as Nisan 14.

## Procedure used

The calendar has been prepared as follows:

* The starting point has been the calendar based on the current postponement rules, which uses a traditional metonic cycle, making the years 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 18 of the cycle have twelve months. The months, in order from first to last, were called: Tishri, Heshvan, Kislev, Tevet, Shevat, Adar, Nisan, Iyar, Sivan, Tammuz, Ab, and Elul. The rest of the years of the cycle, the month of adar was lengthened by one day and another month called adar seni or second adar was added after it.

* The rule of making all months except Hesvan and Kislev a fixed length has also been used: Tishri was 30 days, Tevet 29, Shevat 30, Adar (“embolismal” years) 30, Adar (“common” years), or adar seni (“embolismal” years) 29, nisan 30, iyar 29, sivan 30, tammuz 29, ab 30 and elul 29. As you can see, it is easy to remember. Every odd month had 30 days and every even month had 29, except for heshvan and kislev (and not counting the adar of embolismal years). However, many experts in the subject are more inclined towards calendars where all the months were likely to have a variable number of days. It is easy to fall for the idea that already in the time of Jesus almost every month had a fixed length to make it easier for people to remember and use them, as is done today.

* Similarly, the length of the days of Heshvan and Kislev followed predefined rules, which created six different types of years.

	In common years there were three types:

	- a year with 353 days: here heshvan and kislev both had 29 days.

	- a year with 354 days: here heshvan had 29 days and kislev 30.

	- a year with 355 days: here both had 30 days.

	In embolismal years there were three types:

	- a year with 383 days: here heshvan and kislev both had 29 days.

	- a year with 384 days: here heshvan had 29 days and kislev 30.

	- a year with 385 days: here both had 30 days.

* The position of the Metonic cycle at the time of Jesus has also followed the current calendar, making AD 30 the beginning of the Jewish year 3791, which was the tenth year of the corresponding Metonic cycle.

| Year of the metonic cycle | Gregorian <br>Julian year | Jewish year ^1^ | Age of Jesus ^2^ | Days of the Jewish year ^3^ |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
4 | 24 | 3785 | 30 |
5 | 25 | 3786 | 31 | 355
6 | 26 | 3787 | 32 | __385__
7 | 27 | 3788 | 33 | 355
8 | 28 | 3789 | 34 | __383__
9 | 29 | 3790 | 35 | 355
10 | 30 | 3791 | | 

^1^ Year beginning in Gregorian fall.
^2^ Jesus' birthday that August.
^3^ Embolismal years in bold.

* Finally, the astronomical data provided by NASA's _Six Millennium Moon Events_,[^7] have been used to try to adjust the best possible start of each year with the lunar conjunction of September-October. It should be remembered that the Jewish calendar year began on Tishri 1, which usually fell in the early fall. Nisan 1 was the beginning of the religious calendar.

* Finally, the calendar has been adjusted so that April 7, AD 30 would be Nisan 14, 3790, shifting the rest of the calendar accordingly to maintain integrity in the number of days in the months. The result of this work is shown in this [Chronology of the life of Jesus](/en/article/Jan_Herca/Chronology_of_the_life_of_Jesus).

## Conclusions

We really cannot say for sure when the important festivals took place in the time of Jesus, and therefore many of the main events of his life, if we believe the Gospel accounts.

Surprisingly, the calendar offered here as a solution is never more than two days behind the calendar based on current postponements, and never more than two days behind the astronomical data calculated by NASA. This means that even if the calendar were not exact, a situation more than possible, the deviation would not be greater than two days, and preferably forward in time.

There are many factors that can blur the results: on the one hand, the astronomical calculations may not be completely accurate, and do not take into account all the lunar disturbances that affected the time; on the other, the observations made by the scribes and rabbis of that time could have been affected by cloudy days and bad weather; or it could even be the case that all the assumptions about the use of the current calendar were wrong and a very different one was actually used then.

What is clear is that any approximation must be guided by astronomical data, which can suffer deviations of several hours, but in no case more than a day. Therefore, we can say with some certainty that it is a fairly close calendar to the one that Jesus himself could use during his public life.

# Units of measurement in the time of Jesus

## Hebrew units

### Units of length

For the Hebrews the thumb is the first form of measurement and is called _etzbagh_ or “inch”. One thumb, moreover, is equivalent to six grains of barley, which was a very early way of counting grain. The thickness of the little finger was also another measure and was called _ziith_.

Four fingers were called _tefahl tefach_, plural _tefahiml tefachim_. This measurement is very frequently translated in the scriptures as “hand span”, but it must be understood that it is a short span. The Latin equivalent was the _palmus_, of four _digitus_ (7.3925 cm). There were other measures somewhat larger than this “short span” or “short span”. One was an outstretched palm measure called _zzit_ (_sit_), which was greater than four fingers. Another was the _zereth_, which is the distance between the tip of the thumb and the little finger with the palm extended to the maximum, and which came to be equal to twelve fingers, that is to say that the _zereth_ or “greater span” was equivalent to three “smaller spans”. ». The _zereth_, furthermore, was already significant because it was half a cubit ([Ez 43:13](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/43#v13), [Is 40:12](/en/Bible/Isaiah/40#v12),

Bricks used to be designated by the name of their length. There were two main types: a brick with a length of a “greater span” or _zereth_, and that dimension was called _lebana_, the width of this brick being half a _lebana_; then there was a square brick of one and a half «long spans» and this measure was called _ariahh_.

The _ama_ or _emah_, in the plural _emathaim_, or six _tefahiml_, which is often translated as “cubit”, is a very common measurement, mentioned in the measurements of Noah's ark ([Gn 6:15](/en/Bible/Genesis/6#v15)) and of the holy tabernacle (Ex 25ff). This _ama_, as can be seen, can be interpreted as two _zereth_ or two “longer palms”, and therefore equivalent to a cubit. Solomon's temple also always referred to this measure ([1 Kings 6ss](/en/Bible/1_Kings/6)). It was a widely used measure even in nations beyond the Hebrew.

However, an appreciation must be made about the “elbow”. There were two types of elbows: one was the “legal elbow” and the other the “common elbow”. The “cubit of the Law” was an exact measure, six _tephahhim_ or “lesser spans.” The “common cubit” encompassed only five “lesser spans,” that is, the usual length of a man's arm from the elbow to the tips of the fingers, and since every man might not have the same arm length, it was something variable.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/IMG_0001.png"></figure>
<em> Length units </em>

The elbow, whether it was legal or not, was a widely used measure in different parts of the world and adopted various names. Not only _amah_, _emah_, or _emoth_, but also _atsila_, which the Romans renamed to _axilla_, or else _gomed_, _gerima_, _garmida_, or _kal_. It has always been an easily reproducible measure and widely used everywhere.

A _cane_ or _kane_, plural _kanim_, was another larger measure. It was six _emoth_ and one _zereth_ long, that is, six and a half legal cubits, and was sometimes also called _zzalil_ ([Ez 40:3](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/40#v3); [Ez 41-42 ](/en/Bible/Ezekiel/41)).

The _kumah_ was the name given to the measure of the height of the upright human man, and it was estimated that there were about three _emoth_ to the head, having one more _amah_ if the hands were stretched towards the sky.

These were the most common length measurements for measuring small lengths. In some trades, however, other proper measurements were used. For example, stonemasons and architects used _gazith_ stones. In the harvesting of sheaves, the _hhabilah_ was used, which more than length was a measure of the thickness of the bundle. There were also other stones that marked dimensions such as the _pizzla_ or the _morbia_, the latter three _emoth_ long.

For surveying, the measure of the elbow or the like were not very practical, which is why others were used. One frequently mentioned is the _pagham_ or “sole of the foot”, plural _paghamim_. It was also called _regel_ and was estimated to be equivalent to two _tephahhim_. The _sorah_ call itself was four _emoth_ wide. The Latinos called this measure _porca_.

Another measure similar to this one is the _tsaghad_, sometimes called _pezzigha_, which could be considered the “step”. But this measure was the least reliable. Some men take much longer steps than others ([2 Sam 6:13](/en/Bible/2_Samuel/6#v13)).

Among the longest measures of length we have the _berath_, translated as “mile”. It is mentioned a few times in the scriptures ([Gn 35:16](/en/Bible/Genesis/35#v16), [Gn 48:7](/en/Bible/Genesis/48#v7), [2 Re 5:19](/Bible/2_Kings/5#v19)). The rabbis used to say that this mile was roughly equivalent to a thousand _emoth_. Sometimes the mile is also called _cherub_ or _erub_, the maximum distance that could be walked on the Sabbath.

Another intermediate measure would be the _ruzz_ or _rizz_ (plural _rizzim_ or _ruzzim_) or seventy _kanim_, that is, about 450 cubits, or according to some other mentions, 266 steps. It is often estimated that a mile or _berath_ contains seven and a half _rizzim_, but this mile is surely the “big mile” of almost four miles that is usually called _parazza_ or else the calculations would not add up.

### Capacity Units

The oldest unit is the _sato_ or _zzeah_ or _seah_ (plural _zzeim_ or _seim_), which was already in use at the time of Abraham ([Gn 18:6](/en/Bible/Genesis/18#v6)). The chicken egg was always a widely used unit, called _ghachal_. The _kab_ (plural _kabim_) was a measure for liquids equivalent to 24 eggs, about 1.2 liters today. The fourth part of the _kab_ was the _robeagh_ (which translated as _quartum_ in Latin), also called _log_ if it was to talk about liquids (or _sextarium_ in Latin). The _sato_ was 6 _kabim_, that is, about 7.2 litres. The _sato_ is also related to the dimensions of length when it was ensured that 50 square cubits of land produced one sato of seed. The _sato_ is also implied in that _modio_ or _seah_ that the prophet Elisha spoke of. A _seah_ was apparently a very exact measurement made with a type of pitcher that had a mark in its center to measure half (2 Kgs 7:1,16). This half of the _sato_ or three _kabim_ was a popular measure even in the time of Jesus as the Gospel of Matthew attests (Mt 13:33). It was a very reasonable amount of flour to make a family's bread for one day.

An _epha_ or _ephi_ or _efá_ (plural _ephim_) contains three _zzeim_ or _satos_, and therefore 18 _kabim_. Ruth the Moabite is what he got after gleaning and shelling the field and is sometimes translated as three _modios_ (_satos_) (Ruth 2:17). The _ephah_ is the most popular measure of capacity since ancient times for large quantities and in buying and selling (1 Sam 17:17 and Is 5:10). It was used in other places. The Chaldeans called it _chaila_.

Since the _ephah_ was a very popular measure and had an official pitcher to measure it, many measures arose from it. The _gomer_ is the tenth part of the _ephah_ ([Ex 16:32-36](/en/Bible/Exodus/16#v32)). This measure was very popular as a measure of the daily amount needed for a person's sustenance, and was used for manna in the desert and later for other products with the denomination of bundle or _manipulus_ (Lv 23:10-11). For the Chaldeans this measure was referred to as _halah_ or _haltha_.

As larger capacity measures we have the _chor_ or _coro_, of 30 satos, that is, 180 _kabim_ or ten _efás_. These were the measures that kings usually use to speak of large-scale production (1 Kings 4:22; 5:11).

Sometimes the translation complicates the identification of the measures because there was one called _homer_ (similar to _gomer_) but this _homer_ was equivalent to a _choir_ and its tenth part used to be called _bato_. Therefore, as Ezekiel affirms, the _ephah_ and the _bato_ would be the same, or at least they should be, as the prophet admonished (Ez 45:11). The _homer_ and _bato_ were used for liquids and the _coro_ and _efá_ for aggregates, but their volumes were practically identical. The _homer_ is also often referred to as the 'burden of an ass'. Sometimes this _homer_ or _coro_ was too much for a donkey so there was also another measure, called _lethech_ or _letekh_, half of the _coro_, which was also given the name “burden of a donkey”.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/IMG_0002.png"></figure>
<em> Capacity Units </em>

There were other less well-known measurements, based on the capacity of baskets and similar vessels, such as the _zzal_ or _canistrum_, the basket probably from Mt 14:20, called in Syriac _chupha_; the _mispal_, equivalent to _lethech_; or the _kalzzatra_, a leather pot with capacity for four _kabim_.

A unit widely used in wine and oil was the _hin_, which was twelve _quarters_ or _logim_, that is to say three _kabim_ or the equivalent of that measure when talking about measuring grain and also very frequently it was the _half sato_. It is not uncommon to find this measure in the Bible ([Ex 29:40](/en/Bible/Exodus/29#v40); [30:24](/en/Bible/Exodus/30#v24), Lv 23: 13, Num 15:4-10; 28:5-7, Ez 4:11).

Other more infrequent and difficult measures to measure were the _cado_, which was translated as pitcher, and which was equivalent to the amount of liquid that a woman was capable of transporting ([Gn 24:15](/en/Bible/Genesis/24#v15), Judg 7:16, 1 Kings 18:34). There was also another small measure called in Hebrew _mesurah_ (usually translated as “measure”) which is what Ezekiel was commanded to drink from one day to the next (Ez 4:11), and the _tharvvad_, a large spoonful, like the _zzizz_, another type of ladle, and the _kortob_, a very small measure three-fifths of an egg. Based on vessels and not on spoons, we have evidence of a _kephiza_ (a kind of hundredth of cor), a _kantar_ or _kankan_ (or pitcher), the _anbag_, the _teni_, the _selahhath_, the _thvman_ or _thamnetha_ (Aramaic word), the _tharkab_ (of two kabim), the _sargas_,

### Weight Units

The fundamental unit for the Hebrew weight was the “sacred shekel of the Sanctuary”, that is, the weight of the silver _shekel_ with which payments were made in the temple, and which had the weight of half a Roman ounce, that is, about 13.7g [^1] The scriptures are riddled with references to pesos using this shekel as the unit (such as Judg 8:25 and 1 Chr 8:15).

The rest of the weights considered by the Hebrews are based on this “shekel”, as is the case of the half shekel or the _gerah_ ($\frac{1}{20}$ of the shekel), whose weights were used to quantify amounts of other metals or products.

To designate a very large weight, the Hebrews used the _chichar_ or _kikkar_ (pl. _kikkarim_), which is normally translated as _talent_. It was a flat and wide weight (from which the name comes because _kikkar_ means “plain”), and it was the typical Hebrew word to designate a cake of bread or dried figs. The value of this talent seems to have been 3,000 shekels in the past, that is, about 40 kg, but it is difficult to be precise because in the past the shekel was not a very specific weight, and when the weight was specified, the talent did not have a very specific use. widespread. Talent, however, is a much repeated measure in the Old Testament when referring to sendings that kings made to others (for example, 2 Kgs 18:14).

## Roman units

The Romans weighed, counted, and measured in pounds, asses, and feet respectively, all divided into twelve units (for example, one as = twelve unciae). Undoubtedly, the Romans opted for the decimal system (still in force and used since the beginning of Ancient Egypt, 5,000 years ago) to be able to count on the fingers of both hands (a one is a finger, five the open hand and the ten the two crossed hands, IVX). The use of the duodecimal system was used in Mesopotamia, possibly due to the fact of having the phalanges of the fingers, because it is a number divisible by 2, 3, 4 and 6 and, perhaps, because it is associated with the twelve lunar cycles.

In the forum of the Roman cities, the “mensa ponderaria” was religiously guarded, with the patterns to contrast the measures and weights that were used in commercial transactions.

### Area and length units

Surface measurement was the geodesic act (equivalent to half a day's work) and the _jugerum_ (from _jugum_ = yoke or yoke, which was equivalent to a full day's work). An _actus_ was equivalent to 120 square feet. Although theoretically surface measurements, they were more like working measurements.

The Roman system of length measurements had the following units, in order of size:

* _digitus_, the finger, which equals 18.481 mm or $\frac{1}{16}$ pies.
* _palmus_, is not actually related to the span (which would be the measurement between the ends of the thumb and little finger with the hand outstretched), but rather to the Castilian coto, which is the width of the palm of the closed hand without the thumb, and was equal to 4 fingers, 7.3925 cm or $\frac{1}{4}$ feet.
* _pes_, or foot, which includes 16 _digitus_ or 4 _palmus_, that is, 29.57 cm. The archetype of the Roman foot is deposited in the temple of Juno Moneta.
* _palmipes_, or span-foot, which was equivalent to 20 fingers or 5 palmus, that is, 36.9625 cm or $\frac{5}{4}$ feet.
* _cubitus_ or _ulna_, similar to the elbow, which was equivalent to 6 _palmus_, 44,355 cm or $\frac{3}{2}$ feet.
* _gradus_, which was equal to 40 digitus, 10 _palmus_, that is, 73.925 cm or $\frac{5}{2}$ feet. It is a measure similar to the “step” of later times.
* _passus_, would actually be a double step and it was the distance between two supports of the same foot while walking. It was equal to 2 _gradus_, 20 _palmus_, 5 feet or 1.4785 m.
* decempeda o pertica_, equivalent to 10 pies, 2,957 m, 2 miles, 4 degrees u 8 palmipes.
* directed against, o I start from 24 paces, 35,489 mo 120 pies.
* _stadium_, or stadium, which includes 125 _passus_, that is, 184.81 m.
* _millia passus_, which gave rise to the mile. Its name comes from the fact that there are 1,000 passus, that is, 1,478.5 m or 5,000 feet.
* _leuca_ or legua, which was equivalent to 1,500 passus, 7,500 feet, or 2,222 m.

For length measurements, the _pertica_ or the _actus vorsus_ was used. The square _actus vorsus_, multiplied by two, gave the _iugerum_.

The _congius_, the _sextarius_, and the _cyathus_ were measures of liquids, and the last two were also used for solids.
### Weight Units

Initially the measure was the pound divided into twelve parts, called ounce, and the ounce in turn, was divided into 24 scruples.

The weights were also brought into line with the Greeks and four Roman pounds became worth three Attic mines.

The ounce (symbol: oz) is a unit of mass used since ancient Rome to more accurately weigh merchandise and other items, especially if their weight was less than a Roman pound. The ounce is still commonly used in Anglo-Saxon countries, and in the past its use was more widespread throughout Europe. It had an approximate equivalent to 27.4 g.

The word ounce comes from the Latin _ūncia_, derived in turn from the Proto-Indo-European _*oinoko-_ (from which _unique_ also derives), a suffixed form of the root _*oino-_ (from which _one_ also derives). The _ūncia_ was the fractional unit used by the Romans, who used duodecimal fractions; that is, it meant “a twelfth part.” In the monetary context, the _uncia_ was the coin of value corresponding to $\frac{1}{12}$ of as. For its part, the ounce of weight was $\frac{1}{12}$ of a pound (note that the 16-ounce pound is later than the 12-ounce pound). The English words _ounce_ (ounce) and _inch_ (inch = $\frac{1}{12}$ of a foot) are also derived from _ūncia_.

**GEOGRAPHY**

# Ancient Geography Writings

Following Jean-Noël Robert, the ancient writings on geography that have come down to us can be classified into three types:

* descriptions of itineraries, an example of which would be the “Eritrean Sea Tour”;
* works of physical and human geography, such as those of Herodotus, Polybius, Strabo and Pliny the Elder;
* and mathematical treatises, such as those written by Eratosthenes, director of the library of Alexandria at the end of the 3rd century BC

How did Jesus' contemporaries view the Earth? What physical vision of the world did peoples such as the Jews and the rest of the territories under the double Roman and Eastern influence have?

Basically, the theories that had gained the most success at that time were those of Eratosthenes.

For Eratosthenes, who had calculated the circumference of the Earth, the globe was divided into five parts: two glacial zones located at each of the poles, a torrid zone between the tropics and two temperate zones between the torrid zone and each of the glacial areas. On this globe, the inhabited land formed a single large continent situated in the northern hemisphere, mainly in the temperate zone, and totally surrounded by the sea.

These theories were also extended by those of Crates de Mallos (around the middle of the 2nd century BC), who was director of the library of Pergamon, a rival of that of Alexandria.

The great difference between the Earth seen by Eratosthenes and the one imagined by Crates lay in the fact that the latter assumed -gratuitously- the existence of other worlds (probably three) located around the one described by his rival. Of these inaccessible worlds, one was located in the center of the world of Eratosthenes, that is, south of the equator, and the other two on the other side of the globe, arranged like the first two at either end of the equator. The emerged lands would thus give the impression of being separated by arms of the sea in the shape of a cross and completely surrounded by water. Crates also hypothesized that some part of these other worlds could be inhabited, for example the areas that touch the tropics where the “Ethiopians” lived. (The word,

As an indication of the popularity of these theories on the arrangement of the continents, a eulogy of Messala has come down to us, from an unknown young poet (probably Tibullus, who belonged to the circle of the consul of the year 31 BC):

The Earth is suspended in the air that surrounds it on all sides and forms a globe whose whole is divided into five zones. Two of them are perpetually ravaged by glacial cold, enveloped in darkness; the beginning waters never reach their course, but harden into thick sheets of ice and snow since the Sun never sends its rays towards them. The one in the center is subjected to the heat of Phoebus, both in summer when it approaches the Earth while it crosses the sky and in winter, when it accelerates its pace to end the days; In addition, the ground does not rise with the passage of the plow, there are no sown fields that produce crops or pastures on the land; the gods, Bacchus and Ceres, do not visit these fields and no living being inhabits these completely burned regions. Two fertile zones extend between these and the glacial zones, ours and the one that corresponds in the other hemisphere, both similar and temperate thanks to the two climates that surround them at both ends, mutually neutralizing their influence; peacefully, the year offers us its seasons; the bull has learned to submit his neck to the yoke; the vineyard, flexible, to raise its branches; the fields provide their ripe crops every year, the earth is full of iron and the sea of ​​bronze; the cities rise surrounded by walls. the bull has learned to submit his neck to the yoke; the vineyard, flexible, to raise its branches; the fields provide their ripe crops every year, the earth is full of iron and the sea of ​​bronze; the cities rise surrounded by walls. the bull has learned to submit his neck to the yoke; the vineyard, flexible, to raise its branches; the fields provide their ripe crops every year, the earth is full of iron and the sea of ​​bronze; the cities rise surrounded by walls.

In this poem the five zones of the Eratosthenes system are portrayed. Virgil makes an identical description of him in the Georgics (Georgics, 231-258), a vision of the world that would not be slightly modified until the second century of our era.

The Roman vision of the known world focused primarily and with some precision on the Greek world. Eratosthenes attributed a small area to the Asian continent, so that there was not a great distance by sea between the eastern coast of India and the Strait of Gibraltar. Seneca (Natural Questions, I 13) judged that a few days were necessary to reach India from Gades (Cádiz). This led to the voyage of Christopher Columbus much later.

Cartography is a means of describing the Earth that is even older than geography; first there were the plans of the Babylonians and Egyptians, but then the Greeks elaborated the first world maps, around 575 BC, following the model of flat and elongated projection that has prevailed until our days.

The best known map is called “Peutinger”, a medieval copy of a Roman original, which shows the routes and main cities that ran through the empire. The maps were among the Romans a common tool as educational material. It was also used as propaganda of a winner in a battle, representing the conquered territories. The famous and talented minister of Augustus, Agrippa, was commissioned to put on the walls of the portico of Vipsania, in the Field of Mars, a map of the world, but only of the Roman world. There is much discussion about this map, which has been lost, and which is known to represent the Caspian Sea, Armenia, Media, Parthia, Persia, Mesopotamia, the Red Sea, Egypt, Ethiopia and India, together with the Roman Empire, but not it is known if Serica appeared. Be that as it may,

# Empires at the time of Jesus

In most of the books that describe the time of Jesus, the Roman empire is usually spoken of, and perhaps a little of the Parthian empire. It is taken for granted that the fact of the domination of Judea by the Romans was only a direct influence of Western trends. But it is forgotten that the known world, if only by legends or mythological stories, was much larger and more varied than that restricted to the Roman empire, and that the cultural influences and communications between the different empires in existence were much richer and more complex. .

Jean-Noël Robert shows it this way:

> Four empires, in fact, divided up the government of the universe and reached together, at the beginning of our era, a period of great political stability that made possible the free circulation of men, goods and ideas: the China of the Han (especially of the second dynasty), the northern India of the Kushans, the empire of the Parthians and that of the Romans. Long and painstaking efforts throughout the centuries were necessary in each one of them so that at the dawn of the first millennium a vast current of exchanges between the Roman extreme West and the Chinese extreme East could culminate. [_From Rome to China_, Jean-Nöel Robert]

That is, at the time of Jesus there were four great empires, which by a strange coincidence, coexisted as great unified and pacified territories during that period. In a few moments of humanity since then, that circumstance has been able to occur again, which allowed travelers of the time to travel from Rome to China and vice versa, within a reasonable scarcity of danger and ignorance. The routes to the east were relatively well known, and shipping across the Mediterranean Sea to Rome was also fairly well mastered, making the time of Jesus, just before and after, a particularly booming time for trade, transportation, and transportation. cultural and human exchanges.

The empire of the Kushans was at the time of Jesus an empire in the making, but it was already the germ of the empire that had some relevance in the second century of our era. It was located within a group of intermediate kingdoms between Parthia and the Far East, called Sogdiana, Bactria, Magdiana, Kapica and Gandhara, small compared to the great extensions of the four main ones. This is how Jean-Noël Robert puts it:

> However, the Kushan, that is to say one of the tribes that we have found described in the Chinese annals under the name of Yu Che and who managed to place themselves at the head of the five tribes that made up that people, did not establish their domination until well into the first century of our era and did not know glory until a century later. Previously, this immense territory that includes Central Asia (Sogdiana, Bactria, Magdiana,...) and North India was under the domination of the Maurya emperors and the heirs of Alexander the Great. [From Rome to China, Jean- Noel Robert]

In short, that the configuration of the world was formed by several great empires:

* the Roman, from Hispania to the west, Syria in the east, Britannia in the north and Mauritania, Numidia, Africa, Cyrene and Egypt in the south;
* Parthian, from the Euphrates to the Indus River, although part of the Indus Basin had already begun to be conquered by the Kushans;
* the Kushan, occupying the entire Indus Basin from the Eritrean Sea to the Aral Sea;
* the Hindus, located in the territory of present-day India, between the Indus and the Ganges and further east;
* The Chinese, who were actually identified at that time as “beings” or “inhabitants of Serica” ​​(place of origin of silk), were not located in a very precise place. There were several legends about this town, which we will give a better account of in another appendix;
* other no less important peoples: the Germans, the Ethiopians (this is how the Romans designated all the peoples with tanned skin) and the Arabs.

The unification achieved in each empire had different paths:

* In China, Huang Ti (died 210 BC), was the first unifier of China, and Liu Pang, founder of the Han dynasty, who reigned with a brief parenthesis until 220 AD, was the one who administratively organized China.
* In India, Chandragupta, who abdicated in 301 BC, emerged after the death of Alexander the Great, was a chief of the Magadha region who unified an Indian empire that would stretch more than two thousand kilometers from the river basin Indus to the Ganges and the Bay of Bengal. He was the founder of the Mauryan dynasty, which remained in power until 184 BC, when it went back to the days of independent rajahs and their rivalries.
* In Parthia, the Parthians emerged from among the Mesopotamian peoples, overthrowing the descendants of Seleucus, Alexander's general. The various Parthian kings, Arsaces (died 248 BC), and Mithridates (died 138 BC) were the ones who further extended and consolidated this empire.
* The Kushan, in fact, were a tribe that seized power in Bactria, one of the intermediate kingdoms between Parthia and China.
* The Romans, after the dangerous period of Caesar's dictatorship, and the civil war between Octavio and Antonio, end up converted into a principality under Octavio, a model of government that Tiberius and his successors will continue. Octavio Augusto was a monarch of much more diplomacy than his predecessors, extending his domain through client-kings and signing agreements with the Parthians, becoming the first great peacemaker of the entire empire.

Due to this confluence of pacifications in all these large areas, it was like the message of Jesus, after he died, it could reach the most remote corners of the Earth. Although we know very well the travels of Paul thanks to the book written by the evangelist Luke, the message of Jesus was not directed only towards the west, as one might conclude from the study of the New Testament. As _The Urantia Book_ states very well, and as the ancient testimonies confirm, there was a much closer and more dynamic contact also with the peoples of the East. This oriental influence in the area where Jesus lived, often ignored, must be duly taken into account in order to form a complete picture of the mentality and the scenario in which the Master lived.

# Greeks in North India?

We know that Alexander the Great arrived at the gates of India, and that he was determined to conquer it, if it were not for the fact that the fatigue of his men and the many months of expedition had significantly reduced his army. He established new towns along the way he followed him, bringing a hint of Hellenic influence throughout the region. But several centuries later, at the time of Jesus, did that influence continue in North India?

In the chapter «Teaching exercises for young people» of _The long-awaited beginning_ the contact between the village of Capernaum with some travelers from distant lands is told. The inspiration for this story comes in part from _The Urantia Book_, where we are told about a caravan stop that Jesus used to frequent, and in part from Jean-Noël Robert's book _From Rome to China_, where the historian investigates the relationships in the time of Jesus between the eastern and western peoples, accounting for the most important archaeological discoveries in this regard.

Among these discoveries, perhaps the most notorious was, in the middle of the last century, the excavation of the ruins of a palace in the current Begram, the ancient city of Kapisi, about 70 km north of Kabul. There, in the ancient capital of the Kushan kingdom, a bewildering treasure trove of luxury items of all kinds appeared: Indian ivory, Chinese lacquerware, Roman bronzes, Greco-Roman silverware, Egyptian and Syrian glassware... Many of them dated to the mid-1st century. from our era or even before, that is, from the time of Jesus.

Among the objects discovered were works of art from the Roman Empire: bronze balance weights depicting Mars and Minerva; bronze feet to support lamps; perfumers and statuettes and romans; Plaster medallions (about 20 cm in diameter) with classical or mythological representations, including the story of Eros and Psyche, some gods of mythology, the grape harvest, etc., in order to serve as models for silver trays of the goldsmiths; Greco-Roman face statues (straight nose, slight smile, Apollonian gaze); warrior heads like those of the Gauls carved in Pergamum; Western-dressed Laocoons spurring Trojan horses; heads of adolescents similar to Antonio...

But the question immediately arose: how did such an artistic explosion appear at the beginning of our era? How is it that similar remains have not been found anywhere in India? We know that there were Greeks in that area at the time of Alexander, and some experts have wanted to see in this art a legacy of Macedonian influence. But such an explanation is not convincing for all historians. Too many years had elapsed since the death of the Greek conqueror for so long an influence to endure. In addition, many of the works were of undoubted Roman influence, and even for some vases similar to those of Pompeii, it has been possible to determine the date of their arrival, never before the middle of the 1st century.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/361px-Gandhara_Buddha_(tnm).jpeg"></figure>
<em> Sculpture of a standing Buddha. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gandhara_Buddha_(tnm).jpeg </em>

The hypothesis that has been considered with more certainty is that there was a close commercial relationship between this kingdom of Kapisi, called Bactria, where the Kushan tribes lived, and the Roman Empire. The result of commercial exchanges was an incessant transfer of products, especially works of art, which traveled from the Far East, along the Silk Road, to the West, and vice versa, from Western ports such as Alexandria, Caesarea, Tyre, Sidon, or Seleucia (the port of Antioch in Syria), towards the East.

It was during the time of Jesus that a prosperous kingdom arose in that region, the Kushan kingdom, which shortly thereafter experienced its moment of greatest splendor under the rule of King Kanishka. From this king, evangelization began in a new type of Buddhism, called «of the great vehicle», which began to represent Buddha as a god and to worry more and more about achieving not only individual salvation through the so-called liberation or nirvana, but also collective liberation. For this reason, in imitation of the western Roman and Greek peoples, who spread their culture through art, architecture and urban planning, the Kushan peoples began a type of art, called from then on “Gandhara art”, with clear Greco-Roman influences.

In this art, Buddha is represented with features reminiscent of Greek sculptures: almond-shaped eyes, an Apollonian face, a serene smile and a hairstyle forming waves up to the shoulders. Only one characteristic was particular to these sculptures: the slightly elongated earlobes.

> From the second century, the similarities with the Roman sculpture of the Antonines become truly surprising. The scenes from the life of the Buddha are not shown in a disorderly and continuous manner as in India, but rather each episode is inserted within a single frame with its own particular decoration, following the typical Roman narrative process. [_From Rome to China_, Jean-Nöel Robert]

It is from all these inquiries that I have obtained the idea of ​​fictionalizing a possible encounter between Jesus and these Kushan people who had come on a journey from their distant kingdom of Bactra. It was during the time of Jesus that this kingdom began to gain importance, so it is acceptable to imagine that they already carried out artistic exchanges with the West, traveling along the northern silk route and avoiding the Parthians, to then go down the path of the sea ​​or via Maris to Alexandria, where they would sell their wares to merchants who would deliver them to Rome. In turn, on the way back, they would not return empty-handed, but would buy Roman, Egyptian and other art objects they passed through, and then sell them in their own country.

Although it is possible that at the time of Jesus the Buddhism known as “great vehicle” was beginning to germinate, I wanted to include it in the story because it offered the opportunity to show the open attitude of Jesus towards other religions, in which he also found elements of interest that he did not hesitate to use in his teachings, even if only in private.

# Geography of Palestine at the time of Jesus

## Country names

Ancient Eastern texts designate Palestine by various names. The classical Egyptian name is retschenu (rtnw) of uncertain significance. In cuneiform texts we find above all the name of Amurru (=the country of the West, seen from Mesopotamia). Hence, the Bible often cites among the pre-Israelites settlers of Palestine, along with the “Canaanites” the “Amorreans.” But only the first of these two names appears in the Bible also as the name of a country (=Canaan).

In the Bible, other names also appear to designate the settlement area of ​​the Israelite tribes, such as “land of Israel” (eres Yisrael), sometimes in the plural form (arsot Yisrael). It is also listed as “land of Yahweh”. The name “Holy Land” (Admat Hakkodes), which is predominant to this day in Christian languages, is mentioned only once in the Bible. The most common name in biblical writings is the “land of Canaan” (you are Knaan), also common, along with Amurru, in cumeiform texts from the eighteenth century BC In the Amarna Letters, Canaan is designated as mat kinahni, kinahna, kinahhi. Since the texts of Nuzi (fifteenth century BC) the word kinahhu has appeared with the meaning of “red purple”, some authors have interpreted mat kinahhi as “land of the red purple”. In fact, on the Phoenician coast there was a flourishing trade in purple cloth. The Greeks also applied to that region a name (Phoinike = Phoenicia) derived from púrupura (phoinix). But this denomination already indicates that the word Canaan did not refer primarily to Palestine, that is, to the southern part of the eastern Mediterranean coast, but to Phenicia, that is, to the northern part of the coastal strip. Actually, both the Akkadian and Egyptian texts apply the name Canaan to refer to Phoenicia. The Bible uses the concept with a wide margin of freedom: to denominate the entire West Bank (that is, Palestine), only for northern and central Palestine, for Transjordan, but also for the coastal strips and more specifically the Phoenician ones, that is, the northern area.

While the name of Canaan appears on many pages of the Scriptures, that of Palestine has an extra-biblical origin. It is derived from the Philistines, a non-Semitic people who inhabited the coastal plain south of Carmel as early as the twelfth century BC (and perhaps even earlier), and whose wars with the Israelites are reported by numerous passages in the Old Testament. It is known that even in Persian times this name was applied to the inhabitants of the coastal strip. It is true that the Greek sailors and merchants gave the name of Syria to the entire space of Former Asia (that is, the area corresponding to our current Palestine, Syria, Lebanon and a part of Iraq), but they distinguished two halves in the coastal part. They differentiated, in effect, the northern half, the “Syria of the Phoenicians”, from the southern or “Syria of the Palestinians” (Syria ton Pala-istinon). Palestinian, therefore, is a Greek remodeling of the word “philistine”. This expression appears for the first time in Herodotus, in the 5th century BC Following Herodotus, also other Greek and Roman writers (including the historian Plutarch) call this southern coastal strip Palestine.

The Roman administration accepted this denomination and from 135 AD applied to the entire province, including the interior areas, the name of Syria Palaestina (it is a substitution of the previous and already derogatory name Iudaea).

For these reasons, we must conclude that at the time of Jesus two common names coexisted to designate the entire Jewish territory: a first internal denomination, drawn from the Scriptures, such as “land of Israel” or only “Israel”; and another international one, by which the rest of the peoples of the world knew him, which was «Palestine». Although today, for political reasons, these designations do not correspond to what has been said, the fact that this was the situation at the time will lead us to designate with these criteria always the area of ​​Jewish settlement at the time.

## Extension and limits of the country

Although Palestine is only a part of the mountainous coastal strip that separates the Mediterranean Sea from the powerful bloc constituted by the Arabian Peninsula, it can be considered to some extent as a geographical unit with natural borders. It has clear western and eastern limits: to the west it limits with the Mediterranean Sea (Great Sea in the time of Jesus), to the east with the Jordan and the closed waters originated by this river.

To trace its northern border there are two natural possibilities; the Leontes or Litani river can be taken as a starting point and the boundary line can be traced eastward to the southern slopes of Hermon (including two of the three sources of the Jordan). Or you can start from the beautiful height of the “Tyre Stairs” (_ros hannikra_) and continue east until you reach the northern shore of ancient Lake Hule.

The southern border also offers two possibilities: either from the southern end of the Dead Sea (Yam Ha-Melah) through Beer-Sheba, _wadi_ Ghazze and Gaza to the Mediterranean Sea. Or also, starting from the same point, by Advat, the Torrent of Egypt (_nahal_ Misrayim) to the sea.

In the strict sense, Palestine barely covered 18,000 km2. One can make a comparative idea if it is known that the province of Cáceres has 19,900 km2.

Some indicative figures will help to provide a more accurate idea of ​​the size of the country. The maximum north-south distance (Metulah-Elat) reaches 430 km. From the Mediterranean to the Jordan, by the latitude of Jerusalem, the distance is about 90 km; from Dan to Beer-Sheba is 240 km; from Jerusalem to Nazareth there are 105 km; from Jerusalem to Jericho 24 km (all these distances are understood in a straight line or as the bird flies).

## Geology of Palestine

As far as we know about the geological history of this region, Palestine has always been a country bordering the sea. The coast of that past sea, of which the Mediterranean is only a residue, was not far from the limits of contemporary Palestine. It seems that for a long time the maritime strip ran through the current Jordan Trench. At some time, that ancient sea receded to the west, so that the land of Palestine came to the surface. There were, instead, other periods during which he advanced to Transjordan. It is clear that the southeastern Palestinian part was always at a higher altitude than the rest of the area, so that it was always above sea level, first around the island, when the mass of water began to recede. Since the area west of the Jordan has always remained under the sea, its rocks are basically the result of marine sediments. These are hard calcareous stones that are permeable to water (mountains of Judah, Carmel, Garizim, Ebal), from which excellent material for construction is obtained (with it the temples of Solomon and Herod were built). There is also a soft limestone, easily eroded by the action of water, which therefore contributed decisively to the formation of the current Palestinian valley system. In Transjordan, where the sea rarely reached, the sandstone rock called Nubian, formed on the continental floor, predominates. It presents a predominant (although not exclusive) reddish color, especially in the southern end of Transjordan, which the Bible calls Edom, that is, “the Red country”. its rocks are basically the result of marine sediments.

It presents a predominant (although not exclusive) reddish color, especially in the southern end of Transjordan, which the Bible calls Edom, that is, “the Red country”.

In the last phase of the Mesozoic, the Cretaceous, the sea again flooded all of Palestine, then the northern part of Transjordan and finally the southern part of this area as well. Later, the waters receded and in an early phase of the Tertiary, in the Eocene, approx. 50 million years ago, Palestine gradually emerged from the sea. Apparently, even then there was a depression (covered by an arm of the sea) along the line where the Jordan Trench would later fracture. The last phase of the Tertiary, the Pliocene, is characterized by two processes that contributed powerfully to the configuration of present-day Palestine. In the first term, during this time a lively volcanic activity was recorded on both sides of the upper part of the Jordan Trench, with sediments of basaltic rock. The other event was the sinking of the Jordan Trench itself. At the end of the Tertiary (about 3 to 2 million years ago), the deep tectonic fracture occurred, whose course can be traced from the Orontes to East Africa and reaches its greatest depth in Palestine. As a result of that geological movement, the Palestinian mountain range that crosses the entire country from north to south was split. The continental area at the western end of the mountain area also sank at the same time, although it later re-emerged from the waters, so that today there is only a narrow strip between the sea and the mountain. Secondary subsidence occurred in the interior of the country, the most important result of which was the Yizreel plain. 3 to 2 million years ago), the deep tectonic fracture took place, whose course can be followed from the Orontes to East Africa and which reaches its maximum depth in Palestine. As a result of that geological movement, the Palestinian mountain range that crosses the entire country from north to south was split. The continental area at the western end of the mountain area also sank at the same time, although it later re-emerged from the waters, so that today there is only a narrow strip between the sea and the mountain.

Secondary subsidence occurred in the interior of the country, the most important result of which was the Yizreel plain.

The Quaternary or Pleistocene began just over 1 million years ago. As is well known, this era is characterized in Europe by four glacial periods separated by three interglacial stages. Palestine did not know great glaciations, but it did experience phases with abundant rains, so that it is in these regions that we should speak of pluvial and interpluvial periods. During the pluvial or diluvial phases, the valleys and interior plains were covered by large lakes. The sea level rose and fell according to the periods of melting or growth of ice masses. In times of high level, the Jordan Trench could perhaps become an inlet of the Mediterranean Sea. In periods of low level, communication with the sea was broken, so that a series of separate lakes appeared; rubber lake, the lake (or sea) of Tiberias and the Dead Sea. This is how Palestine attained, in the course of hundreds of millions of years, its present multiform and pleasant form.

## Physical Geography

This brief glance at the geological history of Palestine allows us to glimpse that four zones can be distinguished in it that run parallel in a north-south direction.

1. The coastal plain

The part of the coastal plain corresponding to Palestine begins in the north near the eminence of the “Stair of Shooting” (ros Hannikar) and is divided into two sections, of different length and width, by the even more prominent summit of the Mount Carmel. The northern section is usually called the Akkó plain, after the city that has dominated it since ancient times. In ancient times it was called the Asher plain, because the Israelite tribe settled in its territory.

Among the different valleys that from the Galilean mountains flow into the plain, the cleft that leads from Safed to Akkó and separates the northern mountainous area from the southern one is particularly striking. Its privileged location, at the north-south crossroads, and the fact that it is the only natural inlet on the Palestinian coast, made Akkó the most important port from the Phoenicians to the Crusades.

The coastal strip of the Gulf of Akkó is now called the Plain of Zebulun. It is made up mostly of sand sediments from the Nile. At the southern edge of the gulf flows the biblical Kishon river or torrent, which rises in the Yizreel plain and, after flowing through the foothills of Carmel, empties into the sea. The mountainous area of ​​Carmel closes the plain of Asher to the south. At its feet lies, since biblical times, the city of Haifa (Shiqmona).

Also in the coastal plain south of the Carmel summit several zones can be distinguished. The first is formed by a narrow strip that runs between Shiqmona and the river of the crocodiles (nahal hattantinim), so named because the alluvial calcareous hills in the area made it difficult for the watercourses to pass freely towards the sea, so that marshy pools were formed in which crocodiles abounded for centuries. Apparently, in ancient times this area was sparsely inhabited, except for the Phoenician city of Dor, which lived facing the sea. From her this part of the coastal strip received the name of Plain of Dor.

A similar situation presents the following area. In the Bible he is called Sharon (hassaron). It extends from the Crocodile River to an imaginary line drawn from Yaffá to the Ayyalón Valley. It is about 80 km long. The most important watercourse in the Plain of Sharon is the Yakon River, which has its source in the biblical city of Afeq and empties into the sea near the northern suburbs of Tel Aviv. In the northern part of the plain of Sharon should be mentioned, among the tributaries, the Alexander River and the Hadera River, which descend from the mountains of Samaria. This beautiful plain, populated today by leafy lemon groves, was covered in biblical times by holm oak forests and was sparsely inhabited. The Bible speaks of the splendor (hadar) of Sharon and in the Song of Songs the companions of the beloved compare her to the daffodils of the wild Sharon. The only major city on this plain in Israelite times was Jaffa or Joppa, until King Herod the Great founded the city of Caesarea, which also reduced the importance of ancient Dor.

The southernmost part of the Palestinian seacoast is formed by the region of the Philistines. It is the last inhabited area of ​​the region before reaching the desert, whose influence is already being felt: the rains are scarcer, the land is drier, and there is no need to fight with the swampy areas. Excellent crops of wheat and barley are gathered there, and wine and oil abound. In the five Philistine cities (Gaza, Ashkelon, Ashdod, Gath or Ekron, and Acaron) trade and culture flourished. The first three have prolonged their existence without interruption to the present day. In any case, the ports of Ashkelon and Ashdod were covered by sand. a strip of dunes that in some points reaches 5 km in width festoons the Philistine coast. The maritime plain has its maximum width in the south.

2. The Palestinian Mountain

a) The mountainous area of ​​Galilee and the plain of Yizreel

The Galilean mountainous area is an extension of the mountains of Lebanon. But, while these reach 3,083 m at their highest peak, in the Galilee area they do not exceed 1,200 m. The area begins in the north with the mountains of Galilee, which is further divided into upper or northern Galilee and lower or southern Galilee. The mountains of Upper Galilee were in biblical times (like Lebanon) very lush, sparsely populated, and played a modest role in Israel's early history. Here is the highest peak in western Jordan (har Merom) of 1208 m. Barely 10 km away as the crow flies, the city of Safed rises to the southeast.

South of the decline which is approx. At the height of Akkó begins the mountainous area of ​​southern Galilee, whose pleasant peaks, partly of volcanic origin, barely reach 500 m. Very close to its abrupt drop towards the plain of Yizreel lies, lying in a hollow, the city of Nazareth, at an altitude of 343-488 m. From the highest point of the town (nebi Sa'in) the gaze reaches, in a northerly direction, the mountains of northern Galilee and the narrow interior plain (bikat bet netofah) about 15 km long and 3 wide, which separates the northern Galilee mountains of the southerners, while to the south, it discovers, above the plain of Yizreel, the Samaritan mountains. To the east of Nazareth rises, from the plain of Yizreel, the round top of Mount Tabor (588 m), whose slopes are covered with thickets and chaparral. It is an excellent point of orientation, visible from a great distance. To the south, the Yizreel plain borders the Samaritan mountains and is framed, to the northwest, by the foothills of these mountains, which are an extension of Carmel, and by Mount Gilboa to the northeast. Between the Tabor and the Gilboa, the so-called “Little Hermon” (Givat Hammoreh) of 515 m, divides the eastern basin of Yizreel into two halves, whose waters flow into the Jordan, the northern one from wadi es-sarrar (nahal Tabor), the southern from nahal Harod. The Quisón flows on its way to the Mediterranean along the Carmel chain. Both this river and its numerous tributaries provided the alluvial plain of Yizreel, since biblical times, with extraordinary fertility,

The Yizreel plain has five access points: two to the west, one to the north, one to the east, and finally one to the south. To the east, the passes of Nahal Jokneam and Nahal Iron, together with the fortresses of Yoknean and Meggidó, offer gentle paths up to the interior plain. From the north it is reached by the road that leads from Akkó to Yokneam and then back to Meggidó; from the east through the valley of the aforementioned nahal Harod dominated by the fortress of Bet Sán. The most important accesses are protected by the fortresses of Meggidó and Bet-Sán, which have a rugged historical past several thousand years old. The armies that, coming from the south, advanced along the sea coast, abandoned it in the region of present-day Hadera, They entered the plain of Yizreel through Meggido and left it again at Beth-San, to take the direction of Damascus. Hence, Meggidó has become a prototype of the battlefield and even a symbol of eschatological combat (Harmage-don). The most famous battles of the biblical period were the victory of Thutmose III over the coalition of Syrian princes, with the consequent conquest of Meggido, in 1468 BC, and the defeat inflicted on the Judaite king Josiah, in 609 BC, against Pharaoh Necó II, who was advancing against the fortress of Meggidó.

b) The mountain of Samaria

To the south, the Yizreel Plain empties into the small Dothan Plain, which extends into a depression that runs first in a south-westerly, then south-eastern, and finally southerly direction. This depression divides the Samaritan Highlands into two halves, one northern and one southern, and within each half into a western mountainous region, which slopes gently down to the coastal plain, and an eastern one, which plunges abruptly into the trench. of the Jordan. This is the line that the road has followed since ancient times. The pass offers a truly impressive view of the gorge that separates the northern Mount Ebal (928m) from the southern Mount Gerizim (868m). From this step the path is easily mastered. It is therefore not surprising that we find in this area, in biblical times, the Canaanite fortress of Shechem and present-day Nablus. This point is all the more important for the fact that it not only extends the trade route to the south, but also the pass opens up to the east through the small plain of sahl askar, from which a valley of abundant waters, the wadi Fara, facilitates communication, first to the northeast and then to the southeast, with the Jordan Valley and with the most important of the fords of this river.

c) The mountain of Judah

While the Galilean mountain is clearly separated by the plain of Yizreel from the Samaritan mountain, the transition from the latter to the mountainous area of ​​Judah is almost imperceptible. In any case, there is a cut, made up of the Lubban plain and the Wadi Selun, which descends from the biblical city of Silo and intersects in Lubban (Leboná) with the trade route. A modern highway winds its way up Judah Mountain, whose peaks range between 700 and 1,000m. It is also extended by the mountain gorge that the road uses and divides the area into an eastern and a western half. In some places the valley is so narrow and remote that, until recently, it was somewhat hazardous. Not without good reason, the cut, which runs near the 32nd parallel, It has preserved to this day the significant name of wadi el-haramiyye (“Valley of Thieves”). Not far from here, to the southeast, is the highest peak of the chain, the tell el-Asur, the biblical Baal-Hasor. Further south, in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, the landscape takes on a softer and more pleasant aspect. The most outstanding peaks are: to the west of the road, the nebi Samuel (“Prophet Samuel”) of 895 m, the biblical Gibá or Gibeá de Saúl, of 839 m, the residence of the first king of Israel, located in a dominant position . This cleft in the mountain ends at the Mount of Olives, which places us very close to Jerusalem. in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin, the landscape takes on a softer and more pleasant aspect. The most outstanding peaks are: to the west of the road, the nebi Samuel (“Prophet Samuel”) of 895 m, the biblical Gibá or Gibeá de Saúl, of 839 m, the residence of the first king of Israel, located in a dominant position .

This cleft in the mountain ends at the Mount of Olives, which places us very close to Jerusalem.

Among the towns in the area, it is worth highlighting Bethlehem, 8 km south of Jerusalem. In this southern direction the mountain narrows and consequently the coastal plain widens. The mountainous zone of Judá reaches its maximum altitude (1028 m) next to Hebron. This mountainous part is well watered, enjoys a healthy and cool climate and is famous, from biblical times to the present day, for the great wealth of its vineyards. To the west, the mountain of Judah descends in steps towards the sea plain (the most famous of which is “the ascent of Beth-Horon”), along which runs the traditional route from Joppa to Jerusalem. The bare calcareous peaks of the Judah mountain are the result of a savage felling of mountains in the Arab-Turkish era. In biblical times they must have been covered with trees,

The transition zone between the mountain and the coastal plain, called in the Old Testament Sefela (sefelah = depression, hollow, lowland, from the point of view of the mountain dwellers), is a region of hills dotted with valleys, from 300 to 400 m altitude; The Israelites and the Philistines fought hard and endless battles here to gain control of this border region between their respective settlements. The Shefela is, together with the mountain (har) and the southern area (negeb), one of the classic landscapes of the Bible. In biblical times it was apparently plentiful with sycamore and olive trees.

To the east, the mountain of Judah plunges in formidable undulations into the Jordan Trench, at the bottom of which, and along the western shore of the Dead Sea, forms a wall of almost vertical walls. As this part of the mountain is sheltered from the rain, its appearance is steppe; It is the famous “Desert of Judah”, a favorite place of refuge, in biblical times, for political fugitives or those who sought God. There David fled from the persecution of Saul, there, it is believed, Jaun the Baptist and Jesus prepared themselves for their public activity. The region was inhabited, both in the biblical period and in later times, by numerous monastic communities. The most outstanding that we know today was the Qumran community. The most important route of communication between the mountain of Judah and the Jordan ditch from Jerusalem to Jericho through the desert runs through wadi el-kelt, and along it the people circulated until the end of Turkish rule. Another route leads from Jericho and the northwestern shore of the Dead Sea to Bethlehem through the small inland plain of el-bukea (drained by wadi kumran). On the eastern edge of the desert, where a spring emerges, an oasis of tropical vegetation emerges in its surroundings. The oases of Jericho and En-Gadi are famous in the Bible.

d) The Negev

South of Hebron the farmlands give way to the great southern desert. The Biblical name for him is Negeb. Beer-Sheba, which in biblical times was a flourishing trade center for caravans from the desert and agricultural regions, is mentioned in the Old Testament as the southernmost of the Israelite cities.

The southern desert is lost in the Sinai Peninsula. The part attributed to Palestine has the approximate shape of a triangle, resting on one of its vertices, with a base of about 110 km and a height of 190 km. Thus, from the beginning of the Negeb to its southern limit there is as much distance as to the northern limit of Palestine. While Beer-Sheba does not exceed 240 m above sea level, the Negeb ascends, towards the south, until reaching altitudes of 1035 m (that is, similar to those of the Judah mountain next to Hebron). The Negeb is articulated in summits that run, in a more or less parallel direction, from the northeast to the southwest and descend more abruptly and steeply in the southeast than in the northwest. Erosion has formed impressive craters at three points, called in Israel maktesim (“mortars”): the “Great Maktes”, the “Little Maktes” and the “High Maktes”. The latter is by far the largest of them all. The highest peaks of these maktesim reach, respectively, 710, 540 and 1006 meters.

3. The Jordan Trench

This is the name given to the Palestinian part of the great tectonic subsidence of the Tertiary that extends the high valley that separates the mountain ranges of Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon. The part of the trench that falls towards Palestine reaches from Hermon to the Gulf of el-Akaba and is divided into two halves by the Dead Sea. The northern half is characterized by the course of the Jordan and Lake Gennesaret, formed by that river (Jordan Trench in the strict sense of the term), while the southern half is a desert trench.

The Jordan rises from three magnificent sources at the foot of Hermon, whose snowy summit can be seen from a great distance in Galilee. The meaning of the Hebrew word yarden is discussed. In the Bible this name is always preceded by an article (hayarden). Due to its abrupt unevenness, the Hebrew verb yarad (=to flow torrentially) has been thought of. But the opinion that the name has Indo-Germanic origin is more shared. Homer mentions a Yardanos from Crete. “Jordan” would, according to this, be a generic name, a generic name that simply means “river.”

The northernmost of the three streams that form the Jordan, the Nahr el-Hasbani, rises on the western slopes of the Hermon. On the southern slope of this mount is joined by the nahal Dan, which rises in the old city of Dan. Both join, at 43 m above sea level, with the nahal Paneas, coming from Syria. The easternmost of these fountains is the most historically famous. The Jordan rises here, with mighty impetus, from the depths of a formidable grotto of calcareous rock. This prodigy of nature has awakened in men, since ancient times, feelings of veneration for divine powers.

Here the Phoenicians venerated their god Baal. The Greeks consecrated the place to the god of nature Pan and called it Paneion, and Paneas to the nearest city. When Augustus gave the entire region as a gift to Herod the Great, the monarch had a white marble temple built on top of the rocky reef to honor his benefactor. His son Herod Philippi made of ancient Paneas a new city, which he named, in honor of Caesar and himself, Caesarea Philippi. The synoptic gospels place here a stay of Jesus with the apostles.

Once the three sources meet, the river runs through a fertile plain of tropical vegetation, located almost at sea level. Until recently, the Jordan formed here, in an area plagued by malaria, the small Lake Hule. From this point, and up to its mouth in the something Genesaret, it crosses the Jordan, in a distance of 16 km, a drop of 210 m (from +2 to -208 m in relation to the level of the Mediterranean). From the point where the ancient road to Damascus crosses the Jordan (“Jacob's Daughters Bridge”), the river plunges into a deep and save gorge with numerous rapids through black basalt rocks in a southerly direction, before emptying into gently into the Lake of Gennesaret tempered by a sandbank formed by the Jordan current itself.

Lake Gennesaret is framed in a quadrangular valley, bounded on its western side by the mountains of Galilee and on the eastern side by the heights of the Transjordanian counterplain. The southern shores are, on both sides, steeper than the northern ones. The only noteworthy opening of the lake basin (outside the northern and southern ends of the Jordan Valley) is formed by the small plain of Genesar, on the northwestern edge of the lake, from where several connecting valleys lead to the mountains of the Jordan Valley. Upper Galilee (Safed), to the inner Galilee plain and to Nazareth. The lake has a maximum north-south length of 21 km, a maximum east-west width of 12 km, and a maximum depth of 44 m. Its surface is 168 km2, and its level is 208 m below the Mediterranean. The water is sweet, transparent and, to the water that in biblical times, offered abundant fishing. The peculiar situation of the lake explains its well-known sudden storms. During the day, enormous heat is concentrated in the hollow (temperatures of up to 50º in summer are not uncommon). At dusk the cold winds from the sea penetrate through the mountains of Galilee. Hovering over the warm caldera, and since cold air is heavier than hot air, they rush over the lake basin at great speed and furiously pummel the surface of the water.

The Jordan leaves the lake of Genesaret at its southwestern end and advances southward, winding in innumerable meanders, towards the Dead Sea. Along the 110 km that separate this sea from the lake as the crow flies, the river descends from -208 to -390 meters. in the first 40 km the valley is wide and fertile, the rain and the tributaries still provide abundant water. The most important of these tributaries are, on the eastern shore, the Yarmuk, which empties near the lake, and on the western shore, the Nahal Harod, coming from the Yizreel plain. Along this route, the Jordan also offers easy access, since its bed is more or less at the same height as the bottom of the valley.

In contrast to the previous journey, the last 70 km of the lower Jordan Valley offer an entirely different picture. The valley becomes increasingly narrow and deep. From the west the slopes of the Samaritan mountains approach, and from the east the mountainous region of Gilead rushes. The area becomes steppe, the soil no longer supports crops and the vegetation is sparse. After approx. 20 km, the trench widens again and receives important tributaries on both banks, both physical and historical: to the east the Yabbok, to the west the wadi Fara, which empties into the Jordan through the historic Adam's ford. On its final path, the pit is almost as long as it is wide, so that it forms a kind of circle. This is, in fact, the expression (kikkar = circle) that the Bible uses. Here the Jordan no longer flows, as in the north, at the level of the valley floor. This presents, on both sides of the river, a wide terrace, called in Arabic el-ghor (“sinking, depth”). From here the loamy ground falls in fantastic shapes towards the river bed. This fall receives in Arabic the name of kattara (“ravine”). After a few hundred meters we find ourselves on the vertical bank of the Jordan, which, during its course, acquires increasingly yellowish tones, due to the clay soil. Only the strip immediately to the river maintains tropical vegetation, in which salty species are particularly represented, such as the tamarisks of the Jordan, and where, in the time of Jeremiah, lions abounded. In our days some wild boars still survive. Hence the OT calls this area “the splendor, the pomp, the gala of the Jordan.”

Not far from the Jordan, on the elevated marly terrace of the ghor (although always below the level of the Mediterranean, Beth-Sán: -130 m; Jericho: -250 m) are found, according to the latest archaeological discoveries, the oldest known urban settlements not only in Palestine but in the entire world. These settlements were facilitated by the sources that give rise to oases of tropical vegetation. The largest and most important of these oases is that of Jericho. Its leafy and abundant palm trees, its fruit trees, offer a vivid contrast with the arid and bare desert that surrounds it.

The influence of the Dead Sea is felt a few kilometers upstream of the river. This sea constitutes, without a doubt, the most curious body of water on our planet. It is 78 km long, has a maximum width of 17-18 km and reaches depths of up to 400 m. its total area oscillates around 1000 km2. The average level of the water surface is -395 m (but this was not known until 150 years ago). An anvil-shaped peninsula, extending from the eastern shore to more than half the basin, divides the sea into two halves. Of these, only the northern part reaches the aforementioned depths, while the southern part is only a few meters deep. The name of the Dead Sea is not biblical. This is due to the fact that, as a result of the high salt content of this inland sea, there is in it no trace of plant or animal life of higher organisms. In the Bible it receives the names of “Sea of ​​the Desert” (because of the desert trench of the Arabah that borders it in the south), “East Sea” (as opposed to the Mediterranean Sea, Great Sea or Western Sea) and “ Sea Salt” or “Sea of ​​Salt”.

The salt content of the Dead Sea reaches about 25%, that is, 8 times higher than the average of the oceans. The phenomenon is due to the fact that it is a sea without drainage. Consequently, the salt content of this inland sea, which in prehistoric times was probably an arm of the Mediterranean, has been increasing over time, all the more so as the Jordan River crosses saline terrain. This proportion maintains constant levels because it loses through evaporation a volume of water similar to that which it receives (about 6.5 million tons per day).

Given the extremely harsh living conditions in the Dead Sea, there has never been a dense human population in its surroundings. However, the Bible mentions the existence, in remote times, of five cities in the area, all of which (except one) would have disappeared in a catastrophe: Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Seboyim and Bela or Shoar. The excavations carried out have revealed a high cultural level as early as the fourth millennium BC There is no doubt that the oases of En-Gedí and Eneglayim, on the western edge of the Dead Sea, were inhabited in biblical times (the excavations of En-Ged´ -i have brought to light the existence of a powerful cult center in the fourth millennium BC and five stages of settlement from the time of Josiah (7th century BC) to the Byzantine period). Today we also know that in Qumran, on the NW shore of the Dead Sea, he lived, between the 2nd century BC and the 1st AD, a Jewish religious community. In the oasis of En-Gedí, famous in biblical times for its vineyards, palm trees, early vegetables and other crops grow again today.

The Dead Sea extends into a steppe trench (the Bible uses the denomination ha arabah to designate the Jordan Trench, north of the Dead Sea). It runs between the Palestinian Negeb and the plateau of Edom and in its maximum dimension, from the southern tip of the Dead Sea to the apex of the Gulf of Aqaba (Elat), it reaches almost 180 km. Three unequal areas can be distinguished in it: the first 15 km south of the Dead Sea form the salt marshes of Sodom. It is covered by a dense undergrowth of salt plants and is, for the most part, absolutely impassable. In this stretch, the trench rises from 390 m to about 250 below the Mediterranean snow. In the Middle Araba, the terrain continues to rise until reaching 230 m above the level of the Mediterranean, although this rise is almost imperceptible, since it occurs over 90 km. This area ends at the seluhat nosah ridge. From here, the southern Arabá begins a gentle descent that arrives, in the Gulf of Aqaba (Elat), at sea level. For the most part, the valley floor is covered by hard pebbles, although saline calderas with softer soil, groundwater, and salty tropical flora appear from time to time.

4. Transjordan

It is a plateau of about 800 m of average altitude. On its western side it descends sharply towards the Jordan Trench, while on the east it flows into the Syro-Arabic desert. Rainfall decreases as you move from north to south and from west to east. Four mighty transverse valleys articulate the entire region into five zones. The northernmost of them, facing the Hule Basin and Lake Gennesaret, is today called the Golan (the Roman Gaulanitis), and is the westernmost part of the biblical country of Bashan, famous for its oak forests and its magnificent herds. This 1,000-m-high volcanic landscape, with extinct craters rising to 1,200 m, softens to the east to become a 600-m cereal plain, bearing the significant name of en-nukra (“the hole”). To the east it borders the weakly inhabited lava field of el-ledja (“the refuge” of dubious people), the ancient Trachonitides, to the southeast by the basalt mountains of the biblical Juran, from which the Latin name Auranitis was derived, which designates the entire region. its highest summit rises to 1839 m.

The Yarmuk marks the dividing line between the Golan and the forested adjlun. Its highest peak reaches 1261 m. The adjlun corresponds to the Biblical region of Gilead, of smiling landscapes, celebrated since ancient times for its extensive forests, in which medicinal plants abounded. The impressive ruins next to the town of Djerasen continue to testify even today that the city of Gerasa, which was part of the Decáolis, was the capital of the entire region from the Hellenistic to the Byzantine era.

The adjlun is bordered to the south by the Yabbok. This river, which has its source near the ancient Ammonite capital of Rabbat Ammon (ancient Philadelphia), heads north and northwest in its upper course, takes a westerly direction south of Gerasa, and then heads to through a deeply sunken bed, to the Jordan, which he reaches at the ford of ed-damge. During this journey, it overcomes a difference in altitude of almost 1,100 m (from +758 to -350). The land south of the Yabbok is called belká (“Land without trees”), with wide plateaus (and a maximum height of 1,096 m). In the belká inhabited in the past the Ammonites. From Mount Nebo, in a foothill of the western mountain range, Moses contemplated, according to biblical tradition, the land of Canaan and there he died.

The Arnon Gorge marks the dividing line between Belkah and the ancient habitat of the Moabites. The river receives numerous tributaries from the plateau of the Sio-Arabian steppe and channels the winter rains to the Dead Sea through a bed deeply carved into the mountain, the last section of which is shaped like a canyon. The height difference between the source of the river and the Dead Sea is about 1,300 m. To the south, the region of the Moabites was bounded by the Biblical stream or torrent of Zerad, the present wadi el-hesa, which forms a gorge as deep as that of the Arnon and empties south into the Dead Sea. At present, this entire region between the two rivers is called el-kerak, from the name of its most important locality. The defensive city of Kerak has in the wadi el-kerak, which carries its rounded stones to the Lisán peninsula, an excellent natural fortress. North of wadi el-kerak, the belka extends into the Moabite region, with an average altitude of about 800 m. The climate becomes increasingly steppe. South of wad el-kerak, on the other hand, the plateau rises to 1,641 m. To the east, the mountain dissolves into the Syro-Arabian desert, while to the west it falls vertically towards Arabah. The landscape is increasingly dominated by a reddish stone that reminds us that we are in Edom, “the red country” (from the Hebrew adom = red). The ruins of the city of Petra are of exceptional interest. South of wad el-kerak, on the other hand, the plateau rises to 1,641 m.

## The weather

The climate of Palestine has remained without major changes from biblical times to the present day. It is extremely healthy, subtropical (tropical in the Jordan Trench), with shorter summer days and longer winter days than in temperate zones (the longest days have 14 solar hours, the shortest 10. The very short twilight duration: after sunset, night breaks almost suddenly).

There are numerous allusions in the Bible to the Palestinian climate. Thus, the promise of Genesis: “While the earth lasts, sowing and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night will not cease.”

As can be seen from this quote, there are only two seasons in this region: summer and winter. The winter (horef) is characterized by rain, the summer (kayis) by the absence of precipitation. The season of the early rains (yoreh = autumn rain), and ends in March/April, with the beautiful late rains (malkos = spring rain). According to these seasons, sowing is carried out in winter, because then the earth is spongy thanks to the action of the first rains. The harvest is obviously harvested in summer. It is understandable, then, that the Jews place the beginning of the year, also in our days, in autumn. With the harvest the year ends and the rebirth of life, with the arrival of the first rains, invites a new beginning. The most intense rainfall, accompanied by lacerating winds, They take place in December and January. This last month has the coldest days of the year. During the winter there are, on average, 60 days of rain. But, although the early and late rains are of great importance, they barely contribute a tenth of all precipitation. Its annual average is about 600 mm in Joppa, 560 mm in Jerusalem, 700 in Nablus, 200 in Beer-Sheba and 100 in Jericho. It rarely snows, although there are many cases that exceed all expectations, both in terms of quantity and time. Thus, for example, at the end of January there can be snowfalls of up to 40 cm, and 10 cm on the coast and even in the Jordan Valley. Although the early and late rains are of great importance, they barely contribute a tenth of all precipitation. Its annual average is about 600 mm in Joppa, 560 mm in Jerusalem, 700 in Nablus, 200 in Beer-Sheba and 100 in Jericho. It rarely snows, although there are many cases that exceed all expectations, both in terms of quantity and time.

It rarely snows, although there are many cases that exceed all expectations, both in terms of quantity and time. Thus, for example, at the end of January there can be snowfalls of up to 40 cm, and 10 cm on the coast and even in the Jordan Valley.

The rainy season is followed by a splendid period of flowering and all of Palestine, including the steppe, resembles a polychrome carpet, quickly brought to an end by the summer heat. The cool westerly winds, which blow regularly in the afternoon and evening, make the weather perfectly bearable even in the brighter months (July to September), especially in the Paletina mountains and the Transjordan Plateau. But it is still true that in May and September-October the country is hit by a burning and paralyzing desert wind (serkije or kamsin) that can cause devastating damage to crop areas.

## Political geography

In the time of Jesus, the territory that constituted the Jewish area was a set of changing districts due to the succession of monarchs and wars.

We have to divide the Jewish history of the times of Jesus into two moments that changed the distribution of these districts among their rulers:

1st. The reign of Herod the Great, from 37 to 4 BC

2nd. The government of the sons of Herod the Great or his substitutes, from 4 BC onwards, until 66 AD, the revolt of the people occurred and the war against the Romans took place.

Jesus lived, as we assume, from 7 BC (uncertain date) to AD 30 (certain date). Therefore, his days were passed between the rule of the sons of Herod the Great, if we except those three years of Herod's reign, which in any case, forced Jesus and his parents to move to Egypt.

Therefore, let us determine preferably how the Jewish territory was distributed at the death of Herod. He divided his kingdom among four of his sons at his death. The cast was as follows:

-Tetrarchy of Archelaus: included Judea, Sama-ria and part of Idumea. From the year 6 AD, this territory passed to the government of a procurator due to the serious disturbances that occurred under the government of Archelaus.

-Tetrarchy of Herod Antipas: included Galilee and Perea.

-Tetrarchy of Philip: included Panias, Ulata, Gaulanítide, Batanea, Auranítide and Traconítide.

-Tetrarchy of Lysanias: Abilene corresponded.

There was also a group of cities that worship Salome, Herod's sister. They were these: Azotus (Ashdod), Cedrón, Ekrón, Jamnia (Jabné), Phasaelis, Archelais.

Apart from these territories there were districts not governed by the Herodian family. They were the following:

-Decapolis: autonomous territory not defined by borders of 10 independent cities.

-Phoenicia and the cities of Gaza and Anthedon (Mayumas): formed part of the Roman province of Syria.

-Ammon and Moabitid: two territories south of Pera not subject to Jewish authority.

-Nabatea: kingdom apart from the Jewish, and that had a moment of great splendor especially before the days of Jesus. It was in the desert, surrounding the Jewish territory to the east and south.

-Arabia: the Arabs inhabited the peninsula of their name, and in the time of Jesus they were an important people.

-Idumea: part of this territory was part of the inheritance that Herod the Great left to his son Archelaus, but another part was independent.

-Ascalon: independent city with its own government.

# Mount Hermon. But where was Jesus?

With so many details that _The Urantia Book_ offers about the place where Jesus remained in retirement for six weeks, it couldn't be very difficult to locate the place and get a little idea of ​​what it is like and above all, how it was.

In [UB 134:8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p8) (“The transition years”), we are told that Jesus and Tiglath built a stone deposit at a location 2,000 meters above sea level. We are also told that to get there they passed through a village then known as Beit Jenn.[^1] [^2]

It didn't take me long to find Beit Jenn on a map. In a general map of Lebanon at a scale of 1:200,000 from the French National Geographic Institute,[^3] the village appeared very clearly, which still exists today and is called Beït Jinn. Also, near the village there is a summit of 2,224 meters (but it is not the highest peak, which rises up to 2,814 meters). It was easy to assume that the ascension of Jesus referred to in _The Urantia Book_ is this “small” peak. Looking at other data, I found out that in total, from Beit Jenn, which is located at 1100 meters, it was about 900 meters of ascent to the place where they built the food deposit.

<figure id="Hermon_figure_1" class="image image_resized"><img src="/image/libano-eng-m06.jpg"></figure>
<em>The red box marks Beit Jenn, the red line the possible route of Jesus and Tiglat, and the red circle the possible site of the deposit. General map of Lebanon, IGN, France.</em>

It could also be seen on the map that from this 2,224-meter summit two streams descended to Beit Jenn, one of them following a gentler slope, which was the one that Jesus probably ascended.

A curious fact that emerges from all this is that all the extraordinary events that happened there took place in the territory of present-day Syria, not in Lebanon or Israel. It must be remembered that this northern border of Israel has been in permanent conflict.

The exact point was thus made a little clearer. But what was this mountain like back then?

<figure id="Hermon_figure_2" class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/800px-Hermonsnow.jpg"></figure>
<em> Mount Hermon seen from Mount Bental http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hermonsnow.jpg </em>

The Hermon is actually an extensive mountain range known as Jabal Ech Cheikh with several permanent snow-capped peaks and which today has a ski resort. Due to intensive logging, the lush cedar forests have been left desolate, leaving only small areas of this fantastic tree.[^4] For this reason, the photographs that some travelers have given us only show stark and lonely slopes.[^5]

To get an idea of ​​what the motley place was like in the time of Jesus, I resorted to the invaluable narration of _Caballo de Troya 6_, the best-seller by JJ Benítez,[^6] which in its final pages reproduces this ascent in amazing detail. Such luxury of details was reused by me when writing my fictionalized version[^7] of _Urantia Book_'s fourth part,in which I have been working for years. This way I reuse certain elements, as the _asherat_ (a Phoenician commemorative construction historically abhorred by the Jews) and the clearing with the cedar in the center, which appear in the work of Benítez.

<figure id="Hermon_figure_3" class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/hermon_ascension.PNG"></figure>
<em> Jesus' ascent to Mount Hermon </em>

I thought it was a good idea for my novel to make Jesus have a gesture of sincere worship before the _asherat_ monument (in _Caballo de Troya 6_ the ascension of Jesus is not narrated, but that of Tiglat and his two companions and it is Tiglat who makes the worship gesture). This gesture of Jesus gives an indication of his personal character and contrasts with the typical Jewish attitude towards these foreign monuments (see  [2 Ch 34:1-7](/en/Bible/2_Chronicles/34#v1); [Mic 5:14-15](/en/Bible/Micah/5#v14)). Kings and prophets of old times had fought to destroy these constructions, which were hateful to them for the simple fact that they commemorated a god other than Yahweh, the Jewish god. However, for the Jesus of my novel, the place where God is worshiped is the least important thing, the important thing is that all the constructions have been carried out by the hands of believers, regardless of their conception of God.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/hermon_panoramica.PNG"></figure>
<em>Panoramic view from the top of Hermon obtained with Google Earth</em>

In my novel, Jesus tells Tiglat legends about Mount Hermon. This mount was always associated in Jewish literature with mythological stories. In the _Book of Enoch_, an apocryphal from the time of Jesus, we can read:

> Then they all swore together and pledged themselves under anathema. There were two hundred who went down to Ardis, which is the top of Mount Hermon, which they called that because they swore on it and committed themselves under anathema. These were the names of their chiefs: Semyaza, who was their paramount chief; Urakiva, Rameel, Kokabiel, Tamiel, Ramiel, Daniel, Ezequiel, Baraquiel, Asael, Armaros, Batriel, Ananel, Zaquiel, Samsiel, Sartael, Turiel, Yomiel, and Araziel: these were his decurions. [1 Enoc 6:5-8](/en/Bible/Enoch/6#v5) [^8]

It is curious but this book narrates that beings come from heaven, whom the _Book of Enoch_ calls «the Watchers», descend to Mount Hermon, where they plan their way of acting towards men. A story very similar in content to what happens to Jesus on the mountain. Perhaps Jesus chose Mount Hermon for this significance, or was it a secluded spot like any other?

# Capernaum

We can safely say that Capernaum was the real home of Jesus. He is mentioned many times in the Gospels as the setting for interesting passages in his life. Nazareth, of course, was the place of his childhood and adolescence. But, if we stick to the gospels, the evangelist Matthew says it clearly: at a certain moment Jesus decided to leave Nazareth to go live in Capernaum (Mt 4:13). From that moment on, he came to regard it as his own city (Mt 9: 1).

But, what was this population like at the time of Jesus?

Luckily, we know the exact location, and not because it is populated, but because some stupendous ruins have left clear traces of history.

For my summary I will use two sources. On the one hand, the information on the website of the Studium Biblicum Franciscanum, those in charge of the excavations that are being carried out on the site. On the other hand, the opinions expressed in the recommendable book _Jesús unearthed_, by two good experts in archeology and evangelical exegesis such as John D. Crossan and Jonathan L. Reed. These authors compile a list of the ten most important archaeological and exegetical findings of recent years, and among them they place the discovery in Capernaum of a supposed “house of the apostle Peter”.

In general terms, and this is what is important, the two sources describe Capernaum in the time of Jesus, based on the archaeological finds found, as a small fishermen's village with no more than a thousand inhabitants.

And this description seems quite adequate if we examine the conspicuous absence of remains that betray an important urban nucleus.

## The site

Capernaum in the time of Jesus was located in a strategic and privileged place. On the northwest shore of the Kinneret, the Sea of ​​Galilee, about 210 m below the level of the Mediterranean Sea. It was 16 km from Tiberias (Tiberias), 3 km from Tabgha and 5 km from the point where the Jordan River empties into the lake.

The ruins extend some 200 to 300 meters longitudinally from the coast, and no more than 110 meters inland from the beach. In total the area would not exceed 60,000 square meters.

It has been uninhabited for a thousand years, although some Bedouins who occupied it building rustic barracks called it Talhum during this time.

The via Maris, or road to the sea, which the Romans converted into one of the roads of the empire, and which linked Damascus with the Mediterranean coast and the south, passed about 100 m northeast of the remains of the current synagogue. A milestone found, from a later period, in the time of Emperor Hadrian, attests to the existence of the road and its Roman importance.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/Kafar1.jpg"></figure>
<em>Ruins of Capernaum. The synagogue in the background. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Kafar1.jpg</em>

The place was especially conducive to fishing. Capernaum was situated on a coastline with an abundance of fish, which extended as far as Tabgha. A great abundance of stone tableware and furniture has also been found, which indicates the existence of a typical stone industry. Remains also testify to the existence of an industry for the production of glass vessels, as well as oil (olive presses have been unearthed). Another logical occupation was agriculture.

## Public Buildings

As for the buildings, no Greco-Romanesque remains similar to those of other more Romanized Jewish towns have been found. No remains of a wall have been found, nor of access gates to the city, nor any type of defensive building. Nor civic structures such as theaters, amphitheaters, racecourses, baths or latrines. The baths found some distance from the central population center date back to the 2nd century AD, when a more significant contingent of Roman troops was surely established in Capernaum than the one that must have existed at the time of Jesus. There is also no trace of basilicas, altars, temples, statues, and agoras or markets, nor of public inscriptions.

The only two notable buildings in the ruins are an imposing and very well preserved synagogue, and the remains of an ancient octagonal church. But both correspond to the Byzantine period. At the time of Jesus, at most, there must have been a synagogue of more modest dimensions than the one that can be seen today, located in the same place. We will return to the matter of the synagogue later.

## Streets

According to Reed and Crossan, the layout of the streets does not follow the classic cardo maximus and decumanus of Romanized towns. But if you consult the website of the Franciscans, the opposite is said. In my opinion, the Franciscan archaeologists use terms applicable to Roman-style cities somewhat loosely to explain their findings in Capernaum, mentioning the existence of a cardo, a decumanus, insulae, etc. And although there may have been several cross streets of some importance, the arrangement of the arteries does not obey an established order as occurred in the gridded Roman cities and which gave rise to the name cardo-decumano. There are also no stone pavements, running water pipes or sewers for sewage in the streets, as we find in other Roman-style cities.

## The houses

The dwellings follow a chaotic layout around large central spaces or interior patios, with narrow alleyways and tortuous crawling passageways in between. In the houses there are no remains of atriums and _triclinium_ or dining rooms of respect. Door jambs appear unsound and secure. No imported wine amphorae or _unguetaria_, small oil and perfume containers from rich people, or richly decorated oil lamps have been found in the rooms.

On the contrary, the findings found speak of a rustic, small village of humble people dedicated to fishing. Although the Franciscans have found certain domestic units which they have called insulae, they do not resemble classical Roman dwellings, with grid planning. Rather, these units are a series of rooms crowded around a single enclosed patio, belonging to a single family. In some areas, the alleys between these buildings widened to form small squares, probably places for mending nets or having sheep or goat pens.

This is indicated by Reed and Crossan:

> [] The houses of Capernaum are like those found in other Jewish villages in the eastern Galilee and the southern Golan, where the usual building materials were the dark basalt of the region, some twisted wooden beams, straw , reeds and mud. [...]

> [] La calidad de las construcciones era baja, [...]. Las paredes se levantaban sobre unos cimientos de cantos rodados de naturaleza basáltica; las hiladas inferiores que se han conservado estaban formadas por dos filas de piedras sin labrar mezcladas con cantos de menor tamaño, barro y arcilla rellenando los intersticios; y en vez de estuco o pinturas al fresco, la superficie de las paredes estaba recubierta de una capa de barro o de estiércol mezclado con paja, destinada a cumplir una función más aislante que estética.

The passage of the healing of the paralytic (Mk 2:4, Lk 5:19) evidences a type of roof in the buildings, as the authors of _Jesús unearthed_ very well point out, of little consistency. “Some wooden beams supported a thick bed of reeds that protected the logs from moisture, and all this was covered with rammed mud to obtain greater insulation.” These simple decks were normally accessible by stone stairs or wooden steps attached to an interior wall. They served as a playground for children, as a drying room for fruits, crops and fish, or as an outdoor bedroom in summer. This perfectly clarifies the passage in which the paralytic's friends make him descend into the room through a hole in the ceiling. It shouldn't be difficult to uncover part of the warp and make a hole.

The house, therefore, consisted of a large central courtyard into which several rooms led. Whole families lived, including in-laws and parents (see, for example, the healing of Peter's mother-in-law in Mk 1:29). This patio served during the long summer months as a living room, dining room and kitchen, as well as a workshop, garage and warehouse. The kitchen consisted of a simple clay oven and a stone to grind the grain and form the flour for bread. Courtyards with agricultural tools have been unearthed, such as large grinding wheels and oil presses moved by mules or oxen. In winter the whole family slept inside the rooms, usually on the floor, on simple mats, or at most on folding bunks.

As furniture, archaeologists have unearthed numerous stone vessels, but not very large: simple jugs, cups or bowls made by hand or made with the help of a small wheel. The lamps were simple, lacking in decoration, or all the more with simple floral motifs. The pottery found apparently came from the village of Kefar Hananya, in Upper Galilee, and consisted of different types of pots, pans, water pitchers and jugs. More refined objects such as plates, dishes and cups were not very frequent.

## The synagogue

Currently, in the visible ruins, you can admire the remains of a beautiful Jewish synagogue, probably the best preserved remains of a building of this type in the entire Jewish territory. However, the building dates from the 5th century. Curiously, it rests very close to where the remains of the Byzantine-era octagonal church have been found, suggesting that perhaps Capernaum, in more recent times, was the scene of a growing rivalry. between the Jewish and the Christian place of worship.

This, evidently, is not the synagogue that Jesus knew. But, could it be built on the foundations of the original that the Master did know? This is affirmed by the Franciscan archaeologists who have examined the base of the building, although this opinion is not shared by Reed.

First century synagogues were not usually special buildings. In many sites it has been necessary to assume as synagogues some houses that were adapted for such use. In other cases, some construction was carried out, but it was very simple. Crossan and Reed point out quite rightly that synagogue, in the time of Jesus, did not usually designate a specific type of building, but rather the usual assembly or meeting place to celebrate religious rites. This place did not have to be a sanctioned or sanctified construction for that purpose.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/800px-Capernaum_synagogue_by_David_Shankbone.jpg"></figure>
<em>Synagogue built on the one in the time of Jesus. http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capernaum_synagogue_by_David_Shankbone.jpg</em>

According to the Gospel of Luke, the synagogue as such did exist in the case of Capernaum (Lk 7:1-10), since the evangelist even mentions the benefactor who built it. It is clear that he is not talking about just any house or a public place, such as a square. It speaks of a concrete construction. This makes me disagree with the surprising interpretations of Crossan and Reed on this issue. For them, the absence of clear and resounding remains of a synagogue from the first century necessarily imply that there was no such building, despite the fact that the synagogue is mentioned even in other passages of the gospels (Mk 1:21, Jn 6:59) .

## The Roman Garrison

Crossan concludes that the passage in Luke in which a “Roman centurion” is mentioned as the benefactor is not a good translation of the Greek _hekatonarchos_ or with the _basilikos_ of Jn 4:43-54. That is, the entire passage is mistranslated. The centurion was not a centurion, the soldiers in charge of him could not be Romans, and in no way was he the builder of a synagogue. “During the reign of Antipas there were never any Roman officers permanently stationed in Galilee,” state the aforementioned authors.

However, I disagree with these assessments. Perhaps it was not a centurion, but it could be a position of lower rank, and Lucas calls it a centurion to generalize. The point is that he was a gentile who had a certain regard for Capernaum for having served there for quite some time, and he donated money for the construction of a new synagogue.

The following passage is quite illuminating:

> The day before the departure of the apostolic group for the feast of the Passover in Jerusalem, Mangus, a centurion, or captain, of the Roman guard stationed at Capernaum, went to see the rectors of the synagogue, […] . . . . [UB 147:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1)

Here the expression “centurion” or “captain” is used interchangeably. In other words, he was surely not a commander of legions, which was what centurion really meant in Latin terminology, but simply a leader of a small Roman detachment.

But why a Roman detachment in a town as modest and of little interest as Capernaum? Crossan's sentence is true: there were no regular Roman troops stationed in territory ruled by Antipas. Some time later there were, when much changed the attitude of Rome towards its province of Judea. So?

One possible explanation for all this, and this is how I will use it in my book, is that what this guard was actually guarding was the road or via Maris, which was indeed Roman property and not Jewish. Very probably they had their garrison along the border of the kingdom of Antipas with that of Philip, his half-brother. Its function, I believe, was to provide certain protection to the publicans, the officials in charge of demanding a toll or tribute for the transit of goods between both borders, and to ensure the safety of the road. Let us think that this road had a strategic importance: it linked Romanized capitals of that time such as Damascus and Caesarea Maritima.

This role of protectors of the publicans could be closer to the people than that of a usual military detachment, carrying out functions similar to that of the publicans, many of whom were Jews. Matthew, the apostle, was precisely one of these publicans. This explains why the “captain” had a house in Capernaum (“Lord, don't bother me. I am not worthy to have you come into my house.” Lk 7:6), lived as one of the community, and was a character beloved by the rectors of the synagogue for their donations for the new building.

_The Urantia Book_ makes a clear mention of this garrison in paper 129, section 1:

> Jesus built boats throughout this year and continued to observe how men lived on earth. He often went to visit the caravan stop, since the direct route from Damascus to the south passed through Capernaum. Capernaum was an important Roman military post, and the officer commanding the garrison was a Gentile who believed in Yahweh, “a pious man,” as the Jews used to designate these proselytes. This official belonged to a wealthy Roman family, and he had taken it upon himself to build a beautiful synagogue in Capernaum, which he had donated to the Jews shortly before Jesus came to live with Zebedee. Jesus conducted services at this new synagogue more than half the time that year, and some of the caravan travelers who happened to attend remembered him as the carpenter from Nazareth.

If it was an “important Roman military outpost,” how come no remains of Roman fortifications or camps from the time of Jesus have been found? Remains of some baths and fortifications have been found, but they seem to date back to the 2nd century. However, what are some hot springs doing next to a town as unimportant as Capernaum? There is evidence that troops were permanently stationed after the Second Jewish Revolt (132-135 AD). In my opinion, these troops were only reinforcing others that probably already existed before.

We will be attentive to future archaeological campaigns in the Capernaum area. I think there is still much to discover by the lake. But in principle, I prefer the idea expressed by _The Urantia Book_, and which confirms what is suggested by the gospels. There must have been a military camp of a certain size in Capernaum, probably located near the current remains of Roman baths, and not far from the customs house, guarding the Via Maris road.

## The caravan stop

Crossan and Reed do not even mention in passing the possibility of a caravan stop in Capernaum, even though it is confirmed that one of the most common Roman roads for travellers, the via Maris, passed through there. Nor do the Franciscan excavators of Capernaum include data in their reports that show the existence of any building intended to house caravans.

It is surprising that none of the sources takes into account that the proximity of the via Maris would logically entail a huge movement of caravans with merchandise and travellers.

The misnamed via Maris, which in ancient times was called the “Road of the Philistines”, came from Mesopotamia, linked with Anatolia and Syria, and descended towards Egypt using two branches: one went to the Mediterranean coast through Meggido, and the other continued inland through Dan (Caesarea Philippi), the Sea of ​​Galilee (Capharnaum, Magdala, and Tiberias), and the Jezreel Valley.

This makes _The Urantia Book_ idea quite plausible that there was a nearby building or esplanade, probably next to the causeway, that served as a stopping point. However, I have not been able to find any data among the consulted sources that attests to the existence of this construction.

## The customs house

Another building of singular interest is the customs or toll house mentioned in the gospels (Mt 9:9, Mk 2:14, Lk 5:27). Presumably it would be a small building, so it is easy to understand that no remains have been found to give it away, such as a building next to the road with an unusual number of coins among its remains. This building, as I have already indicated, it is logical to imagine that it had an adjacent sentry box to house the Roman soldiers in charge of protecting the money from the collections.

## Conclusions

The archaeological excavations and the analysis of the experts are clarifying very well what the Jewish environment in which Jesus developed could be like and what his routine life by the Sea of ​​Galilee could have been like. However, an examination of the excavation plans reveals that only a small area of ​​the entire potential site has been systematically excavated. I believe that future campaigns will bring to light new interesting findings.

# The «house of Simon Peter», first domus-ecclesia?

In a previous appendix we have already investigated what Capernaum could have been like in the time of Jesus, and one of the most significant remains of the ruins of Capernaum is a construction that has come to be called the “house of the apostle Peter”. The authors of _Jesus Unearthed_, Crossan and Reed, summarize the importance of this finding as follows:

> In 1906 the ruins of an octagonal building were discovered on land in Capernaum under the custody of the Franciscans. It was the Byzantine church which had become “the house of the prince of the Apostles”, of which ancient pilgrims spoke. Between 1968 and 1985 the Franciscan archaeologists Virgilio Corbo and Stalisnao Loffreda worked on this octagonal structure and its surroundings and brought to light its extremely complex strata. In the fifth century CE an octagonal church was built on top of a house-church dating from the fourth century, both of which were erected on top of a simple courtyard house originally built in the first century BC. in the second century AD a series of curious examples of Christian invocations in Aramaic, Hebrew, Greek, Latin and Syriac. Since there were no household appliances of any kind and the room had been plastered several times, the first generations of Christians must have considered the room to be important in some way. The conclusion of the archaeologists was that it was the house of the apostle Peter.

Is this building really the old house of Peter, and most likely the first Christian church in the world? This is what the Franciscans who have excavated the place seem to indicate.

The truth is that there are a good number of arguments in favor of this hypothesis:

* Remains of hooks and fishing tools have been found in the stratum corresponding to the period of the time of Jesus, which attests that the houses on which the octagonal church was later built could have belonged to a family dedicated to fishing.
* Old monograms, symbols and inscriptions have been found on the plaster of the walls. Although there is no consensus on the correct meaning of these symbols, it is possible that they are some kind of Christian marks, which attests to a ritual use of the place by the early Christians.
* References have come down to us from a pilgrim named Egeria who described the 4th century church as “the house of the prince of the apostles”, indicating that the walls of the house were left intact to better preserve the original appearance.
* A pilgrim from Piacenza who visited Capernaum about 570, wrote: “Item venemus in Capharnaum in domo beati Petri, quae est modo basilica” . . . .
* The house is especially spacious. This seems to agree, according to the Franciscan archaeologists, with the Gospel indications that Simon Peter lived with the family of his brother Andrew and with the family of his mother-in-law (Mt 8: 14-15, Mc 1: 29-31, Lk 4: 38-39).

However, I think it is very difficult to decide in the affirmative on this question. As we know, it is quite possible that Peter died in Rome, and that his brother Andrew was also executed far from Galilee. Presumably Pedro took his wife and children with him, which leaves Pedro's house without occupants a few years after the Master's death. Most likely, Peter sold his house before dedicating himself to preaching the good news throughout the world, as Jesus had asked them during his appearances after his death. In addition, the general idea among the first Christians was that the end of time was near, that Jesus would return shortly to carry out the definitive and final judgment.

If we read everything about Peter in the book of the Acts of the Apostles, we clearly perceive that Peter does not seem to have returned to Capernaum for a long and prolonged period, but already forever. We see him in Jerusalem, where he does not appear to be the leader of the community, since he is sent to Samaria to confirm new believers (Acts 8:14). We next see him in the pagan capital of Samaria, Caesarea, where he initially had qualms about mixing with the Gentiles. Finally, he had to return to Jerusalem to explain his preaching among foreign peoples.

For those of us who credibly read _The Urantia Book_ there are many other possibilities for ownership of the Capernaum church-house. These are the ones I have found:

* La casa de Felipe: el apóstol era natural de Betsaida y vivía con su familia en Betsaida ([UB 139:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_1)). Aunque tradicionalmente se ha situado a Betsaida en la otra orilla del mar de Galilea, _El Libro de Urantia_ ofrece una visión bastante distinta sobre dónde estaba localizada esta misteriosa población, de la que espero poder ofrecer un apéndice con mis conclusiones.
* The house of Zebedee: the father of the apostles James and John lived in a spacious and spacious house by the beach, with his wife, his son John and their daughters ([UB 129:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_4)). This was the house where Jesus stayed during the time he stayed in Capernaum. But this house was not in Capernaum, but on the outskirts, near Bethsaida. The fact that this house was in the outskirts, in the open country, was due to the fact that Zebedee's extensive shipyards would be nearby. This makes more logical what is told in _The Urantia Book_ about a tent camp where the many believers who came to listen to Jesus gathered ([UB 148:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/148#p0_1)).
* James Zebedee's house: It was also located on the outskirts of Capernaum, near his parents' house ([UB 139:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_1)).
* David Zebedee's house: it seems that he had his own house also located on the outskirts of Capernaum, near his parents' house ([UB 138:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p5_4)).
* Peter's house: The apostle and his family lived with Andrew, his brother, who was single, and his mother-in-law ([UB 139:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p2_1)). Peter's house, we are told, was near Zebedee's ([UB 145:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/145#p2_15)), so it was probably in Capernaum, but in the southwestern part of the city.
* Matthew's house: although the apostle had his place of work in the customs house, it is clearly mentioned to us, even in the gospels, that Matthew invited Jesus to his house, which would most certainly be in Capernaum. In addition, the lucrative job as a publican would surely allow Matthew to have a good house in the small town ([UB 139:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p7_1), [UB 138:3.1-4](/en/ The_Urantia_Book/138#p3_1)).
* The house owned by Jesús where his mother, the family of his brother Santiago, and his sister Ruth lived: this house is mentioned to us as a modest “little house”, with only two rooms, that is, two rooms that surely shared a patio common ([UB 129:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p2_4)).
* The house of the Roman centurion, Mangus: house in which finally Jesus did not have to enter, amazed at the great faith of the man: «Lord, I am not worthy that you enter my house. But one word from you will heal him” ([UB 147:1.1-4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p1_1)). He must have been quite a wealthy person to make the donation for the construction of the synagogue. It is not unreasonable to think that his house was large, spacious, and located in a place not far from the synagogue that he promoted.
* The house of Jairus, one of the rulers of the synagogue: Jesus supposedly cures the daughter of this wealthy man from Capernaum, who after that becomes a believer ([UB 152:1.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/152#p1_1) and [UB 154:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p1_2)).

Assuming that the location of Capernaum is correct, and that the currently visible synagogue, from the 5th century, is built on the foundations of the one sponsored by the Roman centurion, all the houses that are mentioned in _The Urantia Book_ as being located on the outskirts of Capernaum , or in Bethsaida must be discarded. This excludes the house of Philip, that of Zebedee, that of his sons James and David, and that of Peter. Therefore, according to _The Urantia Book_, the basilica-church that was built in Capernaum was not on the former house of Simon Peter. Most likely, the first pilgrims spread this idea to give a more sacred importance to the place. In fact, at the time of which we have references of the pilgrims Peter is already called the “prince of the apostles”.

But in my opinion, it was. The dimensions of the house on which the octagonal church is located are quite large for a family of modest fishermen. On the other hand, we have already seen that the evangelical evidence never places Peter in Capernaum again. Most likely the apostle never set foot in his ancient city again, selling his estate and following Paul to Rome, where he died. I doubt very much that four hundred years later Christian believers of that generation would remember where Peter's dwelling had been and build a simple basilica there, and later a church.

My idea, which may be totally crazy, of course, is that the house on which the church stands was owned by Mateo, or by Jairus, or was the house of Mangus, or was simply the house of an unknown Jew whose descendants they eventually sold it to devout Christian Jews and built a church. But I see it unlikely that it was really Pedro's. Perhaps he would not object if the house were smaller and located further from the synagogue.

Matthew, the publican apostle, disappears from the map in the Acts of the Apostles. We have no news of him anywhere. But if he really was the one who wrote the gospel that bears his name, and he wrote it in Aramaic, as the experts say, it is very possible that he remained for some time in a quiet place and away from intrigues where he could devote himself to writing. Matthew could therefore be one of the apostles who stayed for a time in Capernaum. His comfortable position makes him ideal for having a large house, and for celebrating banquets like the one he offered to Jesus according to the Gospels. However, if we go by _The Urantia Book_, we are told that Matthew ended up in misery and that he went to preach in Thrace, where he died. If this story is true,

Jairus, the wealthy synagogue ruler whose daughter Jesus supposedly rescued from death, and who must have become a follower of Jesus, is a strong candidate. The fact that he was rich agrees very well with the dimensions of the house that has been found below and with the fact that the walls were plastered and plastered several times over the years. The plasters were only made by wealthy families. The house of a simple fisherman would be made of exposed stone with brushstrokes of mortar covering the cavities. On the other hand, it is logical to think that the house of the former rector of the synagogue was located near it, as is the case (the synagogue and the remains of the church face each other). Furthermore, Jairus, being wealthy and having a responsible position among the Jews,

Mangus, the Roman centurion, could be another possible candidate. It is obvious that he was rich. His generous donations for the construction of the synagogue prove it. He too must have been a convinced believer. Even Jesus came to say of him: “I have not found such great faith in all Israel.” He very possibly was a loved person, despite being Roman. He must have been a Roman turned Jew, a “proselyte.” Surely his family lived there forever, and in the generations to come they would be considered as Jewish as anyone else. In addition, the simple basilica that was built during the fourth century must have been the work of Jews with Gentile influence. The basilicas were typical Roman constructions, but not Jewish.

Finally, another logical option is that of an unknown Jew who was never heard of in the pages of history. Why not?

If we think about it, it was much less attractive for the “tourists” of the Byzantine era to say that the famous basilica of Capernaum rested on the remains of someone's house, compared to how different it sounded to say that Peter's house was right there . The interest that this was Peter's house did not lie in the apostle, but in the fact that it has always been assumed that Jesus lived in Peter's house while he was in Capernaum. This made the church the place where Jesus himself lived. However, the gospels never clearly express this idea. Only that Jesus was in that house on several occasions.

Obviously, what pilgrims have always sought is to make a place sacred, to make it special by ensuring that “someone distinguished” lived or died or was buried there. And they have not hesitated to use a place and rely on the most remote justifications to reach the desired conclusion. I am inclined to think that this is what happened in Capernaum.

Theories aside, I think it is very difficult to rigorously decide on a solution. But what I do have clear is that archeology is used too often for “tourist” and “religious” purposes, quickly opting for a possibility when it is of interest. It is enough to see how money has been spent for the construction in Capernaum of a beautiful modern church on the ruins of the old octagonal one, while the same is not done to continue unearthing the site. Archeology sometimes seems more of an end in itself (reaching a preconceived conclusion) than a means of elaborating 'possibilities'. And in the end, what happens is that we are no closer to the truth.

And before finishing an interesting anecdote for the readers of _The Urantia Book_. Has anyone noticed that the octagonal church has a plan that is actually three concentric circles? Is it that this symbology was already present in some way in the iconography of the primitive Christian community? If so, it is a very interesting fact, which will be worth investigating...

# The lost city of Bethsaida

Bethsaida is one of the most mentioned towns in the gospels. However, even today experts argue about its correct location. Surprising hypotheses are considered, such as that in reality there was not a single population called Betsaida, but two. In this appendix we will summarize all the evidence and arguments that have been found around the possible locations, we will compare them with the mentions of Bethsaida in _The Urantia Book_, and we will draw a conclusion that will serve us for the writing of _Jesus of Nazareth_. The end result, as you can see, has been unexpected and interesting...

We will study three types of evidence: the ancient texts that have come down to us with references to Bethsaida, the geological studies of the Sea of ​​Galilee, and the archaeological finds found so far. Then we will examine the conclusions that different experts have reached over the last two hundred years of research.

## Literary evidence

First of all, Bethsaida is mentioned 7 times in the gospels:

> [The passages before and after allude to the fact that Bethsaida, along with Capernaum and Chorazin, were the places of greatest activity for Jesus. That makes us suppose that these places must have been very close to each other.] -- Woe to you, Corozain! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been done in Tire and Sidon, they would have been converted long ago, dressed in sackcloth and sitting on ashes. Matt 11:21.

> [The passages before and after allude to the fact that Jesus and his disciples sailed from a “desolate place” (his name is not mentioned here) and that although they were going in the direction of Bethsaida, contrary winds caused them to land at Gennesaret.] Then He ordered his disciples to get into the boat and go before him to the other shore, in the direction of Bethsaida, while he sent the people away. Mark 6:45.

> [The above passages allude to Jesus and his disciples sailing from “the region of Dalmanuta” to the other shore, where Bethsaida was.] They arrived at Bethsaida and presented him with a blind man, asking him to touch him. Mark 8:22.

> [The mention does not clarify its location.] On the way back, the apostles reported to Jesus everything they had done. He took them with him and withdrew to a lonely place, to a city called Bethsaida. Luke 9:10.

> Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the miracles that were performed in you had been done in Tire and Sidon, they would have been converted long ago, dressed in sackcloth and sitting on ashes. [Luke 10:13. Identical to Mt 11:21.]

> [He doesn't say anything about his location.] Felipe was from Bethsaida, the town of Andrés and Pedro. John 1:44.

> [ Here Bethsaida is clearly identified with a population of the kingdom of Galilee, that is, in the territory of Herod Antipas.] They approached Philip, who was a native of Bethsaida of Galilee, and said: Lord, we would like to see Jesus . John 12:21.

The Jewish historian Flavius ​​Josephus mentioned it several times:

> He also [Philip] advanced the village Bethsaids, situate at the lake of Gennesareth, unto the dignity of a city, both by the number of inhabitants it contained, and its other grandeur, and called it by the name of Julias, the same name with Caesar's daughter.
> 
> He [Philip] also raised the town of Bethsaida, situated on Lake Gennesaret, to the status of a city, adding inhabitants and securing fortifications, and named it Julias, the same name as Caesar's daughter. [AH 18:2.1]

It seems that the change of name of the town took place around the year 30, the year of Jesus' death, but we do not get its location from here.

> when it [the Jordan river] hath run another hundred and twenty furlongs, it first passes by the city Julias, and then passes through the middle of the lake Gennesareth; after which it runs a long way over a desert, and then makes its exit into the lake Asphaltitis.
> 
> when [the river Jordan] has traveled another hundred and twenty stadia, it first passes the city of Julias, and then passes through the middle of Lake Gennesaret; then it runs a long way through a desert, ending at Lake Asfaltitis. [BJ 3:5.1]

From the description he seems to be saying that Julias, ancient Bethsaida, was situated before the mouth of the Jordan in the Sea of ​​Galilee.

Rabbinic literature also mentions it. It is usually spoken of as “Saydan”, but on many occasions these mentions are not clear. At that time the city of Sidon had the same Semitic root (_saidan_ or _saidon_ means fisherman). But a couple of mentions do seem to hint at a location:

> Rabbi Yehoshua brought “Saydan's pheasants” to Emperor Hadrian as one of the three proofs that the land of Israel was not without luxury. Introduced from Asia, pheasants became a part of local agriculture. [Midrash Ecclesiastes Rabbah 2:8]

> Patriarch Shimon Ben Gamaliel remembers how one day in Saydan, he was given a basket containing three hundred kinds of fish. [Jerusalem Talmud, written in Tiberias, Shekalim 50a, chap. 6, halakah 2]

Bethsaida was a city of talmudic sagas, including Abba Yudan (Gurion) of Saydan, and Rabbi Yose of Saydan (4th century), a fisherman by profession. He was known as Yose Hahorem, that is, Yose the Sweeper, because he artfully used the _herem_ or dragnet, a type of net widely used in the Sea of ​​Galilee.

Bethsaida is also mentioned, as such or as Julias, in non-Jewish sources. In the 1st century Roman historian Pliny the Elder refers to Julias and Hippos as “enchanting cities on the eastern shore of the lake”. The 2nd-century geographer Ptolemy places Bethsaida among the cities of Galilee, although he does not specify where.

Ancient pilgrims from the Holy Land have also left us references in their writings to the mysterious city.

Theodosius (6th century) describes the route of the sacred places on the west coast: «Two miles from Tiberias is Magdala; two miles farther are the Seven Springs [Tabgha]; two miles farther is Capernaum; six miles from Capernaum is Bethsaida." In addition, the pilgrim Theodosius comments in his diary that Bethsaida was not only the place of origin of Simon Peter and Andrew, but also of James and John. Where did he get this information, which is not in the gospels?

Around 725, Willibald, an Englishman who became a bishop in Germany and was later canonized, also visited the lake's holy places. Fifty years after his visit, he dictated his memoirs to a nun, who put them in writing. Willibald spent a night at Bethsaida, and claimed to see a church at Bethsaida on the site of James and John's house. We know that at Capernaum there was a church, the ruins of which have been found, and that pilgrims refer to this church as standing on the site of the house of the “prince of the apostles,” that is, of Peter. What is this church then? No archaeological remains of any church have been found at the alleged sites of the experts.

The pilgrim Theodoric wrote in 1172 that the Jordan River flowed between Bethsaida and Capernaum, and a 12th-century map shows Bethsaida on the eastern shore of the lake.

Some 13th-century travelers speak of a “Bethsaida of Galilee” on the west shore of the lake near Tabgha. In 1564 a Portuguese traveler, Pantaleón de Aveiro, wrote that he went from Tiberias to Bethsaida and there found a small settlement of Jewish fishermen. A Jewish immigrant from Portugal played host to him, and fed him fish. Did you visit D'Aveiro Tabgha, an excellent fishing spot, according to Sea of ​​Galilee expert fisherman Mendel Nun?

On the Palestine Exploration Fund map drawn by Major Claude Reignier Condor about a hundred years ago, two Bethsaids are shown, one to the east of the lake and the other, marked with a question mark, to the southwest of Tabgha, at the site of the Khan Minya, where today is the pumping station of Israel's National Water Carrier.

## Analysis of the passage of the multiplication of the loaves and fishes

As we have seen, none of the literary evidence clearly and unmistakably places Bethsaida in a location. The references are too diffuse and fit multiple interpretations. While the evangelist John speaks of a Bethsaida in Galilee, so it should be on the west shore of the lake, Josephus clearly places it east of the Jordan.

Perhaps the most complete Gospel account that helps us investigate the site is the supposed miraculous feeding of the multitude through a few loaves and fishes. The passage is one of the very few fragments that has an equivalent in all four Gospels (Mk 6:30-56, Mt 14:13-34, Lk 9:10-17, Jn 6:1-21).

If we make the assumption, which may be wrong, that the four evangelists are well informed of what happened and tell the story without making mistakes, we can try to unite all the variants in a single story, which would follow the following scheme:

1. The disciples arrive and tell Jesus about their progress (_Mc_ and _Lc_).
2. Jesus asks them to go alone and go by boat to a deserted place (_Mc_ and _Mt_), in the direction of Bethsaida (_Lc_), on the other side of Tiberias (_Jn_).
3. The people see them leave and follow them (_Mc_, _Mt_, _Lc_ and _Jn_), going on foot along the coast and arriving even before Jesus and his disciples (_Mc_ and _Mt_).
4. Jesus teaches the crowd and then feeds them through a miraculous multiplication of loaves and fishes (_Mc_, _Mt_, _Lc_ and _Jn_).
5. The crowd tries to proclaim Jesus king (_Jn_).
6. He asks the disciples to leave (_Mc_ and _Mt_) while he retires to a mountain to pray (_Mc_, _Mt_ and _Jn_).
7. The disciples march by boat in the direction of Bethsaida (Mc), across (_Mt_), to Capernaum (_Jn_).
8. The contrary wind prevents them from advancing (_Mc_, _Mt_ and _Jn_).
9. Jesus walks on the waters (_Mc_, _Mt_ and _Jn_), invites Peter to do so (_Mt_), and gets into the boat (_Mc_ and _Mt_).
10. They arrive at their destination (_Jn_), but it is finally Gennesaret (_Mc_ and _Mt_).
11. _Jn_ is the only one who comments in a later passage that the crowd follows them in boats, finding Jesus again in Capernaum.

Many exegetes have seen a great contradiction between the boat trips described in _Lc_ and in _Mc_. Luke says that Jesus and his disciples went to Bethsaida, but Mark says that they went to a deserted place and from there they returned to Bethsaida. How is it possible? Did they start and arrive at the same place?

The exegetes who did not see a contradiction in these passages elaborated the theory of the “two Bethsaidas”, that is, that there were two cities called Bethsaida. One on the west coast, probably a simple fishing village, and another on the east coast, larger, and which was raised to the category of city by Philip establishing his residence there, renaming it Julias. And it is a theory that, as we shall see, explains many things very well.

## Geological evidence

Geological studies of the Sea of ​​Galilee carried out by experts differ so markedly in their conclusions that it is clear that something is wrong with some of the approaches.

According to the archaeologist Mendel Nun, an ancient fisherman on the lake, and one of the most expert people in the ancient fishing customs of the Sea of ​​Galilee, in the time of Jesus the level of the Sea of ​​Galilee was lower than it is today, so the coastline, in the north, was further away than it is today. The justification he offers is the formation, a thousand years ago, of a second mouth to the south.

This new mouth, located a kilometer and a half further south, competed to channel the waters for several hundred years. During this time, the old channel became clogged, while the new channel, which was narrower, was unable to empty the annual floods of the lake, so the sea level rose little by little, until it was one meter below above the previous maximum level.

The rising water began to flood the less sheltered fishing villages, as was the case of the port of Hippos, now Kefar Akavya, or the port of Gadara. In the area of ​​el-Araj, where Mendel Nun proposes the location of it for Bethsaida, the erosion and destruction was the greatest, since the plain of Beteiha, where el-Araj is located, was the most unprotected area of ​​the lake.

According to geologist John F. Schoder and geographer Moshe Inbar, both from the team that claims to have discovered evidence that et-Tell is the correct location, in the time of Jesus there was a succession of situations that took the coast of the Sea of ​​Galilee from the vicinity of et-Tell up to 2 km! beyond. To do this, they use the conjunction of three theories: an elevation of the surrounding land caused by tectonic movements (the «shore-up» model), an extraordinary deposit of materials eroded by the surrounding streams (the «shore-out» model) and finally, although not as significant, a lowering of the waters of the Sea of ​​Galilee. In other words, at the time of Jesus the water level was higher! to the current

Although the archaeological evidence, as we will see below, indicates that many ancient ports, dating from Roman times, lie under the water, these experts only speak of “fluctuations” in the physiognomy of the coast, as if it were the surrounding terrain. he moved and it was not the water that rose or fell.

How is it possible so much disparity between the opinions of the experts? According to Mendel Nun, the water level has risen during the last two thousand years, it has done so along the entire coast, and there have been no large-scale sedimentations in the el-Araj area. According to Schoder and Inbar, the water level has dropped, and the different sedimentations in various areas of the lake would be the explanation, together with elevations of the land, that in some areas the ports are under water, and in others, as in et- Tell, too high.

Clearly some of these views are incorrect. But why is the shape of the coast so important in Jesus' time? This interest is due to the fact that a conclusive proof of the physiognomy of the coast could rule out a site. In the case of el-Araj, if the water level were shown to be higher, that would imply that it could not be the site of Bethsaida, leaving only et-Tell as the only possibility.

## Archaeological evidence

For now, the only thoroughly excavated site is the hill of et-Tell, a mound about two km northeast of the mouth of the Jordan in the Sea of ​​Galilee. Here a team led by archaeologist Rami Arav has unearthed remains from the Early Bronze Period, the Iron Age, and the Greco-Roman era. The archaeological remains found from this last period are incontestable: there was a population on that hill during the time of Jesus. The pottery and coins found confirm this. Remains of fishing tools have also been found, but as Mendel Nun very well criticizes, they are not even remotely significant. The usual thing in a seaside town should have been hundreds of net sinkers and many more objects.

As for constructions, it must be said that the dimensions of et-Tell are ridiculous for the great city that Josephus tells us that Bethsaida became when it was renamed Julias. Josephus mentions that the city was enlarged, and that its defensive walls were reinforced. However, according to the maps that accompany the second volume of Rami Arav's discoveries at et-Tell on a CD, the dimensions of the city could not have been more than 210 m by 90 m. Even the dimensions of the ruins of the small village of Capernaum are larger! In addition, of the defensive walls, no trace. How, then, can the et-Tell team affirm that this was the Julias of Josephus?

A house from the Roman period has been unearthed with a large courtyard and only two large side rooms. This physiognomy of a home does not coincide at all with the typical dwellings huddled around a simple patio in the ruins of Capernaum. Besides, I doubt 20 houses like that would fit on the site. But even so, the optimistic archaeologists of et-Tell still make room for a Roman temple and a possible palace.

They claim to have discovered evidence of an old dock to the southwest of the hill, but that is nothing more than a wall next to a natural pool formed by a fountain. A wall has nothing to do with a breakwater, they are two completely different types of construction, so I do not see so clearly that this wall was part of the port of ancient Bethsaida.

As for other sites, the only one that has been proposed as an alternative is el-Araj. However, the excavations carried out at this site have been shallow and have been promptly abandoned. El-Araj is a narrow flat strip of land along the coast, east of the mouth of the Jordan, easily flooded and marshy, forming part of what is known as the Beteiha Plain.

The first investigation of the north shore of the Sea of ​​Galilee conducted after the 1967 Six-Day War and the exodus of the Syrian Army was carried out between July and August 1973 by Dan Urman, the secretary of the Association of Archaeological Expeditions. From Israel. Urman then reported that at el-Araj, several Arab buildings stood on top of ruins and structures dating from the Greek and Roman periods. «In the place you can distinguish the tops of walls, architectural elements, and also a public building. A stupendous Corinthian capital was also discovered at the site."

In 1987, the et-Tell team conducted a survey at el-Araj. The trial was conducted during March and April, when many wetlands are flooded, so there was little land to choose from. A 4 x 4 meter square was taken as a test, finding remains only from the Byzantine period and later. With this shallow and biased essay, the team led by Rami Arav decided that el-Araj should be discarded as a site for Bethsaida, and they focused exclusively on et-Tell. Despite numerous targeted campaigns at et-Tell, no new trials at el-Araj have been conducted by this team to date.

A more recent investigation of the ground at el-Araj, under the Israel Antiquities Authority, was carried out in the fall of 1990 by a team led by Yosef Stepansky. According to an addendum by Mendel Nun, a member of the team, Stepansky wrote in his report:

There are ancient ruins on the mound in the center of the site (from the Greek to Crusader periods), which have been investigated and described many times. The present investigation recorded architectural elements that had not been previously reported, including a piece of a basalt frieze. Remains of ancient buildings were searched to the north and northwest of the mound and rubble from the early Roman period (Herodian lamps and terra sigillata bowls) and late Roman period was collected. These findings indicate that the identification of the place with Bethsaida cannot be excluded.

Mendel Nun continues his exposition indicating that remains of round buildings were found, about 5 m in diameter, perhaps watchtowers. Also remains of a heart shaped column, typical of Jewish synagogues, as other sites have attested. It should be noted that not a single architectural remains have been found in et-Tell that would suggest the existence of a synagogue.

Mendel Nun assures that el-Araj, which is just a thin strip in front of the coast, hides the ruins of ancient Bethsaida below, and that even under the waters there are still more remains that were flooded. Because the area has become swampy, excavation is complicated and time-consuming. Perhaps this is the reason why no systematic archaeological excavation has yet been carried out in this area, which may be hiding some ruins of invaluable interest.

## Theories of the experts

The sites of et-Tell and el-Araj have been well known since the heyday of biblical archaeology, at the beginning of the 19th century. What did the most famous archaeologists say about this dubious matter of Bethsaida?

Edward Robinson, considered one of the fathers of biblical archaeology, in 1838, identified et-Tell as Bethsaida Julias, but also firmly maintained the existence of a second Galilean Bethsaida in Tabgha! Where did the idea of ​​Tabgha come from? Most likely, Robinson accepted the four Gospel accounts as good, and therefore supported the theory of the two Bethsaids.

The Frenchman Victor Guérin, in 1875, agreed with Robinson in identifying et-Tell with Betsaida Julias, but added that el-Araj must have been a port suburb of the city.

In 1884, Laurence Oliphant, an English Christian Zionist based in the area, saw significant remains at both el-Araj and et-Tell, but favored neither.

Some years later, Gottlieb Schumacher testified again that there were some very significant remains in el-Araj. He even saw foundations of considerable size and the causeway of a Roman road that seemed to lead to et-Tell, which made him think that et-Tell could be the site of Philippi's palace, and rule out et-Tell as a fishing town, although he established a possible link through gaps between the two sites.

Around 1912, Gustav Dalman, after visiting the area, concluded that et-Tell must have been a kind of acropolis of Bethsaida and the site of Herod Philip's palace, and that there must have been a Roman road linking et-Tell and the -Araj.

In 1929 Rudolf de Haas visited the place and described how an Arab resident in the area had discovered a very beautiful Roman mosaic, which he did not hesitate to show him, but shortly after he had to cover it again so as not to endanger his own home. De Haas considered only the possibility that Bethsaida was el-Araj, but also stated that et-Tell could be connected by water to the coast.

En 1946 Karl-Erich Wilken realizó una visita en la que pudo constatar la existencia, a escasa profundidad, de numerosos restos romanos de la época de Jesús. También afirmó que et-Tell debió ser la residencia de Filipo, pero que la ciudad propiamente era el-Araj.

Sólo en los últimos años ha surgido con fuerza la hipótesis de et-Tell, gracias a los numerosos hallazgos descubiertos allí por el consorcio dirigido por Rami Arav, y a la ausencia de investigaciones serias en otras zonas.

However, the archaeologist Mendel Nun, who discovered the old docks of the ports during a prolonged drought in the 1980s, has raised a critical voice against this exclusionary position, assuring from various appendices that the ruins of Bethsaida are still waiting under the waters of el-Araj.

As we can see, these two centuries of research have never ruled out any site as valid. There was irrefutable evidence that placed both sites in the time of Jesus.

## My conclusion

It has not been easy for me to come to a conclusion because the more one reads about this fascinating subject the more doubts arise about the election. However, I have come to a certain degree of satisfaction with a possible solution.

First of all, I don't support the idea that Bethsaida was just a town. At the time of Jesus it was very common for there to be nearby cities with the same name. For example, in those times there were two cities called Julias, two Caesareas, two Bethlehem, two Bethany, etc. In my opinion and following some of the ancient archaeologists who started the idea, there were two Bethsaids.

It is only through the existence of two towns called Bethsaida that the gospels make sense. It could happen that one evangelist was wrong, but not all four at the same time. To describe one of the Bethsaids, Mark and Matthew speak of a “desolate place” (Mk 6:32, Mt 14:15), but Luke expressly says that it was Bethsaida (Lk 9:10), and John places it on the coast this, because it says that it was on the other side of Tiberias (Jn 6:1). This Bethsaida where they go first would be Julias. To describe the other Bethsaida, Mark expresses it clearly by saying “Betsaida, on the other shore”, that is, the west (Mk 6:45), Matthew only says “on the other shore”, but John is emphatic and affirms that “towards Capernaum” (Jn 6:16). This second Bethsaida should therefore be near Capernaum, where according to John the crowd finds them the day after.

In my opinion, the Bethsaida located on the west coast was called “Betsaida of Galilee”, as the evangelist John says in Jn 12:21, or simply “Saydan”, as in the rabbinical treatises. It was located in what is now Tabgha, where very clear remains of an ancient wharf from the time of Jesus have been found. Tabgha turns out to be located between Gennesaret (current Guinosar) and Capernaum, coinciding very well with the Gospel account. It was from this Bethsaida that the family of the apostles Andrew and Peter came, the family of Philip, and also the Zebedee family, as the first pilgrims attested. One more reason to understand Jesus, that he chose as his first followers a group of acquaintances (since Capernaum was so close to Bethsaida they would undoubtedly know each other). Furthermore, due to the proximity to Capernaum,

This western Bethsaida I conceive of as a modest Capernaum-style village or even smaller, with about 700 to 800 inhabitants, and very dependent on Capernaum. Only three kilometers separate one from the other, which means about forty minutes or an hour on foot. Perhaps Bethsaida did not have its own synagogue and the neighbors flocked to the one in Capernaum. It was like a kind of suburb or suburb of Capernaum, but due to being located on a coastal strip especially fruitful for fishing, it remained for a certain time as a population center.

As for the Bethsaida located to the east, I think that it was located in el-Araj, as Mendel Nun affirms. But this Bethsaida was practically irrelevant to Jesus. There he hardly preached, he did not perform miracles, and everything else was in the surroundings, but in an “open space”. This place fits very well with el-Araj. South of el-Araj there are hardly any remains of docks for a few kilometers, which indicates that with the exception of the city of Bethsaida there were no other important towns nearby.

This eastern Bethsaida was the great city called “Julias” that Herod Philippus enlarged during the life of Jesus, until it became the capital of his tetrarchy and his habitual residence.

The city, situated on the plain opposite el-Araj, was to be grandiose, in the style of Tiberias, the city of the half-brother, Antipas. A large defensive wall had to protect all the flanks of the city, fitted between circular defensive towers like those described by some archaeologists. Philip would probably have a large palace, his residence, within the city walls.

So what's in et-Tell? Well, in my opinion, the least important thing in the whole story. Simply, a temple in honor of Caesar in the style of the one in Caesarea Philippi, with some adjoining rooms, and the mausoleum of Herod Philippi, where he was buried in 34 AD We must bear in mind that this son of Herod was a king who he proved on many occasions to be very grateful to the Roman rulers. The temples in honor of Roman gods or the rulers themselves were very typical. This reminds me of an inscription about the city of Pella, next to the Jordan, in which there is a drawing of a temple on a nearby hill. The promontories or high hills were ideal places to locate a religious center. Probably a causeway would connect with the “acropolis”, as some archaeologists have very well described.

How then to explain all the findings found in et-Tell? Well, the few fishing gear found clearly speak of offerings or objects carried by the locals, but not of continued use in-situ. Interestingly, one of the most significant finds has been a small ritual shovel for incense, a very common object in temples for making offerings. The good number of coins is also affirming that quite a few transactions were managed there, probably as a result of the business of the existing temple. But nothing more. This place should not have had any special significance for Jesus, much less for his apostles. That is why the team of archaeologists who work there have not found any remains of a church in the area, as the ancient pilgrims used to say. Nevertheless, there are “three” important churches next to Tabgha, some with really old mosaics. Very probably under the foundations of one of these churches are the remains of the house-church supposedly in the home of “Santiago and Juan Zebedeo”, according to ancient pilgrims.

And _The Urantia Book_? Many passages from _The Urantia Book_, although you have to be careful and locate them carefully, offer a vision of the location of Bethsaida. And they completely agree with my conclusions.

According to [UB 129:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/129#p1_4), “Zebedee was a moderately wealthy man; his shipyards were on the edge of the lake south of Capernaum and his house was situated on the shore of the lake near the fishing center of Bethsaida». In [UB 139:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_1), Andrew's father, “now deceased, had been a partner with Zebedee in a fish-drying business in Bethsaida, the fishing port of Capernaum.” In [UB 139:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p3_1), James “was married with four children, and lived near his parents in Bethsaida, outside of Capernaum.” Furthermore, when _The Urantia Book_ mentions one Bethsaida and the other, there are no doubts because it uses Bethsaida to designate the one located to the west and Betsaida-Julias to designate the one located to the east. The proximity between Bethsaida and Capernaum explains,

In short, as I see it, the two Bethsaidas, and not one, that should have existed, are still waiting for the shovels and brushes of the archaeologists. In my opinion, the team working on et-Tell is wrong in their effort to show these ruins as the city of Bethsaida-Julias, and I think they should pay the same attention to el-Araj. Also, why has no one excavated at Tabgha, where remains of an ancient wharf have been found?

Interestingly, from my conclusions I draw the circumstance that Jesus' Bethsaida, the one he visited most frequently, is not even a concern of archaeologists today. All current discussion focuses on whether the correct site is et-Tell or el-Araj. But the theory of the two Bethsaids, which was widely accepted by early researchers, now seems to be forgotten without all the possible sites having been thoroughly excavated. Although there are some ruins of a wharf in front of Tabgha, no one seems to have bothered to survey for building ruins in the vicinity. All the archaeological excavations in Tabgha stick to the foundations of the existing churches, as far as I have read.

But I am sure that one day, new findings will finally determine who was right in all this controversy...

# Tariquea

The first mentions of Tariquea recall that a naval battle took place there during the Jewish war against the Romans in 67 AD that ended bloodily with the death of many of its inhabitants and the sale of more than 30,000 of them into slavery. These mentions come almost entirely from the historian Flavius ​​Josephus, but his statements seem to contradict each other.

In the War of the Jews we read:
> «So Vespasian sent his son Titus to Caesarea Maritima to bring the forces remaining there to Scythopolis, the largest city of the Decapolis, not far from Tiberias, where the two met. Advancing at the head of three legions, he encamped three and a half miles from Tiberias, at a post in sight of the rebels, called Senabris." [_BJ_ III : 9.7]

On this occasion, the rebels were the people of Tiberias, who wisely decided to surrender when they met three Roman legions at the gates of their city. It must be remembered that a legion was made up of sixty centuries, and each century of one hundred men commanded by a centurion, which totaled 18,000 men. In addition, Tito commanded a cavalry group of 600 men and Trajan another of 400 men.

With Tiberias surrendered, Vespasian then turned his attention to Tarichea, where many of the most stubborn rebels had dug in, fleeing Tiberias and the neighboring cities. According to Josephus this city, “like Tiberias, is situated at the foot of a mountain, and on both sides where it is not bathed by the sea (of Gennesaret), it had been strongly fortified by Josephus, although not as strongly as Tiberias.” (_BJ_ III: 10.1).

## The Battle of Tariquea

The Battle of Tariquea began while Vespasian was still organizing his defenses. He had ordered the construction of a defensive wall, in anticipation that the capture of Tariquea would be difficult for him. But then, one of the Tariqueo rebels, named Jesu (Jesus), together with a group of brave volunteers, sailed by sea to the enemy lines to attack those who were carrying out the tasks of building the wall. It was a gesture of courage that did not last long. The Roman legionnaires repelled the attack, forcing the Taricheans to fall back against the beach, retaking the boats and moving out of range of the arrows out to sea.

While this was happening, Vespasian learned that the bulk of the Tarichean troops were preparing to attack on the plain in front of the city, so he sent his son Titus with the 600 cavalry to disperse them. But soon his son realized that they were outnumbered and asked his father for reinforcements. He sent a new contingent of 2,000 archers commanded by Antonio and Silo “to surround them against the mountain of the city, and repel those who were on the walls.” Trajan, with his cavalry, also joined the charge, which made Tito harangue his men so that they could take all the glory of the fight, since with such reinforcements the victory would otherwise be less than admirable. . This harangue aroused such fury in Tito's men that they swept away the tariqueos,

Really, only a small minority wanted to fight against the Romans, the rest had been swept away by force and fear. Seeing the situation advantageous, Tito entered the city on horseback with his troops, riding on the waters. Terrified at the audacity of the Roman general, many fled. Jesu and his acolytes put the sea in between. Others tried to follow in his footsteps by setting out to sea in boats. But it was their undoing, because they came face to face with the Romans, who massacred them.

Those who managed to enter the water, watched from afar as their city was taken, and got as far away from the “enemy as they could”. Upon receiving news of Tarichea's surrender, Vespasian entered the city with his entire army. “The next day,” he sent out hastily constructed launches after the fugitives. According to Josephus, “there was an abundance of wood and carpenters were not in short supply.” This reference, together with the one that indicates that there were a large number of ships, makes us suppose that Tarichea was one of the famous shipyards on the Sea of ​​Galilee.

Josephus says that the Jews were “surrounded” by land. It is not clear if he means that all the coastal towns of the Sea of ​​Galilee were conquered, or that they were within a space smaller than the Sea of ​​Galilee, a kind of port between wide breakwaters. Because he clearly mentions that it was “the next day” that the pursuit of the escapees began, which would be strange if they had fled out to sea. In that case they would have been given a full night's head start, enough time to make a slippery landing on any deserted beach.

Finally, the Romans found the boats, annihilating all its occupants. The slaughter reached 6700 inhabitants of the city, including those who were killed in the population.

## Current archeology hypothesis: Tariquea = Magdala. It's correct?


With these references, the geographers of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries placed Tariquea on their maps in the area south of the Sea of ​​Galilee (for example, Hasting's Dictionary of Christ and the Gospels, 1906, and George Adam Smith's Historical Geography of the Holy Land, 1894, from the Palestine Exploration Survey). But later, several authors began to make hypotheses that identified the ruins of Magdala with Tariquea. The idea that led to this other solution is based on the description of the facts made by Flavius ​​Josephus, according to which he comments that Vespasian advanced with his troops from Scythopolis in the south to Tiberias in the north. Scholars have surmised that Vespasian used the coastal road to the Sea of ​​Galilee, and thus if Tarichea were south of the sea,

So, which hypothesis is the correct one?

As we can see, the positions are basically based on the following assumptions:

__Hypothesis A : Tariquea = Magdala (north of Tiberias)__

* Vespasian advanced along the coastal road so he should not have crossed Tariquea.
* The city had a mountain in front, and this happens in Magdala, approximately.
* Tariquea means “place of fish conservation” and it is known that an industry of this type existed in Magdala.

__Hypothesis B: Tariquea = south of the Sea of ​​Galilee (south of Tiberias), in a place called today Khirbet el-Kerak or Bet Yerah.__

* Vespasiano advanced by the plain of Esdraelón, reaching Tiberias by the west without crossing with other populations in rebellion.
* The city had a mountain in front. Indeed, the entire southwest of the Sea of ​​Galilee is a steep rise that plunges abruptly into the waters of the lake.
* Remains of several jetties have been discovered in the southwestern Sea of ​​Galilee, suggesting that not one, but several settlements existed in that area.

Personally, I am much more inclined to the second hypothesis, which curiously is the one adopted by the first researchers of the previous centuries. The reason is that I find much more arguments in favor of this hypothesis when examining the orography of the Sea of ​​Galilee. I have been able to consult topographical maps of the sea coast, and one thing that stands out is that the south-western coast is pronouncedly steep, with a mountainous spur bordering the lake for a few kilometers, leaving hardly any space to drive along the coast (the current road runs a few meters from the water). It is somewhat strange to imagine that a great strategist and military man like Vespasian crossed the ancient coastal road with his troops through that area of ​​the lake to appear before Tiberias, with great danger of being ambushed. It seems more logical to imagine that they followed a route farther from the coast to climb to the crest of the nearby elevation to surprise the enemy from above. Thus it seems to describe that the Tiberians saw the Romans arrive, so that the sight of the troops frightened them so much that many fled without putting up a fight. On the other hand, the mountain that we have in Magdala is already much less pronounced than in the southern location planned for Tariquea. The so-called Genesaret plain begins in the current ruins of Magdala, an area where several streams flow into the lake and the coast widens considerably. Thus it seems to describe that the Tiberians saw the Romans arrive, so that the sight of the troops frightened them so much that many fled without putting up a fight. On the other hand, the mountain that we have in Magdala is already much less pronounced than in the southern location planned for Tariquea. The so-called Genesaret plain begins in the current ruins of Magdala, an area where several streams flow into the lake and the coast widens considerably.

The so-called Genesaret plain begins in the current ruins of Magdala, an area where several streams flow into the lake and the coast widens considerably.

Another reason to take into account is that Josephus speaks of an important town, with a racecourse and other unique buildings, in the style of Tiberias (_Autobiografía_, XXVII). He comments that it also had defensive walls, built under the patronage of Josephus himself (_Autobiografía_, XXIX; here the reasons that led Josephus to its construction are also described). However, neither of these two ruins have been found in the Magdala excavations. Neither the remains of a wall nor the remains of a racecourse have appeared.

Emil Schurer lets us glimpse in his History of the Jewish people that Tariquea was one of the towns that marked a toparchy in Galilee. Since Tiberias was the capital of the other toparchy, it doesn't make much sense that Herod Antipas would build Tiberias so close to Magdala (both a few miles apart) if it were Tarichea. It makes more sense that it was further away, in the south. In this way each would be the center of one of the toparchies of Galilee.

Also, why call Magdala Tariquea when Magdala already had a common name? According to the experts who today defend the identification of the two populations, “Tariquea” means “place of fish conservation”, and by references it is known that in Magdala there was a fish canning industry. These industries, in fact, were found throughout the Sea of ​​Galilee, giving the sea world fame, so that even outside the region it was known for this industry.

In any case, practically all current scholars and historians seem to agree that Tariquea is actually another name for Magdala, and that there are no longer reasons to doubt this location, which is surprising in view of the fact that there are more than reasonable doubts to settle the matter.

## The excavations

Excavations in Magdala have brought to light remains that seem to indicate that a fleet of ships existed there, and that some type of confrontation took place, judging by the remains of arrows found. However, there is no trace of a hippodrome or solid walls, nor can the remains found be linked to the naval battle described by Josephus.

As for the excavations at Khirbet el-Kerak or Bet Yerah, they have been very scattered and not very continuous over time, and have concentrated a lot on bringing to light remains from the ancient bronze age, but little from the period that concerns us. . However, remains of an ancient city of about 20 ha with a fortification 8 m thick have been found. Could these be the foundations of a later fortification, the wall that Josephus mentions for Tariquea?

The site of this excavation is perfect to explain some of the passages in Josephus. Apparently, in recent centuries, the mouth of the Sea of ​​Galilee in the Jordan River has been moving south. Formerly, in the time of Jesus, this mouth was further north, right next to the site of Bet Yerah. This could explain why Josephus described Tarichea as a city surrounded by water on two sides. Perhaps it was due to the meander that the Jordan formed at its exit from the Sea of ​​Galilee, surrounding the city on two of its sides. He also explains that Titus's cavalry could enter the city riding on the water. They must have ridden over a shallow Jordan. To all this, it should also be added that during a considerable drought in the 1980s,

## The Urantia Book

_The Urantia Book_ is emphatic when it comes to fixing Tariquea's location. Just as for other sites it does not offer many clues, here it does not offer any doubt, as if the authors took it for granted that it does not admit discussion. In document 139:8.2 it says: "[Thomas] had previously been a carpenter and mason, but later became a fisherman and resided at Tarichea, on the west bank of the Jordan, where the river flows from the Sea of ​​Galilee, and was considered himself the most important citizen of this small village.

Of course he is describing the enclave of Bet Yerah, but it is striking that he refers to Tariquea as a “small village”. Would a small village have a wall and a racecourse?

La única explicación que encuentro si creemos que el testimonio de _El Libro de Urantia_ es cierto, es que la población no era muy importante en tiempos de Jesús, y que carecía de muchas de las edificaciones que luego menciona Josefo en sus escritos. De hecho, hay que notar que Josefo, como indicamos más arriba, afirma ser quien construyó los muros de Tariquea (ya hemos dicho que pudo utilizar como base los de una muralla antigua). Por tanto, en tiempos de Jesús, es bastante probable que Tariquea no estuviera fortificada. Una suposición similar nos hace pensar que el hipódromo y otras construcciones fueron una aportación posterior a la aldea, que con el paso de los años se convirtió en una ciudad populosa. Hay que pensar que entre los sucesos de la vida de Jesús y los de la historia que cuenta Josefo transcurrieron más de treinta años.

Pero nada de todo esto es concluyente. Tampoco en Bet Yerah han aparecido los restos de un hipódromo. Por tanto, ¿dónde estaba Tariquea? ¿Cómo puede una construcción como un hipódromo desaparecer sin dejar rastro?

Personally, I think that the only place where a racecourse could have existed and that today there is no trace is at the mouth of the Sea of ​​Tiberias. The important processes of erosion and sediment transport that have occurred in the area would explain the cleanliness of the site and the scarcity of remains. If there had been a racecourse in Magdala, it should be easy to locate its location.

Therefore, I believe that we will have to wait for future archaeological campaigns to bring to light the definitive discovery that will fix once and for all the location of ancient Tariquea.

# want

Queresa's name is very confusing. This population appears in different sources under very different names: sometimes it appears translated as Gergesa, but since more recent times as Kursi or Chorsia. The latter are more reminiscent of the English transcription of Queresa, which is Kheresa.

Be that as it may, the origin of this site must be sought in Mt 8 28-34. Here the evangelist tells us: “When he reached the other shore, in the region of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men came out to meet him from among the tombs.” He then recounts the well-known miracle of Jesus in which he casts out a legion of demons and herds them into a herd of pigs, which rush into the lake.

However, in the parallel accounts of Mk 1:5-20 and Lk 8:26-39, “_gerasenos_” is said instead of “_gadarenos_”, opening the possibility of three places: Gadara, current Hammat Gader, a remote town a few kilometers southeast of the lake, on a rise; Gerasa, the current Jerash, located in the interior of Jordan; and finally Kursi, a site located six kilometers north of Kibbutz En Gev, on the eastern shore of the Sea of ​​Galilee.

The location of Gadara and Gerasa seem ruled out if we believe the Gospel account. Both towns are a few kilometers from the sea, Gerasa quite a few more. Therefore, it is impossible that the herd of pigs fell into the sea from a precipice. However, the last site, Kursi, gained added validity when during the construction of a road in the 1970s, the remains of an ancient Byzantine monastery appeared in the area. Finally, all the experts have come to accept that Kursi is the location of the ancient population referred to in the gospels.

## Archaeological finds

The site is located at the mouth of a stream in the Sea of ​​Galilee, called _nahal_ Shamak. The valley is therefore called the Shamak valley, and it is also often referred to as the el-Kursi valley. This valley opens up a fairly flat area between the steep hills on the eastern shore of the lake, which drop quite abruptly into the sea. The discovery of this site was due to a stroke of fortune by the Sea of ​​Galilee expert, Mendel Nun, while he was observing the progress of the construction of the road. This researcher was also able to observe, during the prolonged drought of the 1980s, the remains of a breakwater and a pier that evidenced the existence of an ancient fishing population.

The remains of a hundred plumb lines that were used in the time of Jesus to ballast the nets and a water storage tank of about 3 meters on each side, apparently used to keep live fish (a fish farm perhaps?), as well as very clear remains of the Roman period, they left no doubt that we were facing a site from the time of Jesus.

All this, together with the discovery of the well-preserved remains of the Byzantine monastery, with mosaics commemorating Jesus' miracles of healing the demoniac and the multiplication of the loaves and fishes, seem to indicate that the place was considered from ancient times as the place of the miracle of the possessed.

The stories of ancient pilgrims attest to the existence of this monastery. It was built in the 5th century. Along with the monastery facilities, some baths have been found, a type of building not common in Byzantine monasteries, at least in Israel. Archaeologists think that it could have been part of an inn for pilgrims, but speculations are diverse and inconclusive.

The monastery was attacked and destroyed in the Persian invasion of 614. Later (636), Christians were allowed to return to the site and continue to live according to their customs. It was finally destroyed in an earthquake on January 18, 749 and abandoned.

The latest archaeological excavation campaigns (2001-2003) have focused exclusively on the monastery and its surrounding outbuildings. However, of the ancient city that must have existed here, hardly anything has been excavated. It is another of those lake towns that have been erased over time. So how can we imagine this ancient population?

## The Queresa of the times of Jesus

First of all, it must be said that I call it Queresa because this is the name used by _The Urantia Book_. In addition, it is a name that avoids confusing her with Gadara or Gerasa. The English name, moreover, Kheresa, is even more similar to the current name of the site, Kursi.

 “Kursi” seems to recall the Arabic “_kursa_”, which means chair, perhaps because the valley opens a gap between the hills with that shape. The Greek _choiros_, which could also be related to the population, means “pigs”, and we are told that there was a pig farm in the region.

It may not be surprising to the uninformed reader, but the fact that the Gospels mention pig farming in this region is quite indicative of the type of population that Queresa could have been in the time of Jesus. The pig was one of the animals prohibited in the diet by Jewish religious legislation. Therefore, only pigs were fattened in the Gentile cities, whose population, Greeks, Syrians and Romans, appreciated the meat of these animals.

Therefore, Chaeresa was quite surely a mainly gentile town, which was also close to Hippos and Gadara, two important towns that were part of the capitals of the Decapolis, the league of independent and gentile cities located in the heart of the world. Jewish territory. The influence of these nearby cities must have been obvious.

From all this I tend to draw the conclusion that Queresa was a small gentile town, of Western customs, with a certain Jewish and Greek mixture. However, I see it not as a big city, but rather as a fishing village, in the style of Capernaum. The stone with which the Byzantine monastery is built, of the dark basalt type, is identical to that used in the houses of ancient Capernaum. Also, the pig farms would not be close to the city at all, because of the smells. Rather, we deduce from the Gospels that they were situated on top of nearby hills, far from population centers. But the fact that these farms existed in the vicinity shows that there was a certain gentile permissiveness towards this type of industry.

A somewhat strange aspect of the Gospel account is the precision with which the event of the pigs is told. We are told that “the whole herd rushed over the precipice into the lake and the pigs drowned” (Mt 8:32). The other evangelists express themselves in a similar way. However, how was this possible? I have studied the orography of the eastern shore of the Sea of ​​Galilee, and I do not find any precipice with the waves of the lake crashing at its feet. The eastern hills are indeed quite steep, but they drop off and then there is a flat strip of land. Also, the fall is not vertical. There is a kilometer from the upper plain to the water's edge. Did the pigs roll down a whole kilometer? I find it totally unlikely.

Did the Sea of ​​Galilee once have precipices by the water? According to the geological evidence provided by archaeologists such as Mendel Nun, the water level at the time of Jesus was a few meters below the current level, as evidenced by the remains of piers from that time. According to this researcher, in addition, there has been no significant erosion of the surrounding hills that would justify the removal of ancient cliffs. However, other authors, such as the archaeologists who work with Rami Arav in the excavation of et-Tell, assure that the changes in the coastline of the Sea of ​​Galilee have been very remarkable and heterogeneous in different parts of the coast.

_The Urantia Book_ goes even further into the idea that there was a precipice that fell into the waters:

> Although most of the nearby eastern shore of the lake sloped gently up to the highlands behind, at this particular location there was a steep slope where, in places, the shoreline dropped suddenly into the lake. [UB 151:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p6_1)

> As the swineherds rushed into town to spread the news that the lunatic had been tamed, the dogs charged a small herd of about thirty swine that had been left behind, driving most of them over a precipice into the sea . [UB 151:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/151#p6_6)

Everything seems to indicate that without a doubt the waves of the lake broke at some point on the coast against an almost vertical slope. Although it is surprising if we contemplate the current orography. Furthermore, if so, the eastern rim could only be flanked by climbing a zigzag path to the top, then descending on the other side of the precipice. If this ravine really existed, it must have cut off any possible causeway that linked the eastern coast.

An unanswered issue that I leave open for future research, when we reach the point in the story related to the miracle of Jesus.

# Pella

## History

Although the site was inhabited as early as the fifth millennium BC and Egyptian texts make several references to it in the second millennium BC, it was during the Greco-Roman period that Pella flourished. The original name of the city, Pihilum or Pehel, seems to have been changed, according to Estefano Byzantium (5th century), when the city was refounded by Alexander the Great. Alexander Jannaeus captured it, and since he was unable to persuade the inhabitants to accept Judaism, he destroyed it (Flavius ​​Josephus, _BJ_ I, 5 8; _AJ_ XIII 15 4). Pompey rebuilt it and annexed it to the province of Syria (_BJ_ I, 7 7; _AJ_ XIV, 4 4). It became part of the Decapolis, always remaining a Hellenistic city, and forming part of the northern border of Perea (_BJ_ III, 3 3). As part of the kingdom of Agrippa, it offered refuge to the incipient Christian community of Mount Zion, which, under the leadership of Simon, sheltered there during the Jewish revolt and the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans (Eusebius _HE_ III, 5; Epiphanius _Haer_ XXIX , 7). When after three years of war and massacres the second Jewish revolt was suppressed by the Romans (132 - 135 AD), and the emperor Hadrian rebuilt Jerusalem under the new name of Aelia Capitolina, a part of the community that lived in Pella moved by order of the uncircumcised Bishop Mark, going to Mount Zion. In any case, Christianity in Pella persisted, as testified by Aristo (born there in the 2nd century, and author of the _Dialogue of Jason and Papiscos_) as well as the discovery of numerous Christian tombs and some inscriptions. that under the leadership of Simon, he sheltered there during the Jewish revolt, and the siege of Jerusalem by the Romans (Eusebius _HE_ III, 5; Epiphanius _Haer_ XXIX, 7). When after three years of war and massacres the second Jewish revolt was suppressed by the Romans (132 - 135 AD), and the emperor Hadrian rebuilt Jerusalem under the new name of Aelia Capitolina, a part of the community that lived in Pella moved by order of the uncircumcised Bishop Mark, going to Mount Zion.

## Archeological ruins

The ruins of Pella can be visited in the vicinity of present-day Tabakat-Fahil, near the Jordan, on the east bank, and approximately at the same height but on the opposite side as Scythopolis or Beth-Shean.

The walled city ran between two elevations, one not very high to the north, and another more pronounced to the south. Some inscriptions found on coins indicate that a temple could have existed on top of this last promontory. These coins reveal the physiognomy of the city in their engraving, showing a main colonnaded cardo, many houses, some on the slopes of the hill, and some temples inside.

Two ravines or wadis that surround both hills, the _wadi_ Malawi surrounding the southern hill (today called _tell el-Husn_), and the _wadi el-Hammeh_, surrounding the northern hill, were to flow into the central valley where it extended. the city, today called _wadi Jim el-Moz_.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/pella.png"></figure>
<em>Pella</em>

Little exists in the current ruins that tells us about the time of Jesus in particular. While the temple located in _el-Husn_ has already disappeared and was not replaced by any construction (perhaps the hill was cursed by the presence of that temple), it is nevertheless easy to find remains of the Christian presence (such as several churches) or even Arabic (a mosque).

However, there are quite good remains of some of the Roman constructions from the time of a just later period, in what is called “the civic complex”, that is, a series of constructions where the administrative centers of the city would be arranged: a temple, a basilica with a well-preserved staircase (which later became a church in the Byzantine period), a small theater or odeon built on the southern side of the basilica, and a Roman _nimpheum_ or public baths. Right next to these great buildings were the springs with which the city was well supplied.

The excavations, carried out by a team from a university in Sydney, Australia, have yielded little since they began their belated journey in 1983. One of the most notorious discoveries has been the remains in the vicinity of a large ancient Canaanite temple (32 x 24 m), of the type called _migdol_ or fortress, dated around 1600 BC The work of these excavations has taken archaeologists to the present, so there have been no new finds of interest in the area of ​​the "complex civic » out of those already visible.

## Importance of Pella

That Pella had an essential importance in the birth of Christianity is undeniable for scholars. Substantial evidence has come down to us that a continuous Christian population lived in this city, it had bishops, and it had several very old churches whose remains have come down to us.

But what perhaps no one finds in the history books is the special relationship that Jesus lived and also his immediate disciples with this population. If we turn to _The Urantia Book_, Pella is mentioned as the real place where John baptized Jesus, and not the fords of the Jordan to the south or north that are currently offered to tourists. Near Pella Jesus spent that period of isolation for forty days, and not in the Judean desert, which is much further south. The first place where Jesus and his disciples stopped for a time to begin their public preaching was near Pella, right where John had camped. In reality, Pella became, much more than Capernaum, the authentic center of operations of the missionary activity of Jesus, coming to house a camp of some five thousand people, a fully organized authentic city of tents. Pella is where Jesus delivered some of his most memorable speeches, and finally it is where the apostles took refuge fleeing from Jerusalem when the Roman troops invaded the country in the 1960s. All this information explains very well why this place became time in a Christian center of great importance.

It is curious to note that in the end, the potentially most suitable place for religious tourism has only become a pile of ruins, in favor of other more dubious places.

# The cave of forty days

Sometimes there are references in _The Urantia Book_ that stand out for their accuracy and specificity. They seem to be placed there so that someone would bother to verify them, or perhaps with some hidden intention that I still cannot understand. But when I began to write the chapter on Jesus' period of isolation after his baptism, the famous “forty days,” I couldn't resist the temptation to investigate Jesus' whereabouts during that period.

> During these extraordinary days, Jesus lived in an ancient rocky cavern, a refuge in the side of the hills, near a village once called Beit Adis. He drank from the little spring that gushed out at the foot of the hill near this rock shelter. [UB 136:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p4_12)

This passage from _The Urantia Book_ was so striking that it seemed to be crying out for investigation.

First of all, Pella had to be located and then see if there is currently a village that could vouch for the name of Beit Adis.

Pella couldn't be hard to locate. As far as she knew there are still some stupendous ruins of the city in the vicinity of a town known today as Tabakat-Fahil. But my 1:200,000 scale maps were insufficient to locate either of them. I needed more accurate maps, so I spent hours on end trawling the internet.

Suddenly a little blessing: http://sunsite.berkeley.edu:8085/jordan/50k/3154_4.jpg

I don't know if this link is public or not, but the point is that as of today it is available, and above all, it contains scanned maps at a 1:50,000 scale, the best I have found. And if you look on the map, it doesn't take long to appear, very clearly, Tabaqat Fahl. It is at the intersection of the coordinate line 46 vertical and 94 horizontal.

You can see, in the proximity, that two positions with ruins (Ruins) are noted on the map. They are the remains of ancient Pella.

And Bet Adis? Is there a town with a similar name today? There it is, clear and evident on the map. It is called Beit Idis, and it is located at the intersection of quadrants 54 vertical and 92 horizontal. It seems from the graphics of the cartography that it is nothing more than a small village. Nearby there are orchards (Orchard), which proves that the village has water for irrigation, undoubtedly coming from several nearby springs that fall from the east to the west.

If we take a look at the map we can easily see from the reading of the contour lines that from Pella to Beit Idis (Beit Adis) everything is uphill, going from less than 200 m in Pella to more than 500 m in Beit Idis. And the hills to the east of this village rise up to 800 m.

Yes, but where is the cave where Jesus took refuge? There is no indication or symbol on the map to locate it. All we can do is roughly locate the site. _The Urantia Book_ says that near the cave there was a spring where Jesus drank. Indeed, on the map we can see that there are several springs falling from the eastern slopes near Beit Idis. It could well be near one of those springs where the sought-after cave was.

That's about as close as you can get to locating that cave using maps. To find her, it would be necessary for someone to travel to Jordan and start looking for her. Has anyone done this trip before?

Back on the Internet to search, I find this gem: http://www.planetabenitez.com/misenigmas/lacueva.htm.

For those of us who believe in the revelations of _The Urantia Book_, this article by journalist and writer JJ Benítez is deeply moving. I do not know if the Spanish author was the first person to discover the more than probable location of the cave in which Jesus took refuge. But of course he is the first to divulge this information to the public, which is undoubtedly impressive. In the television series _Planeta Encantado_, JJ Benítez even shows the location of the filming of the chapter entitled _The buried message_.

The location of the cave is, according to Benítez's account, on the eastern slopes of Beit Idis, as we had well assumed from reading the maps. According to the description, it is a natural cave about 15 m long, 6 m wide and 3 m high. Next to it is a spring that has now been conveniently secured with a metal cover. Of course, all the indications fit with what is mentioned in _The Urantia Book_.

Having discovered the real cave, we can say that this place represents one of the most memorable places in the life of Jesus. This natural cave may be, despite its lack of beauty and its dirtiness, the most sentimental and emotional place for all who are followers of Jesus. There are many temples that commemorate the most representative events in the life of Jesus, but possibly none like this natural temple.

It is appreciated that the place has remained unknown and unknown to believers until today. Let us hope that future generations will leave the place as it is and that if the number of believers in the revelations of _The Urantia Book_ grows, it will remain intact in its wild freedom, there lost in those hills, for those who wish to search to find it.

Regarding the discovery by JJ Benítez of a hook to hang beams, supposedly old, it has allowed me to sneak a little wink into the story.

Pero al margen de todas las demás consideraciones, yo extraigo una duda de todo este asunto de la cueva. ¿Por qué los autores de _El Libro de Urantia_ nos regalan esta pista tan espléndida de la ubicación de la cueva y no lo hacen con otros lugares? ¿Acaso deseaban compartir con nosotros un lugar de especial significación espiritual?

# What was Nazareth like in the time of Jesus?

Nazareth is an obligatory stop on any route related to the life of Jesus. It appears many times in the Gospels (although never in the Old Testament), mentioned as the city where Jesus lived as a young man.

Therefore, the need arises to seek information that gives us an idea of ​​what this town was like in which Jesus lived for so many years. I will follow the narration provided by _The Urantia Book_ in order to outline some general lines of knowledge about what the city could have been like. I will also use the narration that the journalist JJ Benítez makes in his best-seller _Caballo de Troya 4 y 5_. Finally, we will contrast this information with the data provided by modern archeology about the city.

## Nazareth according to _The Urantia Book_

Details about the location of Nazareth and Jesus' house are found in [UB 122:6](/The_Urantia_Book/122#p6) (“The Birth and Childhood of Jesus,” section 6, “The House of Nazareth”).

We are told that Nazareth was located in a valley between high hills. The valley followed the current main direction of the city, from northeast to southwest. Following this direction, but on the eastern bank, ran the road to Capernaum - Cana - Sepphoris - Nazareth - Meggidó. This road, the “road of the sea” or via Maris, was a popular caravan route through Galilee to the south and north. On this road, at the height of Nazareth, there was an important caravan stop, which made Nazareth a privileged place of passage for foreign people and merchandise.

The range of hills to the northwest is mentioned in [UB 126:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p1). Described here are the spectacular views enjoyed by young Jesus on his frequent treks to the summit. _The Urantia Book_ says that this hill was once a place of Baal worship, and that it contained the tomb of a prominent Jew named Simeon. Interestingly, the current name is Nebi Sa'in (_nebi_ apparently means prophet). Perhaps an ancient prophet named Simeon? There is no record of it. Nor have I been able to confirm the discovery of a tomb on this hill in Nazareth.

As can be seen, the Nazareth that _The Urantia Book_ draws is an elongated city, following the direction of the valley. He places Jesus' house not in the city, but in the northern part, on the outskirts.

_The Urantia Book_ calls it a “city” and not a village or small town (as JJ Benítez does). In fact, there is a strong discrepancy between the vision offered by _The Urantia Book_ and JJ Benítez's novels about the size and importance of this population in the time of Jesus. According to _The Urantia Book_, in document 124, “Galilee was a prosperous province of flourishing industrial cities, with more than 200 cities with a population of more than 5,000 inhabitants and 30 cities with more than 15,000 inhabitants.” It is obvious to think, due to the strategic location of Nazareth, that it would be counted among those 200 cities. Therefore, the population of Nazareth cannot be estimated at 300 to 350 inhabitants, as JJ Benítez does in _Caballo de Troya 4_, p. 164. The author is probably guided by the conclusions of modern archaeology,

If we follow the narration of _The Urantia Book_, we obtain a vision of Nazareth that breaks a little with the vision that archeology has been able to reveal. Nazareth is drawn as a large population, with a good number of inhabitants, probably between 5,000 and 10,000 inhabitants. A not insignificant figure. This figure makes the expression “on the outskirts” more meaningful as a description of the place of Jesus' house. If Nazareth had been a small hamlet of barely thirty houses with very few inhabitants, it is incomprehensible that it was a regular stopover and repair place for caravans, nor that Joseph would have built his house far from the “urban” center. The general description of _The Urantia Book_ tells us more about a small city and not a town, which had its own synagogue (not a house that served as a synagogue), with workshops for the supply and repair of caravans, located next to a caravanserai where many travelers from all over the known world would stay with their pack animals. Jesús lives on the outskirts because the populous “downtown” of the city must have been too expensive for José to buy a house. In fact, towards the end of _The Urantia Book_ paper 126, we are told that Jesus “played many times with the idea that all (his family) could live on a farm in the country, where they could enjoy freedom and independence of an unfettered life. Doesn't this give the feeling of being the typical longing for the countryside that an inhabitant of a big city might have? Isn't it a little strange that a person who lives in a small village longs for the ”countryside"?

According to _The Urantia Book_, José's workshop and the parts stores for the caravans should be located to the east, next to the road, on the outskirts of the town, and not far from the source that supplied Nazareth, which also it is mentioned as situated in the eastern zone. We can get an idea of ​​this area as the “industrial” part of the town, where the jobs of other artisans such as the blacksmith, the stonemason, the tanner, the ropemaker or the canvas manufacturer would probably also be available.

Another fact from _The Urantia Book_ that offers a vision of Nazareth as a “city” is that of [UB 123:5.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_12), where it is commented that Nazareth was one of the 24 priestly centers of the Jews, with more liberal priests than in the rest of the Jewish territory. This implies that priests lived in Nazareth, which clearly shows that Nazareth was not to be a small village but rather a relatively populous city, with wealthy families among its inhabitants.

The image below shows a schematic that locates the references offered by _The Urantia Book_.

<em> Nazareth according to The Urantia Book </em>

## Nazareth according to current archeology

If we turn now to current archaeology, the evidence points in the opposite direction. Not a large number of remains from the time of Jesus have been found in present-day Nazareth. The city is today a populous city of more than 40,000 inhabitants, which with its growing urbanization has practically erased many of the possible vestiges of that time. Interestingly, archeology has unearthed finds from the Bronze Age, more than 5,000 years ago, attesting that Nazareth is a thousand-year-old town whose existence is lost in the past.

The findings found reveal that there are no indications to consider that Nazareth had a synagogue at the time of Jesus. The remains found speak of a synagogue in a later period. No significant remains of buildings or constructions from the 1st century have been found either. There have only been significant finds regarding what would be silos, deposits, or underground mangers. Apparently, many homes in Nazareth had cellars and rock-cut caverns where grain, wine, and oil were stored, or where animals were kept.

This absence of remains makes the archaeologist Jonathan L. Reed and the exegete John D. Crossan, in their book _Jesús unearthed_, propose a vision of Nazareth like that of JJ Benítez, as a village of about two hundred inhabitants dedicated exclusively to agriculture, in a rustic environment away from the influence of the main trade routes.

One of the arguments in favor of this vision derives from the fact that Nazareth is not mentioned in the Old Testament, nor in the rabbinical writings, nor in the books of the Jewish Flavius ​​Josephus. The latter, who acted as a military leader in Galilee during the Jewish uprising of 66-67 AD, names 45 towns in Galilee in his writings, but never Nazareth.

However, Reed and Crossan do not overlook the discovery in Caesarea Maritima, in 1962, of an inscription from the third or fourth century, in which Nazareth is mentioned for the first time in a non-Christian source. This fragment, and two others unearthed with it, contain a list of the traditional places where Jewish priests settled after Emperor Hadrian expelled all Jews from Jerusalem in AD 135 Of the 24 priestly families who cared for the temple from Jerusalem, the Hapizzez family, the 18th, is mentioned as having settled in Nazareth. The authors recognize that Nazareth, therefore, must have been a suitable place for the priests to take refuge at that time. But how could a small village of about 200 inhabitants, so insignificant that it is not even mentioned in any source? What kind of comforts could such a small town offer to people as distinguished as an entire priestly family? Here the affirmation of _The Urantia Book_ that Nazareth was a priestly center, and that it had a certain population, seems correct.

The authors of _Jesús unearthed_ also confess that the absence of remains of synagogues from the 1st century is a frequent situation in archaeological excavations throughout Galilee and Judea. Although there are notable exceptions in some populations that were not characterized by a special development. The clearest example is the small city of Gamla, in the Golan. It has the best remains obtained from a synagogue from the 1st century, while other more important towns, of which there are remains, do not clearly show the location of a synagogue. In short, the size and importance of a population cannot be determined by the mere fact that archeology has not found the remains of a synagogue.

Does this absence of archaeological finds mean that one has to conclude that the synagogues in the time of Jesus were an exception? Unfortunately, that seems to be the position of scholars. If no archaeological remains are found, it is because they did not exist. For Reed and Crossan the situation is clear: Nazareth had no synagogue. What happens then with the evangelical stories, in which we are told on several occasions of a synagogue? Crossan easily resolves: the gospel account is a later invention of the evangelist Luke. That is, Jesus was never in a synagogue in Nazareth.

I personally believe that the absence of archaeological finds says nothing. Simply, there may not be any embers because the passage of time has eliminated them. From where there is none, it is impossible to extract, no matter how good an archaeologist one may be. It is the discovery of remains that reveals things to us, not the absence of them. Drawing conclusions when we have nothing to base ourselves on is hitting the blind spot.

But among the recent archaeological finds, we find a prominent discovery: an area with turrets and grape presses that has opened up new evidence about Nazareth in the time of Jesus.

The finding in question was made during a visit to the Nazareth hospital in November 1996 by Stephen Pfann. Pfann found pottery remains from the early and late Roman period. Excavations in the area carried out in February 1997, under the patronage of the Israeli Antiquities Authority, have uncovered stepped agricultural terraces on the slopes, with a grape press, watchtowers, olive grinding stones, irrigation and an old quarry, all from the Roman period, the time of Jesus. The watchtowers and the excavated winepress have been a very curious discovery, because they give a reason for the parable of the murderous farmers (Mt 21:33), in which Jesus speaks of these towers and this type of winepress.

The findings have given way to an interesting project to create a unique theme park dedicated to recreating life and customs in ancient Nazareth from the time of Jesus.

All these discoveries suppose to end at least with the emptiness of discoveries on the time of Jesus, bringing to light precious data on the agricultural life in his time and in his surroundings, life to which very possibly he had to be accustomed. However, these findings do not tell us anything about religious life (if the synagogue existed or not), or about social life (if Nazareth was really on a caravan route and how much population it had). Reed and Crossan make no mention of the existence of this caravan route. Perhaps there is no evidence of this, but there are many old maps that locate a frequent road in the time of Jesus passing through Nazareth. Nor do they mention anything about a priestly center in Nazareth, even though strangely, Evidence has been found that places an entire priestly family in Nazareth in the second century. Too few clarifications for some data that I think give more of themselves.

Despite all these findings, the Nazareth that current archeology reveals to us does not coincide, today, with the revelations of _The Urantia Book_. In light of the excavated remains, Nazareth appears to be a small town that lived in anonymity until it was rescued from oblivion by Christianity. According to _The Urantia Book_, Nazareth was a prosperous city located in a strategic enclave, on the caravan route, an exceptional position for a singular character like Jesus, who would be attentive to the news of the world.

## The importance of Nazareth in the knowledge of Jesus

Why was it so important whether or not Nazareth had a synagogue, whether or not it was a priestly center, or whether caravans from the East stopped there? How does it affect our view of Jesus?

The vision of Nazareth is important because it allows us to draw immediate conclusions about Jesus' way of life, about his personality and about who he really was.

For example, Reed and Crossan end up stating in _Jesus Unearthed_ that Jesus could not read or write, and that he lived ignorant of the world and foreign countries.

> But Luke also takes it for granted -and this is the most important thing- that Jesus was not only a learned person, but also an educated one. He did not simply “become teaching” in the synagogue (Mk 6:2), but “rose to read” (Lk 4:16). Luke, who was an educated man, evidently takes it for granted, as many modern scholars do, that Jesus could read and write and that he was an educated man. It is quite unlikely that he was.

Since they draw a tiny Nazareth, far from the main routes, and since there is an emptiness of the remains of a synagogue, they suppose that the knesset (synagogue) did not exist, that therefore there were no scriptures or scrolls with the sacred texts in Nazareth, and that therefore, since there were no scriptures, Jesus could not receive an education in reading and writing.

What these two scholars do not explain is how Jesus can appear in the Gospels entering the synagogues, opening scrolls and reading. How is it that there is a passage in the gospel in which Jesus begins to write in the sand in front of a woman's accusers. Nor is it very easy to understand how Jesus got into an argument with the doctors of the law when he was thirteen years old.

The importance of the knowledge of Nazareth is vital, as can be seen, to better understand the life of Jesus and who he was. By describing _The Urantia Book_ as Nazareth as a small town with a synagogue, and with a copy of the scriptures, it is easier to understand that Jesus was raised, like many other Jews, in an urban environment, in which reading and writing were part of daily necessities. It is easy to understand that he entered the synagogues and could easily read the “Hebrew” of the scriptures and translate it into Aramaic for the audience, which was the preferred language. It is easier, in short, to understand that Jesus grew up in an environment that provided him with a sufficient cultural base to subsequently amaze his countrymen with his knowledge of the scriptures.

Jesus must have known priests already in Nazareth, and Pharisees, who were very frequent everywhere, and Sadducees. Within these groups would be the wealthy stratum of the city, and they would live in the wealthy neighborhoods, in distinguished buildings of which unfortunately no remains have remained.

He must also have made contact with many foreigners from other parts of the world who offered him knowledge about the races and peoples of the Earth, and which would serve to launch his admonition to the apostles to go out and preach throughout the world, as That's how it went.

Perhaps future new finds will bring discoveries that will broaden our vision of Nazareth. In my opinion, the current city has erased many traces of the past, but it is possible that under the garages of many Nazarene houses there are remains that will reveal important data one day.

# Jesus' house in Nazareth

There is no way to find out where it was located and what the house in which Jesus lived was like. The Church of the Annunciation, located above other ancient churches, in Nazareth, is proclaimed to the visitor of the modern city as the church that marks the place of the house of Jesus, where Mary received the visit of the angel. However, an examination of what was found under the foundations of this church only raises serious doubts that Jesus really lived there. What exists is a kind of troglodytic cave, something common in Nazareth as a basement or cistern, but not as a dwelling.

According to _The Urantia Book_, the house of Jesus ([UB 122:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_9) and [UB 122:6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p6)) was located north of Nazareth, on the southeastern slope of the highest hill in the area, some distance from the city's fountain, although it had a nearby spring [UB 123:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_15), probably used by a potter whom The Book mentions in several sometimes a certain Nathan ([UB 123:5.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_15)). The house built by Joseph, the father of Jesus, was apparently located next to another in which a certain Jacob lived ([UB 123:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_9), [UB 124:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p2_4), [UB 126:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_1)), whose son, James, was a close friend of Jesus ([UB 123:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_4)), and later, his brother-in-law,

The house itself, which grew as the family expanded, ended up with three rooms, built with stone walls ([UB 124:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/124#p1_7)). Experts indicate, from the remains found in similar houses, that they used to be made of rough stone, stacked one on top of the other, joined by other smaller ones embedded in the interstices, and covered with a layer of clay, mud, or even mixed manure. with straw for better insulation. The floors were rammed earth. The roofs were made of straw, provided with wooden beams that supported the thick layer of straw or reeds, which served to protect the roof timbers from moisture and which in turn was covered with rammed mud for better insulation. The roof used to be used as a bedroom in the dry season.

One of the rooms was the dining room, another was the bedroom/workshop (bedroom by night and carpentry workshop by day), and the other was the manger for the animals. Behind the house, probably inside the corral or backyard, there was a construction without walls where the wheat mill and the oven were sheltered. The mill was large and needed the help of two people to use it, one to turn the wheel and the other to pour the grain into the hole. We are told that it was a very pleasant task for Jesus to use this mill (curiously, many parables of Jesus have to do with bread, wheat and yeast).

As furnishings, in the dining room there was a low stone table, clay pots, stone plates and pots, a loom, a small clay lamp, and several small benches.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/casa_nazaret.png"></figure>
<em> The House of Jesus in Nazareth </em>

In the workshop, at night, they lay on the floor on rugs (probably made of rope). The workshop would have the typical carpenter's bench, and the basic tools: an ax to cut down trees, an adze to roughen the wood, an axe, iron handsaws to cut the wood to size, a brace board and several drill bits to drill it, a stone-headed hammer for nailing, a wooden mallet for hitting chisels or adjusting planks; iron chisels and files for carving wood, awls for drilling wood or leather, and an assortment of nails for joining and reinforcing. It is also possible that there were planes or brushes. To measure, a ruler, a compass, chalk and of course some kind of pencils to trace the cuts. The room would be cluttered with wood, especially of sycamore or wild fig tree, of soft and porous wood, but resistant. Also olive, hard, fine-grained and amber-colored, or perhaps oak. In cases of special requests, cedar and Phoenician cypress, the most expensive, could be used.

Stored, the products of work: farming implements (carts, carts, threshers, plows, pitchforks, yokes and handles), construction elements (beams, posts, planks, doors and window frames) or furniture (tables, chairs, trunks and drawers).

As for the stable, the family once had a donkey, three cows (from whose milk they made cheese), chickens, four sheep, and a dog ([UB 126:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_11)). On the roof side of the manger, Mary had set up a dovecote ([UB 123:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p4_4)). It had an economic purpose. The pigeons were sold either for sacrifices in the temple or outside of it.

The courtyard was kept by Mary adorned with vines and flowers from Galilee on its walls ([UB 123:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_7)).

Above the rooms, up an unrailed stone staircase inside the courtyard ([UB 123:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p4_5)), were terraces where temporary canvas roofs were arranged in summer. People used to sleep on the roof in summer, sheltered by these awnings and balustrades, since the intense summer heat allowed it. The autumn rains caused frequent leaks in the roofs, which had to be repaired by means of stone rollers that pressed the ground and covered the cracks and hollows.

# Cana of Galilee

Oddly enough, there are still many biblical places whose exact location is unknown. Sometimes the site has not been discovered, but in others there is a multiplicity of hypotheses that make it equally difficult to decide on a location. This is the case of Cana in Galilee, the ancient city where, according to the Gospel of John, Jesus performed his first miracle, turning water into wine.

Many authors and scholars of the life of Jesus take only one location for Cana for granted, but the reality is that there is no unanimity among archaeologists and experts on the correct location.

Let's examine the four possible deposits that are being considered:

## Kanah

Location:

Located about eight miles southeast of ancient Tyre. There is currently a population called Qana.

Arguments in favor:

It is mentioned by Eusebius (_Onomastica Sacra_ 110, 3-6; 271, 50-53), and Jerome (Latin translation of the _Onomasticon_). Jerome also notes that there were two cities called Cana, one of them called “the great one.”

Counterarguments:

This Cana would be located at the time of Jesus in Phoenicia and not in Galilee, and it would be a very unlikely place for a Jewish wedding and for Jesus to begin his ministry there. Furthermore, it would not make much sense for Nathanael and Philip, the apostles, to be friends, since Philip was from Bethsaida (next to the Sea of ​​Galilee), as we are told in _Jn_ 1.

## 'Ain Kanah

Location:

Located about two kilometers northwest of Nazareth, where there is a source with this name on a road that goes from Reinah to Mount Tabor.

Arguments in favor:

This site was suggested by CR Condor in 1878 because the current name of 'Ain Kanah suggested a Greek translation of an ancient town called Cana.

Counterarguments:

There is no evidence either from tradition or from archaeology. No ruins have been found.

## Kefar Kenna

Location:

Located six kilometers northeast of Nazareth.

Arguments in favor:

It is the place that tradition has marked as the correct place, existing a Franciscan church on some ruins of deposits that are claimed as the vessels that contained the wine of the miracle.

On the other hand, according to D. Zeller (1869), it was located in an ideal position. Only about 200 houses currently exist on the site, but he estimated that it must have been three times the size of the city in the past, considering the existence of a good nearby spring and its location on a west-facing slope.

Zeller also claims that the Cana that Josephus mentions in his biography can only refer to this place, although the arguments he offers can also be applied to Khirbet Kana. Josephus narrated that they made a night march with Jewish soldiers from Cana to Tiberias. This march, of about 18 kilometers, could as well have been made from Kefar Kenna as from Khirbet Kana.

Lastly, the final argument in favor of Kefar Kenna is tradition. But it is a common mistake to consider that the tradition about this place goes back to the time of Jesus. Only in the 17th century did this place begin to be considered the most probable, although others, such as Kanah and Khirbet Kanah, were already known. Finally, the Franciscans acquired a piece of land on which they built a church

Counterarguments:

No archaeological remains have been found that can be traced back to the time of Jesus, although ruins from that time have been found at a site several kilometers away.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/cana_kafarkenna.png"></figure>
<em>Kefar Kenna in Google Earth</em>

## Khirbet Kanah

Location:

Located about twelve kilometers north of Nazareth. They are uninhabited ruins located on the slopes that border the Bet Netufa valley to the north, also known as the Battauf plain.

Arguments in favor:

This site was located in a strategic position, on an old road that surely connected ancient Tolemaida with Magdala, and on the route that connected Nazareth with Jotapata, an old stronghold of the Jewish resistance. This makes him seem more acceptable in the face of the stories of Flavius ​​Josephus. There is a mention of Josephus relating even Cana of Galilee to the plain of Asochis, which can be identified with the valley of Bet Netufa.

On the other hand, the great archaeologist Robinson was the first to point out that the Arabic name of the place (Kana el-Jelil) is a faithful translation of the Greek equivalent of Cana of Galilee.

Archaeological evidence has also been found at this site, indicating that it was inhabited in the Israelite, Roman and Arab periods.

<em>Khirbet Kana and Google Earth</em>

Counterarguments:

There do not seem to be any sources of water in this locality. But how can it be then that a population was established in this place? There is a logical explanation. Numerous cisterns were dug to collect rainwater, as was done in many other places in these lands.

Another counterargument is based on the idea that we are told in the Gospels that Jesus traveled along the Nazareth - Cana - Capernaum route, and Khirbet Kanah is not on the shortest route between these towns.

Another argument against it is the small size of the site which has been estimated to be no more than 50 houses, although these estimates are based on a few excavated ruins.

Finally, some scholars raise objections when considering the testimonies of various medieval pilgrims that speak of a church erected at Cana by Constantine's mother, Helen.

## A story in the press

A few months ago, a piece of news broke in the press, from which I have not been able to obtain much information, in which it was announced that a new discovery had been made in Kefar Kenna. In the references there are links to a website with the news.

The finding refers to some excavations that have been carried out since 1999 in the vicinity of Kefar Cana, which is already customary to call the “current Cana” (because it is the only site, removing the Phoenician Cana, that is currently inhabited ).

However, it is a bit surprising how little caution with which the archaeologists of this excavation have propagated their findings, affirming, by the simple fact of having found remains of stone vessels, that they have found the house even in which the wedding. Let us remember that the Gospel of John mentions with great precision that “six stone jars of about 80 to 100 liters each were used at the wedding” (Jn 2:6). Apparently archaeologists have unearthed remains of vessels of these dimensions.

But does this mean that we have discovered the house in question? These vessels, as many other excavations have shown, were a very common piece of furniture at the time of Jesus. Many more studies and calm excavations will be necessary to reach any conclusion about these new findings, but what is clear is that they represent an interesting added incentive to the controversy of what is the true location of Cana.

## What does _The Urantia Book_ say?

_The Urantia Book_ makes several mentions of Cana, but from none of them it is possible to decipher the position of the locality. We can only observe that Jesus travels from Capernaum to Cana with part of his family in a single day. However, this does not tell us much. Virtually all of the sites were within a day of Capernaum, although the one that is especially close is Khirbet Kana (see [UB 137:3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p3)).

Therefore, which one to opt for?

## Conclusions

In my opinion, and following the experts, the first two locations, Kana and 'Ain Kanah, do not have a solid basis to justify their choice. We are therefore left with two options: Kefar Kenna and Khirbet Kana.

Although many experts easily propose the choice of Kefar Kenna, after having examined the testimonies, collating plans and geographical references, and having accessed the web pages where the progress of the archaeological campaigns at both sites is shown, I personally prefer by Khirbet Kana, and this is how it is reflected in _Jesus of Nazareth_.

It should be noted that Kefar Kenna was at the time of Jesus situated on the road from Sepphoris to Tiberias. However, we know that Tiberias began to be built during the youth of Jesus, and that Sepphoris underwent a profound urban remodeling also at that time. All this was due to the building spirit of Herod Antipas, who first chose Sepphoris and then Tiberias as the capitals of his kingdom.

Therefore, it is logical to think that a Roman road was built between the two towns that would continue to the west, joining the Sea of ​​Galilee with the Mediterranean. But this causeway would be at most under construction at the time of Jesus, or just recently built. On the other hand, the passers-by on this road would undoubtedly be inhabitants of these two cities, Jews with relaxed customs and pagans, for the most part. It is easy to imagine that this road would not be a common route for the Jews of the time.

We also know that there was another road parallel to this one long before, a typical Jewish road that linked Ptolemaida with Capernaum and that ran through a pleasant valley. This makes it easier for me to imagine the Jews traveling this route and avoiding the pagan road that linked Sepphoris with Tiberias. It is natural to think that the ancient Cana of Galilee was located on this typical Jewish road.

From all this, coupled with the fact that remains from the time of Jesus have certainly been found in Khirbet Kana and have not been found so clearly in Kefar Kenna, my idea has arisen of choosing Khirbet Kana as the place where the famous wedding.

But, once it has been decided that Kefar Kenna is not the correct location, another question arises: what population then existed there near Nazareth at the time of Jesus? Obviously, more research is needed...

# Safed

Safed is one of the towns mentioned among those visited by the apostles in _The Urantia Book_ (doc. 18:9).

A good orthophoto is available on the Google maps map. We have information about the current city at http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safed but nothing about the old city. It was famous for being a very healthy area, with pleasant summers and harsh winters. Altitude: 900 meters, and high rainfall.

The city's website (www.safed.co.il) contains a lot of data.
It has and had great views, as it is located on top of the mountain of Upper Galilee. To the east the Golan (Gaulanitide), to the north Hermon and Lebanon, to the west Mount Meron and the Valley of Amud, and to the south Tiberias and the Sea of ​​Galilee.

There was a legend that the Messiah would come from Safed on his way to Jerusalem, although I am not sure if this legend existed in the time of Jesus or is more modern.

It appears mentioned in times of the second temple as Tzefiya and Flavio Josefo fortified it.

There are many caves in the surroundings, the most famous where Sem and Ever (the latter is totally unknown to me), son and great-great-grandfather of Noah, were supposed to have been.

# Giscala

Giscala also appears as one of the towns visited by the apostles.

This population was located in the current Al-Jish or Jish.

The name is the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew “Gush-halab”, which means “large piece of land”.

It was a city that produced a well-known fine oil, and that was produced in large quantities, so there must have been large mills, according to Josephus (_Autobiography_ 13; _War of the Jews_, II-21,2). It also produced fine raw silk.

The city was considered a very old fortress, before the destruction it suffered in the war against Rome in 70.

Meron is a city nearby that is mentioned in the scriptures. In Giscala there are some extraordinary ruins of an ancient synagogue, but from the 3rd or 4th century.

It was a well-known town long after Jesus because one of the Jewish leaders of the revolt against Rome, Juan de Giscala, was from there. Without a doubt, Jesus knew his parents, a certain Levi according to Josephus. Perhaps he was one of those who did not believe in Jesus from this town. However, this character does not appear in the novel. I don't like to force the story to bring in certain people just because we know they existed.

It was situated on a hill that falls steeply to the east.

Numerous caves and passageways have been found, northwest of the synagogue, forming like networks of passageways for defensive purposes and to counter sieges. They have also been found in many other towns in Galilee. On this aspect, I found this information in an issue of the Jewish publication “Milim Cultural”:

> Dozens of caves have been discovered in the Galilee in recent times. Most of them are under the courtyards of private houses in Arab villages. Many of them were found after the earthquakes, and others only after the villagers convinced themselves that they would not be harmed by the excavations.
> 
> After intensive research and careful searching of the entire area, accompanied by repeated reading of the writings of Josephus Flavius, a network of hidden passages was recently found at Giscala that can be considered to correspond to the period of the second temple.
> 
> Josephus made many brief references to the caves in which the Jews hid during the great rebellion. Describing the end of the battle at Jotapata, he wrote, “the Romans sought out where the Jews hid and killed the people who hid in tunnels and caves.” After the battle, he recounted how the Romans found hidden in a deep well, connected to much larger caves, invisible to anyone above them, forty people who hid there.
>
> A careful search determined the existence in Jeish of tunnels, some of them very long, and of caves, some of them very large. [http://www.milimcultural.com.ar/newsletter/milim025.htm]

#betabara

Betabara is a town that is mentioned in Jn 1:28 as a place where John baptized. There is no clear unanimity among scholars when it comes to placing this population and also Ainón. According to the Madaba map, a mosaic from the 6th century, Bethabara was located by the Jordan, near the mouth of the river in the Dead Sea, but on the eastern shore, while Ainon or Aenon would be located on the western shore. From the size of the letters on this map, moreover, it appears that Ainon was the important population, while Betabara was secondary. Scholars seem to debate whether or not the designations Bethany and Betabara should be assumed to correspond to the same place and whether this place near the Dead Sea was the correct one. However, in my opinion the whole discussion is wrong from before, for all the sources that speak of these places are very late, and the ancient writers who speak of them tend to change the denomination frequently. Thus, for example, apart from the place being sometimes referred to as Bethany only, sometimes as Bethany Beyond the Jordan, and sometimes as Betabara (although the name Betabara only appears that way because of Origen, who apparently used it to avoid confusion with the other Bethany near Jerusalem), the names of Sapsaphas, Salumias, Salin, Salem, Ainon, or Aenon are also used for this location, either on one shore or the other. The designation as Salem seems to be due to a tradition that places on a mound the famous place where Salem's king, Melchizedek, performed a sacrifice. From there they can also derive the denominations of Salumias and Salín. As for Ainón or Aenon, it is the Greek word for the Hebrew _ay-yin_, which means source or spring. It is very possible that on the eastern bank there was a famous spring that sometimes caused the name of Betania to be lost, preferring this other.

In _The Urantia Book_ it is mentioned only as Bethany Beyond the Jordan, and never with any of the other denominations. Furthermore, in _The Urantia Book_ 141:7.2 we are expressly told that Bethany was on the eastern bank, for it says that Jesus went to the hills “across the river, south of Jericho.” Therefore, I believe that at the time of Jesus this place was always known by the name of Bethany, and Beyond the Jordan was added because it was on the other side (transjordan) of the river, that is, on the eastern bank, and not where the Madaba map placed it later. In its vicinity, on one or the other shore, there must have been several venerated places, some by the Jews, such as the place called Salem or Salín, where Melchizedek supposedly made a gesture in honor of Abraham, the father of the Jewish faith, or the place where the prophet Elijah also lived, near the Chorath stream. Regarding the Christian faith, here it was believed that John the Baptist began to preach and baptize, and modern archeology has unearthed the remains of a church and a monastery in the area, from the Byzantine period, which testify to the belief that this was a site revered by pilgrims since ancient times.

<em>Map of Madaba at the mouth of the Jordan at the Dead Sea (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Sapsaphas_Madaba.jpg)</em>

The town must have been important, since it was an obligatory stop on the route to Jericho and Jerusalem along the eastern road that avoided Samaria. In the map of Madaba, the drawing of large fish in the river can be seen, so there must have been a certain fishing industry; of date palms, for whose fruits, dates, the region was famous; a lion chasing an antelope, which attests to a fairly wild fauna; and a ferry or boat that crossed the Jordan River pulled by a strong rope from both ends of the river, although at a height further north. I have doubts whether there was a traversable ford at the time of Jesus at any season of the year, or this means of the ferry was the only possible way to cross the river.

# Jericho

The city of Jericho was given by Marco Antonio to Cleopatra as a gift, but after the suicide of both, King Herod recovered its possession, given by the new emperor Augustus. The king used it extensively as his winter residence, building a hippodrome to entertain his guests, several aqueducts to irrigate the area under the nearby cliffs, and to supply his winter palace with water. It was in a pool in Jericho that Herod apparently gave the order to assassinate Aristobulus III. Under Archelaus, the ethnarch built nearby Arquelais, a small town-fortress where his date growers took refuge. The area was thickly dedicated to this crop in a wide strip of land. The population was located near the entrance to the _Wadi_ Qelt (known at that time as _nahal_ Perat), where Herod built a fortress called Kypros, in honor of his mother. During his long reign, from 37 to 4 B.C. C., Herod managed to build three independent palaces on the same site, which ultimately functioned as one. It seems that in the early years of Herod (37-31 BC), the Hasmonean family continued to use their palace at Jericho. The dramatic murder of Aristobulus III in a pool at Jericho, as told by Flavius ​​Josephus, took place during a banquet hosted by Herod's mother-in-law. the Hasmonean family continued to use their palace at Jericho.

The dramatic murder of Aristobulus III in a pool at Jericho, as told by Flavius ​​Josephus, took place during a banquet hosted by Herod's mother-in-law.

Herod built his independent palace first at Jericho (probably around 35 BC), not far from the Hasmonean, south of _Wadi_ Qelt. It was a large rectangular building (84x45 m), built on three sides of a peristyle courtyard. It included a large triclinium, various spaces and room service, a Roman-style bathhouse, and a ritual bath. Despite the free placement, which resembles a Roman house similar to those in Pompeii, this design may reflect the political insecurity of Herod (35-30 BC), when Jericho was taken from him and given to the queen of Egypt, Cleopatra .

Herod's second palace (around 25 BC), was built as an open complex, exposed to the surrounding landscape. It was built on top of the ruined Hasmonean complex, following the destruction of the latter by the 31 BC earthquake. The main wing of the palace (the E wing) was built to the NE of the ruined twin palaces. It is structured on two levels: the upper one with a swimming pool and utility rooms was built around a large peristyle courtyard, the lower one included the Hasmonean pool (20x12.5 m), a Roman-style bathhouse, and different utility rooms. .

In the west wing the two large Hasmonean pools were combined into one large pool (32x18 m), surrounded by newly planted gardens. Another wing (perhaps a villa) was built on top of the artificial Hasmonean hill, but no evidence of this has been found.

The largest and most sophisticated palace built by Herod in Jericho, the third palace, was built around 15 BC. C. on both sides of _Wadi_ Qelt, to the N of the first palace and to the SE of the second. Covering around 3 hectares, it was built following a network system parallel to the boulevard. Roman builders and craftsmen collaborated with local craftsmen using Roman concrete, which was covered by small stones in _opus reticulatum_ and _quadratum_, along with mud bricks.

The main wing of the palace was the north. They included several palatial rooms, two small peristyle garden courtyards, a relatively large Roman-style bathhouse, and a huge triclinium. This triclinium (29x19 m) had rows of columns on three of its sides, similar in plan to that of the first palace. Most of its floor was covered by an elaborate floor _opus sectile_ (its paintings were looted in antiquity). The walls, like virtually every other wall in this wing, were covered with frescoes. This unit also included two large colonnades, built along the promenade, facing the sunken garden. The walls of these colonnades, as well as those of other rooms, were decorated with stucco.

The other three large wings of the third palace were built south of _Wadi_ Qelt: the sunken garden, a huge pool, and a building.

The sunken garden, an elaborately shaped garden (140x40m), was flanked by two raised colonnades at the short ends. The south façade was decorated with 48 niches, with a water channel in front of them. The center of this facade was designed with a small semicircular garden, in the form of a theater. The large pool (90x42 m) was probably used for swimming, boating, and water games.

Only the foundations, a circle surrounded by a square, have survived of the building that once stood atop the artificial hill. There is good reason to infer that above these foundations there was a round reception room, 16 m in diameter, with four semicircular niches around it (a similar room, 8 m in diameter, was integrated into the Roman-style bathhouse). Roman of the N wing). After this reconstruction, this room was similar in shape to the contemporary Templo di Merkuri in Baia. This elevated room was reached by a stairway-bridge built on a series of arches. A second bridge, for which we have no evidence, was probably built across _Wadi_ Qelt, connecting the two parts of the palace.

The winter palace complex also included a number of structures built to the east of the Hasmonean palace. These structures (only partially excavated) were built along the fringe of the royal property, perhaps as a house for the administrative staff. On its eastern edge, a small “industrial zone” has been found, probably to process some of the royal goods (perhaps the _opobalsamum_).

Another important construction project of Herod was revealed and excavated by Netzer (1975/76) at Tell el Samarat, S of Tell el-Sultan. It is made up of the remains of a unique complex in the entire Greco-Roman world, which included a horse and chariot racing track, the cavea of ​​a 70-meter-wide theater, and a beautiful building (70x70 m) raised on top. of an artificial mound. Little has survived of the foundations of this building, which may have served as a reception area or gymnasium.

This combined construction project (fitted out for horse racing, athletics, boxing, theater, and musical performances, such as those held at the quinquennial games in honor of Augustus, which Herod established and maintained in Jerusalem and Caesarea), is probably what Josephus refers to mentioning in Jericho a hippodrome, a theater and an amphitheater.

Very few other Hasmonean or Herodian ruins are known at Jericho, however there are a few independent dwellings.

Jericho as a whole functioned not only as an agricultural center and crossroads, but as a winter resort for the Jerusalem aristocracy. However, since the work of Jesus and his apostles in Jericho was limited to the city and they avoided proximity to the ancient palaces of Herod, little or none of the available archaeological material has been of use to me for the novel.

# Jerusalem

Hebrew: _Jerusalem_

Jerusalem is the quintessential Jewish city. All the eyes and desires of any Jew, wherever he lived, were set on his longed-for holy city. Jerusalem was located at the time of Jesus in what was the Roman province of Judea, which first belonged to a king subject to Rome and then came to be ruled by a procurator. Jerusalem occupied a situation rather to the south with respect to the entire Jewish territory. Politically, the province of Judea and other Jewish provinces were subject to the authority of the governor of the province of Syria and depended on it.

## The weather

In Jerusalem, which is 740 m above sea level, the average annual temperature is 16 degrees. The average for January is around 10 and for August around 27. It practically never drops below zero, but it is not uncommon for it to exceed 40 in summer. It never snows. But rainfall is not usually rare, and is lavish in the months of January and February, and sporadically, the rest of the months except in summer. However, the Jews, much more than the heat or the cold, what concerned them was the wind. In spring, the _sherquijje_, a kind of sirocco or warm wind from the east, was frequent, as was the _khamsin_, although more common in summer, or simún of the desert, coming from the southeast. Both were especially dangerous for people, animals and crops.

## The current city and the city at the time of Jesus

The current city of Jerusalem, despite being one of the most important religious tourist centers on the planet, bears little relation to the physiognomy of the ancient city. Centuries of wars and sieges have erased the traces of the past until disfiguring the city that Jesus knew. Very few of the places that are offered to the visitor as the location of the outstanding events in the Master's life offer any degree of credibility, and its interest lies in the fact that it was in these places that a dubious tradition established the event. However, in this document we do not intend to enter the archaeological discussions about places venerated by believers, but only offer a perspective of what scholarly research has been able to verify. In a future study we will address the question of the veracity of these places.

## General description

The holy city was, like many important cities of the time, a walled city. The entire urban nucleus appeared to be surrounded by a wall that gave it an elongated appearance from north to south. The northern part had two walls, one inside the other: the _first north wall or viaduct_, which, starting from the west face of the temple, reached the north facade of Herod's palace and connected them both through the upper passage of the wall; and surrounding it, and covering a wide area to the north, the _second north wall_.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/400px-Jerusalen_siglo_primero.jpg"></figure>
<em>Reconstruction of the Jerusalem of the time of Jesus. On the right, the three towers of Herod; in the foreground, Herod's palace. In the background on the left, the temple. http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jerusalem_first_century.jpg</em>

The buildings were usually a ground floor with an upper terrace or uninhabitable attic, or two floors, for the wealthiest Jews. Among these houses stood out, imposing, two constructions of spectacular size: one was the great enclosure of the _temple_ (religious and spiritual center) with the _Fortress Antonia_, and another the _palace of Herod the Great_ (government center). The entire city was crossed, from north to south, by a depression or channel called the _valley of Tyropeon_ (in Hebrew _hagai_). On both sides the population settled on several mounds. The eastern mounds were _Mount Moria_, to the northeast, on which the Antonia temple and fortress stood, and _Mount Ophel_, at the extreme southeast of the city, and which in ancient times was where the City of David or Jebus.

Rodeando la ciudad santa se disponían varias torrenteras o cauces. Entre la muralla este y el _monte de los Olivos_ (llamado en griego Eleona y en romano Olivete) estaba el llamado _cauce del Cedrón_, que discurría por el el _valle de Josafat_, y al sur y oeste, el _valle Hinnon o de la Gehenna_, en cuya vertiente sur se hallaba ubicado el basurero de la población.

The buildings, limited by these enclosed valleys, had had to extend to the north, the only possible direction. At the time of Jesus, this part of the city was relatively new, with wealthy new neighborhoods and many orchards. At that time, the construction of a wall that would surround that area, the _third north wall_, and which he built several decades later, had not begun. To the north was another high mountain, _Mount Scopus_ (named after the Greek word _skopein_ = observation, lookout).

## The doors

To cross the walled enclosure there were a few gates or doors, which crossed the wall. In the northern zone there were four: the _door of the Sheep_, which went directly through the wall of the temple and communicated with the area of ​​the Patio de los Gentiles, where the cattle and the products for the sacrifices were sold and the money changers had their market ; the _door of the Fishes_, so called because the pagan (Phoenician) merchants who brought the fish used to set up their stalls there; the _gate of the Gardens_, which led to the orchards located in the new city; and the _old door_, very close to the previous one, and through which the new quarter of the city was accessed.

In the western part there were two accesses: the _Ephraim gate_, near the famous rock of Golgotha, and the _Lydda gate_, located near an access through which the first north wall or viaduct could be crossed.

The southern area had three gates: the _de la Basura_, the _de los Esenios_, and the _de la Fuente_, the latter so called because it was in the direction of En-Roguel, where there was a spring.

On the east face there were four gates: the _de las Aguas_, the _de los Caballos_, the _Oriental_, and the _de los Jueces_. The last three were rarely used to enter the city because they forced the walker to climb some steep slopes that formed the dry bed of the Cedrón.

## The temple

The immense temple precinct was in the shape of a rectangle somewhat longer on its north face than on its south face. He alone occupied more than a fifth of the city's surface. It appeared closed by robust walls about 50 m high. Its north face, known as the _Atrio de los Gentiles_, and whose westernmost end was attached to the _Torre Antonia_, was about 300 m long. Facing the Mount of Olives, the east façade, all of it in white marble (or according to other scholars stone with stucco that gave the sensation of marble), forming what was called the _Solomon's Court_, covered a distance of more than 400 m . The western wall was practically of the same dimensions, while the southern face was a little over 250 m, and there was another covered space, the _Atrio Regio_, _Stoa Real_ or _Basílica_. this porch, Highly spectacular, it had its own entrance from the west, comprising a staircase and a bridge supported by a sturdy construction (today called the Robinson Arch, and at that time probably the Basilica Arch). Civil and non-religious affairs of the temple were settled in this atrium. That's why he had his direct entrance through the arch.

The entire inner esplanade of the enclosure and that was not inside the sacred space of the _Sanctuary_ formed the well-known _Patio de los Gentiles_, or _Esplanade of the Gentiles_. Only there were foreigners allowed. In the center of the esplanade stood the Sanctuary, imposing. To delimit this space, it was being built in the time of Jesus, since its construction had not yet been completed, a low wall around it about a meter high, called soreg or jel. All pagans were forbidden to cross this fence under construction under penalty of death. One of the stone inscriptions has been found, which with chiseled Greek letters decorated in red, to highlight it more, warned pilgrims of this: “No foreigner will pass this balustrade or enter this enclosure that surrounds the temple. Whoever is caught doing so must blame himself for his death, which will be executed immediately.' This low wall was being arranged with eleven access doors, four on the north face, three on the east, and another four on the south. The west face was devoid of entrances and had only the rear façade of the immense sacred building.

For the entrance to the temple there were doors in all the walls. In the south, the _Huldah gates_ are particularly famous, named after the biblical prophetess, and there were two of them: the _Double gate_, with two bays, used to exit, and the _Triple gate_, with three bays, used to enter . These doors, through passageways under the Basilica that were decorated with geometric drawings, with rosettes reminiscent of chrysanthemums, ranunculus and other flowers of the area, and with drawings of vines and bunches of grapes, led directly to the Esplanade of the temple up some stairs. They were the entrances that pilgrims and the common people used to use. Next to the entrance of the two doors of Hulda there were some _miqwaoth_ or public baths that the pilgrims had to use to purify themselves.

<em>Reconstruction of the temple at the time of Jesus. The royal portico can be seen on the left, the Sanctuary in the middle, and the court of the Gentiles and the Antonia fortress on the right. http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Jerusalem_Modell_BW_2.JPG</em>

In the west, we have already talked about the _door of the arch of the Basilica_, through which the Royal Atrium was entered directly (and in this way the religious and civil part of the temple were separated by different entrances). This arch, which was the largest in the world at that time, to give us an idea of ​​its enormity, weighed 1000 tons, and on top of it ran a bridge about 15 m wide (like a 4-lane highway). Also in the west wall there were three other accesses apart from the door of the Basilica. The most important is the one that entered the western atrium directly through the first northern wall or viaduct at its junction with the temple, and which for lack of another name I would call the _Royal gate_ (Josephus simply calls it the “great gate”, and indeed it must have been the largest). This access was used by the Herodian royalty and the wealthy inhabitants of the upper city. Josephus tells us of an event, dated shortly before Herod's death, which scholars believe refers to this gate. Apparently Herod, to honor Rome, had a huge golden eagle hang over the jamb of this great door, which provoked the indignation of the Pharisees. A couple of them lowered themselves with ropes and destroyed the eagle, which cost them their execution. Solomon's Atrium was also accessed by two other accesses, located a few meters above street level, and which were ascended by steps attached to the walls of the wall. These two accesses, located on both sides and equidistant from the royal gate, would ascend to the Court of the Gentiles by ramps as did the gates of Hulda.

To the north, the only access was the _Sheep Gate_, through which cattle entered for sacrifices and for sale (remember that the stalls were to the north next to the Court of the Gentiles).

To the east, the gates of the east wall of the city, allowed direct access to Solomon's Court.

We must keep in mind that Herod, in building the temple, had the extension of the temple extended beyond what Mount Moriah would allow. To do this, during its construction high retaining walls were erected surrounding the enclosure. Then inside it was filled with earth, and to avoid high pressure against the walls, several floors of vaulted rooms were left, supported by Roman columns and arches 5 meters apart, paving the resulting upper surface, called _podium_. Above it were then settled the Atriums, the Esplanade of the Gentiles, and the temple itself. For this reason, the subsoil of the temple esplanade was full of enormous passageways, with vaulted domes, large chambers, warehouses, conduits for pipes, water tanks for ablutions and others.

The most impressive feature of the Temple Mount is its vastness. Including the adjacent esplanades, it was the largest sacred complex in the ancient world. The question is what could prompt Herod to undertake this great work. The answer is related to the nature of the temple's activities. While other peoples worshiped their gods in a multitude of temples, the Jews served one God in one temple and congregated massively on the occasion of the three pilgrimage festivals: _Sucot_ (of Tabernacles), _Shavuot_ (Pentecost), and before all, _Pesach_ (Passover). On these dates, multitudes of Jews from all over the country and from all over the world ascended to Jerusalem. The vast esplanade was necessary to accommodate both visitors and the city's own inhabitants during sacred ceremonies. To this we must add Herod's fondness for large companies that led him to start countless works of disproportionate proportions.

As we have said, at that time the works were not finished. (“It took forty-six years to build this temple, and will you raise it up in three days?”, the Jews say to Jesus around the year 30). Herod had begun the new constructions in the year 19-20 before our era, and they were not definitively finished until the year 62-64 AD, in the time of Governor Albino. However, at the time of Jesus, the most important part of the work was already finished. Herod's innovations were these: elevation of the 30 meters of the ancient Sanctuary to 60 meters (a current building of about 20 floors!); construction of a great gate between the court of the women and that of the Israelites; expansion of the outer court to the north and south by means of gigantic foundations; construction of porticoes around the esplanade of the temple. As soon as these works were finished, and before the Jewish insurrection of 1966, new works were resumed. However, from when it was considered completely finished until it was demolished and destroyed by Roman troops, it took only three to four years.

During the festive days of the Jewish people, the patio or Esplanade of the Gentiles presented an unusual movement. Much of the northern area near the Court of the Gentiles was packed with stalls, tables, vendor stalls, and animal cages. This market was due to the sale of the obligatory animals and products necessary for religious rituals. There, pigeons, lambs, kids and even oxen were sold. In many of the stalls, which were nothing more than simple wooden boards mounted on the cages themselves or, at most, provided with legs or folding supports, the ritual products were offered and shouted to the public: oil, wine, salt, herbs bitters (mint, dill, cumin), walnuts, toasted almonds and even jam.

The sacred precinct of the _Sanctuary_ itself occupied a new, smaller rectangle inside the courtyard, slightly displaced to the north and close to the Antonia fortress. Its measurements were about 200 m by 140 m. It was surrounded by lower walls than those of the enclosure, with atriums and guarded at its corners by turrets. Dividing it into two halves was a fifth wall with an atrium and a wide gate with a semicircular entrance, the famous _Nicanor gate_. One of the halves was the so-called _Courtyard of the women_, who could not attend the ritual services except from a distance, and the other the _Courtyard of the priests_, intended for the men and the staff of the temple. In the latter is where the _Altar_ and the magnificent _Santuario_ were located, of a considerable height, about 60 m, and where the Jews believed that the presence of God was found. It was the sacred place par excellence, and no one, except the priests, could have access to it.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/800px-P8170082.JPG"></figure>
<em>Reconstruction of the sanctuary of the temple at the time of Jesus. The Nicanor gate can be seen in the center, which was accessed by steps, and which separated the courtyard of the women from that of the priests. http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:P8170082.JPG</em>

The temple, built by Herod the Great, had been erected with all the grandeur and luxury of the time. The construction of the walls had been executed based on rows of enormous stone ashlars, meticulously framed and fitted. At a certain height of the street, a row of stones called the Master Row had been arranged on the walls, with stones that reached up to 12 meters long, 3 meters high and it is estimated that 4.5 meters thick, exceeding the five hundred tons. The courses above and below the Course Master did not generally have such large ashlars, with an average height of 1.2 meters. The objective of the Master Course was to give greater stability to the rest of the courses. All the stones of the facade had the classic Herodian pillow decoration, with a raised trim on the edge that was sure to offer curious effects in the sunlight. The same effect must have been produced by the cup-shaped projections, which were used to hoist the stones with cranes, and which were normally removed once the stones were placed, but which in many cases had been left here. Another curious fact is that each row was displaced inwards by about 2.5 cm, about two fingers, creating a pyramid effect that prevented seeing the walls from the street as if they were coming at us.

The Court of the Gentiles had been surrounded by a superb colonnade. In the Portico Regio, as we have already said, up to 162 slender Corinthian-style pilasters could be counted, of such a width that it required three men with their arms outstretched to cover them. All these porticoes or atriums were covered with coffered ceilings made of cedar wood from Lebanon.

Upon entering the Sanctuary, wherever one came from, the gold dazzled everywhere. Gates covered with gold and silver had to be passed. The only exception was Nicanor's gate, which was Corinthian bronze, but gleamed like gold.

Once inside, in the women's court there were golden candlesticks, with four golden cups on their tops, and the temple treasuries, where donations and taxes were collected, were crammed with gold and silver objects.

The facade of the Sanctuary, about 28 m^2^ (100 square cubits) was covered with gold plates; so were the wall and the door between the hall and the Holy. The hall of the Sanctuary was entirely covered with gold plates the thickness of a denarius and 100 square cubits. On the roof there were sharp points of gold to scare away birds. Gold chains hung from the beams of the hall. Right there were two tables, one marble and one solid gold. Over the entrance that led from the vestibule to the Holy there was a vine also made of gold, which grew constantly with the donations of golden branches that the priests were in charge of hanging. In addition, a golden mirror hung above this entrance, reflecting the rays of the rising sun through the front door (which had no leaves). It had been a donation from Queen Helen of Adiabene. There were also other offerings in this hall. Emperor Augustus and his wife had once given away some bronze vases and other gifts, and his son-in-law Marcus Agrippa had also given gifts.

In the _Holy_, located behind the vestibule, there were unique works of art: the solid candelabra with seven arms weighing two talents (70 kg) and the solid table of showbread, also weighing several talents. The _sanctasanctorum_ must have been empty and its walls completely covered with gold.

Rabbinical treatises tell us about ten degrees of holiness on earth, and that they were located in concentric circles around the _sancta-sanctorum_: 1) the country of Israel; 2) the city of Jerusalem; 3) the temple mount; 4) the _soreg_ or _jel_, terrace with a balustrade that separated it from the rest of the esplanade of the temple, and that marked the limits allowed to the pagans; 5) the court of women; 6) the court of the Israelites; 7) the court of the priests; 8) the space between the altar of burnt offering and the temple building; 9) the temple building; 10) the _sancta-sanctorum_.

According to this division, what constitutes the so-called “inner court” comprises circles of holiness 6 and 7: the court of the Israelites and that of the priests. The other three innermost circles, 8, 9 and 10, also belonged to the inner court, but in no case were they accessible to the laity. In contrast, the space behind and on each side of the building did not belong to the space that was absolutely forbidden to them. The measurements of these circles, 6 to 10, have been indicated in the included drawing.

The width of the _jel_ was 10 cubits (1 cubit = 525 mm). The inner court, however, was not directly attached to the terrace, but, between them, there were side buildings where the doors were arranged to go from the inner court to the jel. These gate buildings had an exedra or vestibule (30 cubits wide) with seats and a room above it. But, between the _khel_ and the inner court were not only the gate buildings, but there were other side buildings that joined these gate buildings. On the north and south sides of the inner court were the treasure chambers and six rooms were used for cultic or similar purposes. Between the women's court and the _jel_ there were also door buildings and other constructions. In particular, four rooms of 40 square cubits located in the four corners of the court of the women. Here it was necessary to add to these rooms those adjacent to the Nicanor gate and the 15 steps that led to it from the women's atrium.

## The Antonia Fortress

Fortification attached to the northwestern end of the temple enclosure, built by Herod the Great when he rebuilt the old Maccabees fortress called _Baris_ and which he renamed Antonia in honor of Marco Antonio, his benefactor. It is debated among scholars whether the procurator had his residence there when religious festivals were celebrated, or whether he lived in Herod's Palace, in the western part of the city. What is clear, from the testimonies that have come down to us, is that it is very likely that there was a Roman garrison in both buildings.

The appearance and layout of this building is a pure speculation as there is no trace of its ruins. It was completely demolished during the siege of the city in the Jewish war of the 1st century. Today only the rock base on which it stood can be seen on some rocky outcrops to the north of the esplanade of the current mosques. Therefore, the scheme that I offer here must be taken with certain reservations and is based on the descriptions found in the books of various specialists.

Surrounding the castle there was a stone wall one and a half meters high, and after about ten to fifteen meters of wasteland it had a deep moat of about 22 m. This moat, dry at the time, surrounded the entire perimeter of the Roman procurator's residence, with the exception of the south face, which was attached to the temple. The foundations of this bastion were a gigantic rock, completely smoothed on its top and sides. Herod, in anticipation of possible attacks, had covered the sides with huge iron plates, so that access by them would be impracticable. And on this solid base stood the fort, built with huge rectangular stones.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/448px-P8170045.JPG"></figure>
<em> The Antonia Fortress. http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archivo:P8170045.JPG </em>

The moat was crossed by a drawbridge about 5 m long, based on thick logs on which a thick metal cover had been fixed. Near the moat, and inside it, attached to the fort, was the so-called Strution pool, a pool that had been collecting rainwater since the time of the Hasmoneans, and which has currently been located under an old pavement from the time of Hadrian. . It is unknown if it fed from sources other than rain, and what conduits flowed into it. But what is certain is that it was used as a water supply by the inhabitants of the fortress.

There is no complete consensus, but it is believed that the four corners of the castle had been reinforced by as many towers, equally fortified. Three of them were 50 cubits (22 m) and the fourth, the one that was attached to the temple, 70 cubits (32 m). However, there are scholars who, after carefully reading Flavio Josefo, come to the conclusion that there was only one large tower.

The gray stone facade, 40 cubits high (18 m), was crowned by a perfectly crenelated walkway, and was about 100 m long, featuring three rows of windows (those on the first floor were embrasures). In the lower part of the façade and in its center, a long staircase with two curved side ramps led up to a kind of terrace or viewpoint through which the entrance tunnel, located about 5 meters high, was accessed. This north entrance is sometimes not drawn in the recreations that I have found of the fortress, but it seems to me that it must have been an essential entrance to allow access for the cavalry and the procurator. This staircase and the upper viewpoint, moreover, would be the perfect place where the public trial of Jesus could have taken place,

Entering through the interior of the vaulted tunnel that served as the entrance at the north end, it communicated with an open-air quadrangular patio of about 50 m on a side and paved with hard limestone slabs of 1m2 each. An endless number of doors, crowned by wooden lintels forming semicircular arches, lined the sides, under as many porticoes supported by colonnades. The bedrooms, the stables, and some storerooms led into that large courtyard. In the center of it was a column with rings and a small circular pond, which was used to hold and clean the horses.

A white marble staircase that started from a corner of the patio led to the upper floors. On the ground floor of the fortress the troops were housed, and the stables and warehouses were arranged. The prefect, the tribune in charge of the garrison and the officers had their residence and private rooms on the second floor. On the third floor and above, the arsenal was kept, the rooms for administrative tasks were found and the part of the troops that was in charge of surveillance from the battlements were housed. In one of these rooms, moreover, an important Jewish treasure was kept: the vestments of the high priest, which were only given to him on the occasion of the main festivals.

To access the fortress, apart from the entrance passageway under the north façade, there was a drawbridge attached to the west wall of the temple, which accessed through an inclined passageway at the base of the southwestern tower. There were also two large, sturdy gates, large enough for a man on horseback to pass through, located on the south side, the one that faced the Gentile esplanade of the temple. Through these two gates, located inside the so-called Atrium of the Gentiles, is where the troops accessed the esplanade of the temple to carry out their tasks of surveillance and control of the huge population of pilgrims who filled the holy precinct, especially during the festivities. .

## Other constructions

In the time of Jesus, the great builder king was Herod the Great (37-4 BC), and he left a mark of his builder zeal throughout the Jewish geography, and mostly in Jerusalem. Here we give a list of the buildings that he made under his reign:

* Restoration of the old temple until leaving it as we all know it. It was his star work. It was therefore called the temple of Herod. We have talked extensively about it before.
* To the north of the temple, dominating it, the Antonia tower was built, located in the same place where the temple fortress called _Bîrah_ or _Barîs_ had previously stood. We have also talked extensively about it before.
* Construction of the _Herod's Palace_, near the western wall, next to the western gate leading to Lydda.
* Construction, in the same place, of the _three towers of Herod_: _Hippicus_, _Phasael_ (the highest, 75 m, imitating the lighthouse of Alexandria, but half its size) and _Mariamme_.
* The magnificent _sepulchre_ that Herod had built during his lifetime, but which was not used, since the king was buried in the Herodium.
* The _theater_ built by Herod in Jerusalem.
* The _hippodrome_ built by Herod in Jerusalem. He was in the upper part of the city.
* Construction of an _aqueduct_ (see the route on the map).
* _Monument_ over the entrance to the tomb of David.

Regarding other constructions that were not the work of Herod:

* As for the _gymnasium_ or _palaistra_, it was a place of exercise built in times of Greek domination. It was not built by Herod. It is unlikely that it still existed at the time of Jesus.
* Neither was the _Palace of the Hasmoneans_ or Maccabees built by Herod, whose name clearly indicates to which period it belongs. This building was located in the extreme west, occupying the upper part of the city, to the west of the temple and above the Xisto or Market. This was the palace occupied by Herod Antipas, Philip and the rest of the Herodian royal family during their visits to the city.
* The princes of Adiabene, a kingdom located on the borders of the Roman and Parthian Empires (in present-day Iraq), after embracing Judaism and moving to Jerusalem, had other large buildings built around the time Jesus was crucified. Therefore, during the life of Jesus, these palaces surely remained under construction. A _king Monobazo's palace_ would be under construction, located in the southern part of the eastern hill. Also a _palace of Queen Helena of Adiabene_. This palace would be located in the center of the Akra; also, therefore, on the eastern hill. As for the exact location of the _palace of Princess Grapte of Adiabene_ it is uncertain, although it is certain that it would not be far from the temple, perhaps on the eastern hill as well. Queen Helena was built, three furlongs north of Jerusalem, a tomb in the form of a triple pyramid, where she was buried around 50 AD. It had some spectacular columns and its magnificence equaled that of the Halicarnassus mausoleum.

Among the great works of construction, we finally have to mention the _aqueduct built by Pontius Pilate_. To build it he took the money from the temple and that work provoked a popular revolt, which had to be suffocated with the soldiers' clubs. It made the same route as the one built by Herod, but in a shorter and safer way. The materials with which it was built were lead and mortar.
One last building: on Mount Ophel there was a _synagogue_ with a hostel for outsiders and a _bath facility_.

## Artistic constructions

The aforementioned constructions are, for the most part, sumptuous buildings; the artistic trades found in them a wide field of work. Especially Herod's palace was rich in unique works of art. The most diverse artisans had rivaled each other in both exterior and interior decoration, both in the choice of materials and in their application, both in variety and in the luxury of details. Sculptors, weavers artists, installers of gardens and suppliers, silversmiths and goldsmiths took part.

The main artistic works are the tombs called _tombs of the kings_ and the three funerary monuments of the Cedrón valley, today known as the tombs of Absalom, Santiago and Zechariah (or _monuments of the prophets_).

The tombs of the kings are the pantheon of Helena de Adiabene, in front of Helena's tomb, in the three pyramids that her mother had ordered to be built three stadia from the city. Today a cornice with garlands of fruit and foliage in the form of scrolls is in fairly good condition. In front of the entrance that leads to the funerary installation lie remains of columns, among which are Corinthian capitals. This construction surely did not exist during Jesus' lifetime, since Queen Helena moved to Jerusalem around the year 30 AD and died in 50 AD In Absalom's tomb, Doric and Ionic capitals, semi-columns and pilasters are preserved. And immediately above the capitals is a decorated frieze; the architrave is Doric. In the tomb of Santiago there are columns with Doric capitals, and above it a Doric frieze with triglyphs.

## Current constructions

The subsoil of Jerusalem was almost hollow. The royal caverns long served as quarries. These famous caverns or caves still exist, such as the so-called “cotton cave”. These caves extended for hundreds of meters. A particularly large and deserted cavern was the _Cavern of Zedekiah_. It was about twelve miles long (probably Egyptian miles), that is, about 19 km. Beneath the temple hill and the courts was a cavern. The underpasses of the city were also a very common work and of a great use in times of war; many inhabitants hid there.

Fountains, wells and any other excavation of caves, as well as ovens and places for smoke outlets, were also very common.

There were several canals in the city. Water always needed, in a place so arid in summer, cisterns to store and wells. There was a canal that ran from the outer court to the Kidron Valley.

To the south, between the Hippicus tower and the Essenes' Gate, was a place called Besou or Bethso, “garbage place.” It was the place where the rubbish was dumped. Near the Hinnon Valley was also the so-called Garbage Gate. This is because the Hinnom valley was discredited since ancient times, as it was related to the ancient cult of Molok. This valley passes through a place called Gehenna, from where it took the meaning of cursed place, or hell, which was later given to it.

Sewers also existed in Jerusalem, and some of these facilities were fully up to modern standards. They had an internal height of 1.78 to 2.36 m, and width, between 0.76 and 0.91 m. They seem to have been provided with holes to receive water from the street, as well as cleaning registers.

## The city

At that time, Jerusalem was divided into two large nuclei, separated by the Tyropean depression or valley: the upper area or _sûq-ha-elyon_, located to the west, and the lower area or _sûq-ha-tajton_ or _akra_. The fundamental characteristic of both areas, and hence their name (_sûq_ = bazaar), is that in both the bazaars or stalls of the different groups of artisans were available. Each of the sectors of the city was crossed by two main streets, adorned with colonnades: the great street of the market, in the upper area (the current sûq Bâb el-'Amud or Damascus Gate Bazaar); and the small street of the market, in the low or old city, and that more or less followed the bottom of the Tyropeón valley (current el-Wâd street). The second northern wall enclosed the northern part of the Akra neighborhood to the north, beyond the southeastern hill, Ophel. Due to the extension of the temple, the Tyropeón valley constituted the only link between the northern quarter and the southern quarter of the Akra.

These two commercial arteries were linked by a swarm of transversal streets that constituted a veritable labyrinth. In that network of alleys, most of them unpaved and immersed in a pestilent smell, a mixture of burnt oil, stews and urine thrown into the center of the road, thousands of houses were crowded, almost all of them with a single floor and with peeling walls. All the streets came from the east and west and crossed the valley of Tyropeón. The most important of these transversals was the street that went from Herod's palace to the temple, reaching it at the Xisto bridge (the current tarîq Bâb es-Silsileh, one of the main commercial bazaars today). This street ran parallel under the shadow of the huge viaduct that formed the first north wall,

The two main streets finally led to a much wider one or Calle de la Piscina, because it led to the famous pool of Siloé or del Enviado, at the southern end of the city, next to the great Antigua pool and the Portón de la Fuente. These pools were fed by a fountain, the Guijón fountain, which, from a spring next to the wall, crossed the wall through the so-called Hezekiah Tunnel.

The swarm of artisans and merchants from both areas had provoked a clear rivalry between the two sectors in the city, reaching unsuspected extremes. It turns out that while in the lower or ancient city the noblest and most considered professions had settled, in the upper city the pagan artisans, the proselytes, and above all, the community of fullers or fabric whiteners dominated, which because of their unpleasant profession, they had been despised.

It is these professions and places that we place below in the following list:

* In the new city: in the alley of the wool carders was the bazaar or market of the wool sellers (sûq sel sammarîm); to the north there must have been fullers in the new city, for in the northeast corner of the northernmost wall there was a monument to the fullers, and also a clothing market; in the northern suburb would be the cutidores' workshop; finally, outside the city walls, to the north, would be the blacksmiths' bazaar.
* In the upper city we have to the north the most important neighborhood of the fullers (all of them pagans) and the artisans of artistic objects.
* Finally, in the lower city, near the Garbage Gate, the weavers' quarter.

As we can see, most of the despised trades were located in remote places. The weavers were close to the Garbage Gate, which was a despised neighborhood. The tailors, in addition, used to be located next to the gates of the cities, since their profession was not very well seen. Because the pagan fullers were located in the upper city, the sputum in the street of one of these fullers was considered impure, which means that people concerned about their ritual purity never frequented this area of ​​the city. The merchants of Tire (pagans) who brought the fish to the city were located at the Gate of the Fishes. This area, the northern part of the new city, was a frequent place for pagan artisans and merchants and was an area little frequented by ritualistic Jews. The tanners, according to a law,

Other guilds whose location is unknown are the following: the bazaar of the bakers (think that a bazaar of the bakers was strange because in those days the bread used to be made in the houses, and surely it had to do with the sacrifices of loaves in the temple); the street of the butchers; a fattened poultry market; and others.

In the transit areas such as the gates and the proximities of the walls there was also another group of very numerous people in those days in the cities: the beggars. There were different groups with similar conditions (lame, crippled, lepers, blind...).

The surroundings of Jerusalem were rich in olive groves. Olive trees ranked first among the trees and plants in the city and its surroundings. The soil was very suitable for growing this tree. In fact, in the time of Jesus the olive groves were much more widespread than today. Various names of the city are composed with “oil”, “olives” and “olive trees”. To the east of the city is the Mount of Olives (also called Mount of Olives, Mountain of Olives, or Olivete; in Hebrew _tûr zêta_). Here the plantations were of a special importance and number. It is also known that there were olive groves to the south of the city, in the Hinnón valley. There were numerous wineries on the outskirts of the city, everywhere.

To the north there were many orchards, with their fences and fences. The entire northern part had long been full of gardens (or more exactly, orchards). That is why there was a gate in the city called Gennath, Gate of the Gardens, and which was located in the first northern wall.

Barely two kilometers east of the city was the village of Betania. Between Jerusalem and Bethany there were numerous trees. Betfagé, the village near Betania, has a name that translated means “house of green figs”, which indicates the importance of the fig plantations in that area. To the southeast, the lower reaches of the Cedrón Valley were especially suitable for the cultivation of orchards. Certainly, the Cedrón valley was a _wadi_ that only had water in winter, as it still does today. However, it received a peculiar risk. A channel supplied the blood of the victims sacrificed in the temple and was led to these orchards, also serving as excellent fertilizer.

On the western hill of the Kidron Valley, south of the temple esplanade, the vine was undoubtedly cultivated. Further south, below the Pool of Siloam, the orchards of the Kidron Valley received the waters of the Siloam Spring (actually, the spring was born further north, at the Gihon Spring). At the confluence of the Cedrón and Hinnón valleys, the royal gardens were located, from very old, in which a fountain was born: En-Rogel. In these gardens were the royal presses.

Southwest of the city, a village called _Erebinthon oikos_ alludes to the cultivation of chickpeas.

## Economic, political and religious importance of the city

a) Economic importance

A part of the Jewish territory was flat, in the region of Samaria and on the border with Idumea; while the other, the one in the center, was mountainous; For this reason, the land had to be cultivated with constant care so that the inhabitants of the mountains would also obtain an abundant harvest. The city of Jerusalem, therefore, needed to import food. The city not only had to feed its population, but also the crowds of pilgrims who flooded the city three times a year for the festivals. Compared to such needs, the firstfruits weighed nothing in the balance of Jerusalem's supply. In addition, it is not well known to what extent they were delivered, apart from the fact that they were the property of the priests, and as for other tributes in kind, they could be paid in the place where they lived.

The situation was further aggravated by this circumstance: the surroundings were notoriously unsuitable for growing wheat, and lacked cattle. Ordinarily, the city could supply its food needs in Palestine. Only in times of scarcity, or after wars, did it depend on trade with distant countries.

The city, due to its situation, was not only in need of essential products, but also lacked vitally needed resources: raw materials and, above all, metals. Consequently, it also had to import the raw materials, partly from Palestine and partly from distant countries.

Among the agricultural products (wheat, oil, and wine) of the province of Syria, including Palestine, only wine seems to have been exported in large quantities. Regarding Jerusalem in particular, the export of wheat could not be thought of. Nor was there a product made in Jerusalem that was characteristic of the city's crafts. However, oil was at the forefront of products from Judea or from around the city. In addition, the demand for oil in northern Syria was sometimes so great that its price was very high there. At Giscala, north of Galilee, 20 sextaries of oil cost no more than 1 drachma; On the other hand, in Caesarea Philippi, located at the foot of Hermon, about 30 km away, the price of 2 sextaries was 1 drachma, that is, ten times more. Therefore,

b) Political importance

Jerusalem was the center of Jewish political life. The great attraction it exerted on foreigners is explained by these three facts: it was the ancient capital, the seat of the supreme assembly and the goal of festive pilgrimages.

Jerusalem was the ancient capital. Herod's court was a great attraction for outsiders. The Hellenistic spirit fully reigned, with beast fights, gymnastic games, shows, chariot races at the hippodrome and theatrical performances. Foreigners participating, actively or passively, in sports competitions, writers and other characters of Hellenistic culture were the guests of Herod's court. Added to this were the numerous official relations maintained by Herod; because of these foreign envoys, messengers and guards came to Jerusalem.

Jerusalem was also the seat of the supreme assembly. The Sanhedrin held its sessions there, which, by its origin and nature, was the highest authority in the country and whose jurisdiction extended to all the Jews of the world. So it was at least theoretically; his supreme prestige guaranteed him to be heard by all Jews, although he could hardly use coercive means outside of Judea. Since Judea was converted in the year 6 AD. C. in the Roman province the Sanhedrin was its first political representation. A commission of the Sanhedrin constituted the financial assembly of the eleven Jewish toparchies, districts into which the Romans had divided the country. At that time, the Sanhedrin was also the first instance of the province in municipal affairs. Finally,

The Sanhedrin, because of its importance, maintained relations with Jews throughout the world through its synagogues and, within Judea, linked Jerusalem administratively with the smallest of villages.

The three pilgrimage festivals were celebrated in the temple. The caravans that flocked to them, due to the political importance of the festive gatherings, greatly increased the years of turmoil.

From AD 6 Jerusalem was only a provincial Roman city with a garrison; but that had little influence on the movement of foreigners. For the feast of Passover, and even with some regularity, the Roman procurator from Caesarea came to Jerusalem with a strong escort of soldiers to administer justice.

Thus, given the importance of Jerusalem as the center of Jewish political life, numerous people flocked to it, both for public and private matters. And the political importance of the city also directly and indirectly influenced trade.

Directly, the kings had great needs due to their lavish way of life. To the materials used in the sumptuous constructions, which were to be provided by distant trade, the productions of foreign civilization had to be added.

Indirectly, since always, the political center had been a pole of attraction for national wealth. In Jerusalem were the tenants of the customs house, not only those who leased the customs house from the Jerusalem market, but also those who hired different larger customs officers. Frequent bankers and large merchants also settled in the city. Many of them retired to Jerusalem to spend their capital there and also to die in a holy place.

This capital exerted a double influence on trade. On the one hand, it attracted him to Jerusalem by favoring commercial transactions. On the other hand, it created sales opportunities: rich people could afford great luxuries in clothing, ornaments, etc., and it was above all trade with distant countries that had to satisfy these needs.

c) Religious importance

The temple devoured an enormous amount of materials during the approximately eighty-two years that its construction lasted. The dignity of the sacred house demanded the greatest sumptuousness and the best quality in the materials used, such as black, yellow and white marble, as well as cedar wood. For this reason it is understandable that in the description of the trade of Jerusalem with distant countries the temple represents the most important of the transactions.

For the worship of the temple, the best quality of wood, wine, oil, wheat and incense were also required. Even from India the fabrics for the garments of the high priest on the day of atonement were brought. And the twelve jewels on his breastplate must have been the most precious stones in the world. But, above all, the cult required an enormous number of victims: bulls, calves, sheep, goats, and pigeons. Every day certain victims were offered as public sacrifices of the community. During the Passover festival two bulls, a ram and seven lambs were offered daily as a burnt offering, and a male goat as an expiatory sacrifice. Private sacrifices were also offered daily. They were to be offered to atone for the innumerable transgressions, exactly fixed, which the contamination carried with it, and with these sacrifices legal purity was recovered. On special occasions veritable hecatombs (ie hundreds of animals for sacrifice) were offered. During the festivals, the number of sacrificial victims numbered in the thousands. In this regard, we can consider the magnitude of these sacrifices if we consider that all the cattle that were in the surroundings of Jerusalem, in a radius equivalent to the distance to Migdal-Eder, were considered without more as intended for sacrifices.

But more importantly, the temple attracted huge crowds of pilgrims to Jerusalem three times a year. Especially at Passover Jews came from all over the world. Those masses had to be fed. Certainly, in part they were supplied with the second tithe, that is, with the tithe of all the products of the land and perhaps also of the cattle, which had to be consumed in Jerusalem. But transportation in kind was only possible for those who lived in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem. Those who lived further away were forced to change the products into money to spend it later, as prescribed, in Jerusalem.

Thus, it was the temple above all that gave importance to the commerce of Jerusalem. Through the temple treasury, to which every Jew had to pay yearly dues, Jews from all over the world contributed to the trade of Jerusalem.

Finally, the religious predominance of the city was absolutely decisive for the attraction that it exerted on foreigners. Jerusalem was, above all, one of the most important centers for the religious formation of the Jews. It attracted the intellectuals of Babylon and Egypt and the worldwide reputation of its scholars was an attraction for all classes of students.

Jerusalem was important for the most diverse religious currents. There was the central nucleus of the Pharisees; there we also find Essenes. Religious expectation was tied to Jerusalem. That is why all the messianic movements, very numerous at that time, had their eyes fixed on Jerusalem. Many settled in the city to die in that sacred place and be buried there, where the resurrection and the final judgment would take place.

But, above all, in Jerusalem was the temple, Jerusalem was the homeland of Jewish worship, Jerusalem was considered the place of God's presence on earth. People went there to pray, because it was believed that prayer reached the ears of God more directly there; there the Nazirite offered sacrifices after the fulfillment of his vow, and the non-Jew who wanted to be fully proselyte; there was led, for the judgment of God, the _sôtah_, the woman suspected of adultery. The first fruits were taken to the temple; in it the mothers were purified, after each childbirth, by means of the prescribed sacrifice; there the Jews from all over the world sent the taxes in favor of the temple; To him the different sections of priests, Levites or Israelites addressed themselves, when it was their turn; Judaism from all over the world poured into the temple three times a year.

It is difficult to get an idea of ​​the amount of those congregated on the occasion of the three annual festivals, especially Easter. An approximate number can be 125,000 pilgrims for the Easter festival and about 50,000 inhabitants of the city itself. That is to say, that the influx of pilgrims exceeded by several times the size of the local population.

## The situation of the city for trade

Due to the extension of military protection and the colonizing policy of the Roman Empire, the area influenced by Syria extended further to the east than today. A flourishing culture was emerging in Transjordan. Indeed, the province of Syria, on which Judea then practically depended, occupied, together with Egypt, the first position in regard to trade between the provinces of the Roman Empire. Due to these circumstances, the situation for the commerce of Jerusalem was favorable.

Jerusalem was located in the center of all of Judea. Furthermore, for the Jews of that time, Jerusalem was the center of the inhabited world, the central point of the entire earth, and for this reason the city was called the “navel of the world”.

In addition to its situation, the city also enjoyed easy maritime communications through the ports of Ashkelon, Jaffa, Gaza and Ptolemais, and moreover, it was approximately equally distant from all these ports and occupied a central position with respect to them.

However, Jerusalem did not maintain comfortable commercial relations. Despite its central location in a province with prosperous trade and favorable maritime communications, it was no more than a secluded mountain town.

In the mountains of Judea there have always been numerous caves and hiding places that have been favorable terrain for the activity of robbers. In fact, at the time of Jesus, stories were constantly heard of bandits operating on the roads leading to Jerusalem. The road from Jericho to the holy city, much frequented and dangerous, was called “the road of blood.” (It is precisely on this path that Jesus places the parable of the Good Samaritan). Looting was common in the region, although there was a special court that judged cases of theft and, at the same time, took police action against it.

But the lack of communications from Jerusalem was much more serious than the danger of robberies perpetrated by bandits. The high mountains that surrounded the city made it more of a fortress than a commercial hub.

There is not a single pass in Jerusalem that crosses the watershed in an east-west direction; the closest is far to the north. Jerusalem's communication with the west, and especially with the east, is difficult and uncomfortable. Jerusalem, for this reason, could not constitute a transit point for the products of the rich Transjordan, flourishing at that time, nor be the commercial center for the nomadic tribes of the desert. Consequently, the passage through the Jordan was totally ruled out; the same happens with the one that, not far from the mouth of the Yabboq, establishes communication with Samaria (Sebaste) through the _wadi_ Far'ah. Transjordan's main trade by sea crossed the Jordan rather south of Lake Tiberias, along the route between Gadara and Tiberias, or about 20 km further south,

A single natural route passed through the surroundings of Jerusalem: the route that went in a north-south direction following the dividing line of the waters, and that goes from Nablus (Neapolis, Shechem) to Hebron. Still, this route is one of the least important for Palestinian trade. It is only important for domestic trade. All trade with distant countries had to aim to reach the sea, so this north-south route was only of value in the case of a junction with an east-west communication. But that was precisely where nature had not favored Jerusalem.

However, despite this unfavorable geographical situation for trade, it had considerable importance in the businesses of the area.

## The trading system

The degree of commercial development in which Jerusalem was at the time of Jesus is, broadly speaking, that of an urban economy, or economy of a period in which goods pass directly from the manufacturer to the consumer.

The merchant profession was highly esteemed. There were even priests engaged in trade. And the high priest's family had very lucrative businesses.

Merchandise was brought to Jerusalem from afar by camel caravans, often very large. For trade with neighboring regions, donkeys were also used as beasts of burden. Given the generally poor state of the roads, cars were only used for short distances; Herod had 1,000 built to transport the stones for the construction of the temple. The products from the closest surroundings were brought to the city by the peasants themselves.

The safety of the roads was a vital problem for trade. Herod had proceeded energetically against the banditry then reigning. He sought to ensure tranquility in the interior of the territory and to keep the bordering tribes of the desert within his borders. In the following decades, the Roman government was also concerned with protecting trade. Already in primitive times there was a line of protection against the people of the desert. Under the domination of Trajan, the Romans again undertook the protection of the borders by raising the _limes_.

Once in Jerusalem, the merchant had to pay the dues of the collector who had leased the customs of the city's market. Certainly the collectors, as indicated in the gospels, were mostly Jews. The collection of rights was inexorable.

Once customs was paid, the product was sold in the bazaar corresponding to the merchandise in question. There were several markets: cereals, fruits and vegetables, cattle, wood, etc. There was a market for fattened cattle and there was even a special place for public display and sale of slaves; there the slaves were exposed and sold. The final sellers attracted their clientele by pondering the merchandise, and encouraged them to buy by shouting advertisements. At the time of purchase, great attention had to be paid to the weight, since Jerusalem had its own system. In Jerusalem it was mainly counted by _qab_, and not, as elsewhere, by tenths. Otherwise, this measure of the _qab_ clearly had a special value. The highest measure of capacity, the _seah_, was in Jerusalem a fifth greater than that “of the desert”, and, on the other hand, it was one sixth smaller than the _seah_ of Sepphoris. To do the accounts, merchants and pilgrims could exchange their money at the money changers' stalls.

Of course, Jerusalem also had its own coins: they are the Jerusalem _ma'ah_ and the _sela'_.

Regarding commercial transactions, apart from the general prescriptions about the sanctification of the Sabbath and trade with the pagans, special prescriptions were in force in Jerusalem. Above all, the importation of cattle, meat and impure skins was severely controlled. Prices in Jerusalem were especially high, and land near Jerusalem was especially expensive.

The temple police was in charge of guaranteeing order in commerce. There were managers, appraisers and market watchers. Judgments of the judges in commercial matters were established and the priests had wide jurisdiction to vary the value or price of the sacrificial products of the temple.

Alongside the traditional producer who delivered his wares directly to the vendors in the bazaars, there were also itinerant merchants in Jerusalem who sold spices (they were called _taggerê jarak_, or roasted grain merchants). There were also great merchants; by such are understood businessmen who had employees at their service and who traveled. These were mainly the ones who used the “accounting room” of Jerusalem. Evidently large-scale monetary business was conducted there as well. It was said that, after the great operations, it could happen there, when the accounts are settled, that one would have lost all his fortune. That is why the merchants of Jerusalem paid great attention to the timing of accounts; they did not sign before without knowing who the co-signers were.

## foreign trade

In the time of Jesus abundant trade was flourishing everywhere and Jerusalem, as the Jewish capital, was not exempt from this flourishing.

* Greece. The influence of Greece on the trade of Palestine, either directly or through Hellenistic culture in general, was extraordinarily great. This is indicated by the large number of words of Greek origin that were used, and that referred to all sectors of daily life, but mainly to commerce. Latin words are also found, although in smaller numbers. In Jerusalem there were merchants from Athens and they had long-lasting and intense commercial relations. The most valuable door of the temple was made precisely of Corinthian bronze.
* Lebanon. The coveted wood with which the temple was built came from this country. The wood of this tree appeared everywhere in the holy building, especially in the coffered ceilings.
* Sidon. Sidon's main industry was glassware. Many cups and plates came from this Phoenician city, including the utensils used in the temple.
* Threw. We have already mentioned the fish stalls that the Tyrian merchants had in Jerusalem, in the northern part of the city. Tyre, like the other Phoenician cities, were popular for glassware and for obtaining purple dye. The Jerusalem coin is frequently valued at the value of the Tyre coin, and it is often said that the two were equal to the same. Slaves of both sexes came mainly from Syria via Tyre; sometimes they came from further afield, passing as transit goods through the great slave market of Tyre. The importation of slaves played an important role: in Jerusalem there was a place where slaves were exposed for public sale.
* Cyprus. A very fruitful trade was maintained, especially in dried fruits, such as figs, highly appreciated in the holy city.
* Babylon. The Mesopotamian city supplied precious fabrics: hyacinth, scarlet, silk, and purple. These fabrics were used, for example, to make the veil of the Saint and the tiara of the high priest. The vestments of the acting priest were made of silk, and this material was also used in the liturgy of the Day of Atonement, where a silk cloth was spread between the high priest and the people. In addition, there was a wide assortment of these drapery fabrics in the temple. Spices were also imported from Mesopotamia.
* Persian. Trade relations were also maintained with this country.
* India. Fruitful business was maintained with this country, especially in the chapter on clothing. As an example of this trade, on the evening of the Day of Atonement the high priest dressed in cloth from India.
* Arabian. Relations with this southern country were very intense. The Arabs supplied the country with a large quantity of aromas (probably raw materials for the manufacture of perfumes in Jerusalem), precious stones and gold. Arabian incense was very famous. The perfumes burned in the temple came from Arabic substances. Among the perfumes that were used in the temple we have the cinnamon and the cañafístula. They also had an important copper and iron business. Herod organized wild beast fights in Jerusalem and for this it was necessary to bring lions and other wild beasts from the desert of Arabia.
* Egypt. It was a huge granary for the rest of the countries where there were sometimes grain shortages, as was often the case in Jerusalem. From the eastern part of the Nile delta came the Lint linen, with which the high priest dressed on the morning of the day of atonement. The manufacture of ropes came from Egypt.

In conclusion, trade with distant countries was of great importance to Jerusalem. The needs of the temple were fundamentally what marked the imports to the holy city.

## Trade with nearby regions

Before as now, trade with neighboring regions had to ensure above all the supply of the big city. The main supplies imported into Jerusalem were wheat, oil, cattle, and wood. Judea supplied oil or olives, the rest of Palestine, wheat. Cattle were brought from Transjordan.

a) Wheat and flour

The importance of this cereal made the existence of the inhabitants of the city depend. In times of scarcity this product, which constituted the bulk of food imports, was scarce. The countryside of Jerusalem was all planted with a number of olive trees, cereals and legumes. However, the surroundings of the city were not very suitable for the cultivation of cereals, so the surroundings of the city only covered a small proportion of the needs of wheat and it had to be imported. Most of the wheat was supplied by Transjordan. Hauran was the granary of Palestine and Syria. That is why Herod had been concerned to maintain the security of Transjordan, and thanks to his measures this region began to prosper. Samaria and Galilee also produced wheat. Wheat, wine, oil, and meat were brought from Samaria. Galilean wheat was considered in Jerusalem to be of first quality and therefore usable in the temple. But, because of its transport through pagan territory, it could not be used in the temple and was only used by the population of the city.

Regarding the wheat trade in Jerusalem, there was a wheat market in the city, with considerable transactions, and the sale of flour began immediately after the offering of the sheaf of presentation on _Nisan_ 16. Normally, the wheat was brought from distant regions. Produce from the immediate vicinity was personally brought to market by the small trader; but transportation over long distances was a matter of caravans. The great merchants, not always honest, found in this trade a field of activity particularly suitable for their business. The wheat trade in Jerusalem, important as it was, was not done in the light of day, but rather behind the scenes.

As for the flour for the temple, it had to be of the highest quality. It was brought from Micmas (northeast of Jerusalem), Zanoah (southwest) and Hafarain (west of the plain of Esdraelon), the first two in the province of Judea and the third in Galilee, which denotes the scrupulosity that was followed. when purchasing this flour. It could not come from Samaria or Perea.

b) Fruits and vegetables

In the time of Jesus the surroundings of Jerusalem were a splendid forest. There were numerous plantations of olive trees, as well as vines. There were also date palms and fig trees. Thus, there were plenty of fruit and vegetable plantations in the immediate vicinity of Jerusalem, and these plantations supplied vegetables, olives, grapes, figs, and chick peas. In addition to these products from the vicinity, olives (oil) and grapes (wine) were brought from abroad, especially from Judea. The wine was used in the libations of the temple, and part of that wine was brought from Judea and other Jewish regions, but especially from Judea (such as from the towns of Qeruhaím or Quruthim, north of Jericho, Atulaím, north of Gilgal, Beth Rima and Beth Laban, in the mountains, and Kefar Segana, in the plain).

Among the fruits that Judea produced, the most important was undoubtedly the olive. The oil used as an offering in the temple from outside was brought from Tekoa, in Judea, and from Ragab, in Perea.

In the fruit and vegetable market in Jerusalem we find figs and sycamore fruits. At Passover, the market provided a host of ritually prescribed foods: lettuce, chicory, watercress, thistles, and bitter herbs. Condiments (dill, cumin, mint and others) and crushed nuts were also sold (the ritual jam or jarôset was made with them).

c) Earned

Heavy imports of cattle were made to Jerusalem. They were the basis of the temple sacrifices and the protein diet of the Jews. The rams came from Moab, the lambs from Hebron, the calves from Sharon, and the pigeons from the Royal Mountain or Judean mountains. Animals also came from Arabia and Transjordan. In conclusion: the Judean hills supplied lambs, goats, and doves; Transjordan, beef cattle, especially rams, and Sharon Coastal Plain, steers.

Jerusalem had various animal markets, profane animal markets (Jews were not allowed to eat meat from: pig, horse, mule, donkey, panther, fox, and hare), and sacrificial cattle markets.

1. First there was a market where live cattle were sold.
2. There was also a market for fed cattle, probably a meat market. Chickens were also sold there.
3. In addition to the markets for profane beasts, there were also markets for sacrificial animals. On the Mount of Olives there were two cedars. Under one of them there were four shops where the necessary things for the purification sacrifices were sold: pigeons, lambs, rams, oil and flour. Under the other, 40 _seah_ of pigeons were sold monthly for sacrifices. In Migdal Sabbaaya (Migdal of the Dyers), a town near Jerusalem, there were 300 animal stores for sacrifices and 80 fine woolen stores. In the same temple there was an important trade of these animals, as well as that of the money changers of the temple to make the obligatory payment. This flourishing temple trade was supported by the family of Annas.

d) Other merchandise (stone, wood, wool, pottery, and slaves)

1. In the construction of the houses, stone was used above all, which could be supplied from the outskirts of the city. The stones for the altar and for the stairway that gave access to it were brought from Beth-Kerem.
2. Wood was also used, especially beams for the construction of the roof. At that time, when the surroundings of the city were much more planted with trees than today, most of the wood for construction had been supplied by the nearby regions. The environs of the city ensured the supply for fire wood. Willow branches for the Feast of Tabernacles were brought from Mosa, west of Jerusalem. Wood was also widely used in the temple: as construction, the wood of the cedar of Lebanon; acacia wood for sacred utensils; and for firewood in the daily sacrifices, the wood of fig, walnut and resinous trees such as pine, since olive and vine firewood was not suitable for this use. There were also cedars, laurels and cypresses in the surroundings.
3. People from the countryside went to Jerusalem to sell wool, and sometimes they came from far away.
4. Pottery was also traded in Jerusalem. But if it came from a town more distant from Modit (about 27 km), then it was considered impure.
5. Slaves of both sexes were part of the merchandise. In Jerusalem there was a place for their sale.

## Trips to Jerusalem

a) The journey to Jerusalem

The movement of foreigners in Jerusalem showed great variations that, however, remained almost constant in the different years. The time of the trips began around February or March, which was related to the weather. In these months the rainy season ended and only then could travel be considered; Before, wet roads were a great obstacle. Jerusalem, too, saw most of the foreigners during the dry months, that is, from March to September approximately. During these months the number of foreigners grew enormously three times a year, in the pilgrimage festivals, which brought together pilgrims from all over the world: the Easter, Pentecost and Tabernacles festivals. The highest point was reached every year at Easter.

Once the rainy season was over, everyone made their preparations. The merchant prepared the merchandise for him. Those who went to Jerusalem for religious reasons, for example, to one of the festivals, took advantage of the occasion to take their tributes to the holy city (including the second tithe, which was the one that had to be consumed inside the city) . These are the tributes that had to be brought to Jerusalem: the tax of two drachmas, the _bikkûrim_ (first fruits; although, ordinarily, they were sent collectively to Jerusalem by each of the 24 priestly sections) and the second tithe. Jewish inhabitants of distant countries, such as Mesopotamia, used festival caravans to transport temple money. The corresponding part of the bread dough was also taken to Jerusalem, although it was not necessary, because it could be delivered to the local priest. But, in any case, every Israelite took with him to Jerusalem, in kind or in money, the second tithe.

It was also part of the preparations to find a company for the road. Indeed, because of the prevailing banditry, an individual did not dare to make a long trip alone. For the holidays large caravans were formed.

Generally the journey was made on foot. Evidently the trip was shorter on a donkey. But very rarely was a means of locomotion used to go to or return from Jerusalem. It was the general custom to make pilgrimages on foot. And besides, he considered himself meritorious.

The roads were generally bad. As long as the Sanhedrin, as the first national authority, took care of them, not much was done in this regard, but when the Romans took care of them, the situation improved a lot. It seems, however, that the Babylonian pilgrim route (which started from Jerusalem to the north) was always the object of greater care. Herod the Great strove to ensure their safety. He established in Batanea the Babylonian Jew Zamaris, who protected the caravans coming from Babylon to the festivals against the bandits of Trachonitides.

Such a trip, especially if it was made in a large caravan, had to expect interruptions and delays. Those who returned from the Feast of Tabernacles (celebrated in the month of _tishri_), had to reach the Euphrates before entering _marjesván_, the following month, which means that in half a month more or less they had to travel the not insignificant distance of 600 km, if they did not want to be caught by the first rains.

b) The lodging in Jerusalem

Once they arrived safely in Jerusalem, they had to look for shelter. Generally it was not difficult to find accommodation in one of the hostels in the city; every fairly large town had them. Members of religious communities, such as Essenes or Pharisees, were received by their friends. The inhabitants of Cyrene, Alexandria, the provinces of Cilicia and Asia stayed in the inn attached to their synagogue, located on Ophel. But on holidays it was very difficult to find accommodation. Few were the foreigners who owned their own houses in Jerusalem. The foreign princes of the Herodian family, who came to Jerusalem for the festivals, had prepared a permanent lodging in the palace of the Maccabees, situated immediately on the Xisto,

One of the ten miracles that were told about the city at that time was that all the faithful found accommodation without ever having to say to another: “The crowd is so great, that I can't find where to spend the night in Jerusalem.” A part of the pilgrims could stay in the city itself; only the temple esplanade was excluded as a place of lodging. But it is very possible that the rooms of the temple offered accommodation to pilgrims. However, even taking this into account, it was not possible to house everyone inside the city walls. Another part could stay in neighboring towns, for example in Bethfagé or Betania. (That's where Jesus often stayed.)

The lodging industry lived almost exclusively from pilgrims; These were housed most of the time in large spaces with room for horses and beasts of burden. Now, those attending the Passover feast, the tabernacles and the offering of the firstfruits, were required to spend the night in Jerusalem. The city itself could not accommodate such a multitude of pilgrims. So that they could fulfill that prescription, the enclosure of Jerusalem was enlarged so much that it even included Bethphage. It is what was called the “Great Jerusalem”. This concession was not valid for the eighth day of the Feast of Tabernacles and was hardly valid when the firstfruits were presented. There was also an injunction against renting houses in Jerusalem, since they were the common property of all Israel, and not even the rooms to sleep. That is why many hoteliers forced to leave some type of payment (normally skins), which, despite the prohibitions, meant a profitable business.

c) The movement of foreigners from distant countries

* Gaul and Germany. The walls of Jerusalem sheltered Gauls and Germans. They were part, above all, of the personal guard of the Herodian palace. First they were under the command of Herod, then Archelaus, and after his dismissal, of the Romans.
* Rome. From the year 6 AD Judea was a Roman province; it had a Roman governor, Roman soldiers, and Roman officials. In Jerusalem there was a garrison of auxiliary troops, that is, a miliaria cavalry cohort (_cohors miliaria equitata_), with 800 infantrymen and four _turmae_ of 120 horsemen (30 horsemen each _turmae_) under the command of a tribune, a centurion called _princeps_ (principal) and nine other centurions. This detachment had to be divided between Herod's palace and the Antonia fortress, the two constructions that offered the most protection. Relations with Rome were frequent. There were Romans who lived in Jerusalem, on official mission more often than not. In the garrison of Jerusalem, since the city belonged to a province governed by a procurator, not even the officers were Romans. In Caesarea, on the other hand, the residence of the procurator, was the so-called Italic cohort. These troops accompanied the procurator when he spent the Easter festival there, at which a detachment of soldiers was normally present. Most of the freedmen came from Rome, taken prisoner in Pompey's war and later released. They had their own synagogue, the synagogue of the freedmen (which was also attended by people from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia and Asia), and they stayed in an adjoining hostelry on Mount Ophel. Between the Jews of Rome and the Jerosolomite Sanhedrin there were constant epistolary relations, and what is more, the great Jewish authority had the means to reach the ears of the Emperor, since the Jews of Rome were quite rich and powerful. was the cohort called itálica. These troops accompanied the procurator when he spent the Easter festival there, at which a detachment of soldiers was normally present.

* Greece. We find many Athenians in Jerusalem; private affairs, as well as public ones, provided them with the occasion for intense relationships.
* Cyprus. There were Cypriots living in the city; they are Jews from the island.
* Asia minor. In Asia Minor there was a large Jewish diaspora. That is why there were in Jerusalem representatives from all the regions of Asia. The people came from the province of Asia, from the island of Kos, from Galatia, from Pisidia, from Cilicia (which had their own synagogue in the city) and from Cappadocia.
* Mesopotamia. Between this region and Jerusalem there was considerable dealing. Some high priests were from Babylon (Ananel, between 37-36 BC and again in 34 BC); the well-known Hillel was from Babylon. Many pilgrims from Mesopotamia who came to the festivals gathered by the thousands at Nearda and Nisibe; there they collected the money offered to the temple by the community of Mesopotamia, and then left together for Jerusalem.
* Parthian Empire. The kings and queens of Adiabene were dependent on the Parthians, and had close contact with Jerusalem. Monobazo, Queen Helena and Princess Grapte had palaces there.
* Syria. Among all the non-Palestinian countries, Syria was the country that proportionally had the largest number of Jews. In fact, between Syria and Palestine there were many contacts. Antioch and Damascus were full of Jews who headed out every year for some festival. The inhabitants of Palmyra were also partly Jewish.
* Arabia (Nabataean kingdom). Contacts between Jews and Arabs were even more intense because the Jewish royalty of Jesus' time, the Herodian family, were related to their neighbors to the south. Jewish trips to these lands and vice versa were very frequent.
* Egypt. Egypt, with its large Jewish colony, played a large part in the movement of foreigners from Jerusalem. The Egyptians who lived in Jerusalem, along with other Hellenists, were tied to the same synagogue, sometimes called the Synagogue of the Alexandrians. Several high priests came from Alexandria (Simon son of Boetos, as well as seven other representatives of this family). The great philosopher and theologian Philo lived there. In Leontópolis, Onías had built a temple that tried to question the one in Jerusalem, and that enjoyed a certain consideration in the time of Jesus. However, for every Jew in Egypt, Jerusalem was undoubtedly the true religious center. Example of the great relationship between Egypt and Jerusalem: a supposed Egyptian Messiah formed time after the death of Jesus a crowd around him and promised the fulfillment of the prophecies; he wanted to show his followers the collapse of the city walls from the Mount of Olives. Another example: During a strike of the perfume makers for the temple, they tried to bring Alexandrian artisans, but the attempt failed, because they had no experience.
* Cyrene. There were many Jews also from this province. They even shared with other people the so-called freedmen's synagogue, which had an adjoining hostelry.
* Ethiopia. Even from this remote region came Jews. The Ethiopians of that time were a thriving people who enjoyed good communications and easily reached Jerusalem.

d) The movement of foreigners from nearby regions

The greatest number of foreigners was always provided by the internal movement of Palestine. The commerce of the city mainly attracted the inhabitants of the immediate surroundings. In general, Judea was more tied to Jerusalem than the rest of Palestine. The country was divided by the Romans into eleven Jewish toparchies, no doubt relying on the division of Palestine into twenty-four priestly districts; These toparchies went to Jerusalem to pay their taxes. Police measures concerning Judea fell in part on the shoulders of the Jerusalem authorities and the temple guard who were at their disposal. In certain cases, the courts in the province of Judea requested a decision from Jerusalem. Especially difficult cases were brought before the Sanhedrin, which served as the highest court; in doubtful cases,

Also in the cult of Jerusalem the province of Judea participated more intensely than the rest of Palestine. Only some inhabitants closer to the city could go to the sanctuary to worship on the Sabbath. The witnesses who announced the appearance of the new moon to the competent commission, made up of priests, were from the city or at least from its closest surroundings. Most of the priests lived in Judea. The Galileans did not know the custom of offering something to the priests, since they hardly lived among them. However, not all the priests of Judea lived in Jerusalem.

But, above all, the province of Judea, due to its smaller distance, had the possibility of being more represented in the pilgrimages. It was important in pilgrims Lydda. As distances increased, trade was increasingly conducted by means of caravans and wholesalers; so the participation of the remaining parts of Palestine in the Jerusalem movement was due more to religious duties than to commerce. Only the Samaritans were an exception, since their cult was centralized in the Garizim. Therefore, his interest in Jerusalem, if any, was strictly commercial.

In times of national exaltation, the number of pilgrims to the festivals grew enormously. The gathering of crowds in Jerusalem was also of political importance. It was political reasons that brought together in the city, in the year 6 AD, an innumerable crowd of armed Jews from Galilee, Idumea, Perea and especially Judea, to protest against the abuses of Archelaus. Every messianic movement had to strive to reach Jerusalem. The main focus of the anti-Roman and messianic currents was Galilee. Pilate acted against the pilgrims of a Passover. It was in Jerusalem that the Zealot party was hatched, which later spread successfully to Galilee during AD 6-7, Judas taking control of this area.

# Maqueronte

Maqueronte or Machaerus is the name of a fortress inhabited by Herod Antipas where John the Baptist remained imprisoned and where he was beheaded.

Near the site of the current ruins there is a town called Mukawer, a name given by the Arabs to the existing Roman-Byzantine remains. Next to this town, on top of an isolated and barren hill, stand the ruins of what must have been the fortress. The name that the Arabs have given to the site is Qalaat al-Mishnaqa.

This fortress was one of the most strategic defensive enclaves of the Jewish state in the Perea area on the border with the Nabataean kingdom. The place was erected by the Hasmonean Alexander Jannaeus in 90 BC (BJ VII 6:2). In 57 BC it was destroyed a first time by the governor of Syria, Gabinius, who was sent by Pompey to quell a revolt by the Hasmonean Aristobulus II. The building was razed to ground level.

The palace was rebuilt by Herod the Great beginning in 30 BC (BJ VII 6:2-3). After Herod's death, his son Antipas inherited it as part of the region of Perea. It was in the fortress that John the Baptist was imprisoned and was killed (AJ XVIII 5:1-2,18:109-119; Mt 14:1-12; Mk 6:14-29; Lk 9:7-9). After the death of King Agrippa I (44 AD), the fortress fell under the direct administration of the Roman prefecture.

When the Jewish revolt broke out (AD 66), the Romans abandoned the fort to the rebels (BJ II 18:6), who remained there until AD 72, when Machaero was destroyed by the Romans after a long siege. The first part of the siege was led by General Cereale, and afterward command passed to Lucilio Basso. When the legions finished the wall (_vallus_) and the attack ramp (_agger_), some zealots betrayed their companions and handed over the fortress to the Romans (BJ VII 6).

Later Byzantine bibliographical sources only mention a small town called Macaberos (_Georgii Cyprii Descriptio_, n. 1082; _Cyrilli Vita Sabae_, 82).

The isolated hill on which the fortress stands stands 700 m above sea level and is located at the end of a groyne between the _wadi_ Zerqa Ma'in to the north and the _wadi_ Heidan-Mujib (the Arnon River) to the south. . The mountain, isolated by deep gullies, forms two hills in the southeast and northwest. It can be accessed from the Dead Sea in the west or from the Madaba region in the east.

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/maqueronte.png"></figure>
<em>Maqueronte</em>

Archaeological excavations in the area have clarified the distinction made by Josephus between the upper city and the lower city, the latter situated on the northern slopes. In the upper city there was the royal palace defended by four towers, of which only three have been identified. The remains of the palace are so destroyed that it is difficult to distinguish what corresponds to which period. The upper main structure (possibly from the time of Herod the Great) was divided into two main wings with a paved corridor running from north to south. The east wing ran along the sides of a paved courtyard that covered a cistern with baths on the south and elongated rooms on the north side. The west wing had a peristyle to the north, built on top of a cistern, and connected to a _triclinium_ on the south. Stuccoes, fragments of columns and capitals and Ionic and Doric bases have been found at the bottom of the cistern.

In its final period a polygonal defensive wall was built around the entire perimeter of the upper city, to protect the rebels from the Jewish revolt. Remains of the Zealot presence have been found at the site, such as two ovens on the mosaic floor of the _apoditerium_ and a poorly worked wall on the west side of the _triclinium_.

In the lower city, only a few houses have been excavated within the north wall. The wall was defended on both sides by a tower. Inside the north-west tower there was access to the protected opening of a large cistern.

The upper and lower towns were accessible from the east via a 15m-high bridge connecting the fortress with the plain. It also served as an aqueduct that carried rainwater to cisterns dug into the northern slope of the mountain. A lower aqueduct also served the same purpose for cisterns located at lower elevations.

# South of Samaria

I have to admit that I love these adventures of archaeological exploration from a distance, that is, investigating the discoveries that archaeologists have made regarding the location of the enclaves from the time of Jesus. Not only does it offer me interesting data in order to place the events of the life of Jesus in their context, but it also has an incentive in itself due to its adventurous and exploratory nature.

My next goal has been to locate a group of towns located south of Samaria, on the border between Jewish and Samaritan territory. These towns are: Bethel, Gofna, Ephraim, Arimathea, Tamna, Antipatris, Phasaelis, and Archelais.

I will make a summary of my findings on each of them.

## Betel

Strategically located on the ancient border between the kingdoms of Israel and Judah, and anciently called Luz, it is the second most mentioned biblical city in the Scriptures after Jerusalem. It was there that Jeroboam built his southern temple for the Golden Calf (I Kings 12:25-33), and it was there that Jacob had his dream of a ladder leading to heaven (Genesis 28:10-22). In that time long before Jesus, pilgrims used to travel to Jerusalem along this route and Bethel became a mandatory stop. With the establishment of the Samaritans in the area, the Jews of Jesus' time preferred to avoid this step and did not mind making a long detour across the Jordan each time they went to Jerusalem.


Traditionally it has been considered that the Biblical Bethel corresponds to a more modern population called Beitin. This was corroborated by excavations conducted since 1934 by WF Albright and James L. Kelso. However, the identification contains numerous gaps. There is no trace of Jeroboam's famous temple and no trace of a twin Biblical city called Ai.


That is why it is not surprising that some scholars, such as David Livingston, have proposed another location. Bethel was to be found, according to the church fathers Eusebius and Jerome, twelve Roman miles north of Jerusalem, to the right or east of the road that led to Shechem or Neapolis (present-day Nablus). We also know that Bethel is west of Ai (Genesis 12:8; Joshua 7:2; 8:9,12). But where is Ai? The location, however, of Bethel, following the enumeration of the milestones, does not cause any doubt. Some of these milestones, located in the time of Marcus Aurelius as part of a Roman road, still survive and have been identified. According to the calculation of the twelve milestones, Bethel is located in el-Bireh, an enclave closer to Jerusalem than Beitin, and that it had originally been mistakenly identified with Beeroth (a town known to be only six-seven Roman miles from Jerusalem). el-Bireh is much more in line with the characteristics of Bethel. Geographically it is in a strategic topographical situation, forming a funnel that would make the place a key settlement to defend the region and to locate a great temple there. The Crusaders must have thought so when they built a church and fortress called the Grand Mahomerie on the ruins of an ancient synagogue. The identification using the milestones, in addition, which corroborates Eusebio and Jerónimo, is key. forming a funnel that would make the place a key settlement to defend the region and to place a great temple there. The Crusaders must have thought so when they built a church and fortress called the Grand Mahomerie on the ruins of an ancient synagogue.

The identification using the milestones, in addition, which corroborates Eusebio and Jerónimo, is key.


Therefore, much evidence points to Bethel being considered a Roman mile farther south than has long been considered. The place of this population would be el-Bireh, and the population of Beitin could be a population known as Bethaven (described just in that position by a medieval pilgrim), or it could be some other population, such as those known as Ofra and Zemaraim. As we can see, nothing has ever been decided about the accurate identification of these populations.

It was located fifteen Roman miles from Jerusalem, and only three miles north of Bethel. The current population is called Jifna.

# The Decapolis


The Decapolis was made up of a set of ten cities originating during the Hellenic influence of the 2nd century BC. It was not properly a territory of Palestine, like Judea and Galilee, but rather the area it comprised was approximate and did not have a defined territorial demarcation.

Most of the cities, as we have said, were formed when the descendants of Alexander's generals, Lagids from Egypt and Seleucids from Syria, conquered Palestine. He comprised these ten towns: Scythopolis, Pella, Gerasa, Philadelphia, Hippos, Gadara, Abila, Dium, Raphanah, and Damascus. The most notable were Gerasa, Pella, Hippos, Gadara, Philadelphia, and, further north, Damascus.

They were all in the Transjordan except Scythopolis, which was the only one on the west side of the Jordan. They comprised a somewhat undefined area, as we have said, surrounding Perea to the north and east.

## History


Pompey had granted them municipal autonomy, always under the government and sovereignty of Rome. The Maccabees fought to return these cities to Judaism. But his success was relative. Alejandro Janeo himself had to surrender to the evidence: the Decapolis, despite being embedded in the territories of Israel, was a world apart, clearly Hellenized, under the trade, culture and Greek gods. The case of Pella, for example, was dramatic. He preferred that they destroy it rather than fall under the orbit of Jerusalem. Herod the Great, more cunning than the Maccabees, reached a pact with the Decapolis, benefiting from its undoubted progress.

It must be said that they were not the only Hellenized cities in the Israelite territory. Over time, other cities, such as Ptolemais (ancient Acca or Acre), Gaza and Caesarea (the great port of Israel). Siquem was also rebuilt by Herod, receiving the name of Sebaste and housing an important Greek population. The same would happen with Tiberias and Sepphoris, the capital of Galilee. The Romans, by seizing power in Palestine after the death of Herod, contributed to the estrangement and suspicion between the Jews and the inhabitants of these cities, establishing garrisons in the same paths, with important auxiliary troops of Samaritan origin.

Consequently, the general feeling towards these cities was one of prevention. If you could avoid them, you didn't even go through them. For the Puritans living in Judea, contact with these foreign populations made their person impure. However, these exaggerations were not fulfilled among the more open people of the rest of the regions of Palestine.

## Philadelphia


Located to the south of the Decapolis region.

### History


Excavations inside and outside the modern city of Amman have revealed finds dating back to 3500 BC The occupation of the city, called Rabbath Ammon in the Old Testament, has been continuous and objects found in a tomb dating from the Bronze Age show that the ancient city maintained a great commercial activity with Greece, Syria, Cyprus and Mesopotamia.

Biblical references are many and reveal that by the year 1200 BC, Rabbath Ammon was the capital of the Ammonites. During the reign of King David, he sent Joab in front of the Israelite armies to lay siege to Rabbath, after being insulted by the Ammonite king Nahash.

It seems that David was not the most benevolent of monarchs. After taking Rabbath, he burned its inhabitants alive in a brick oven and, before taking the city, sent Uriah the Hittite “to the forefront of the fiercest battle”, where he would die, simply because David had taken a fancy to Rabbath. Uriah's wife, Bathsheba.

The city continued to prosper and supplied David with weapons for his ongoing wars. His successor, Solomon, erected a temple in Jerusalem to the Ammonite god Molech. As of this moment, the only Biblical references to Rabbath are prophecies of its destruction at the hands of the Babylonians, who did indeed take the city, but did not destroy it.

Amman's history between then (ca. 585 BC) and the time of the Ptolemies of Egypt is unclear. Ptolemy Philadelphus (283-246 BC) rebuilt the city during his reign and named it Philadelphia after his own name. The Ptolemaic dynasty was followed in turn by the Seleucids and, briefly, by the Nabataeans, before Amman was taken by Herod around 30 BC and thus fell to the Romans. The city, which even before Herod's arrival had felt Roman influence as a member of the semi-autonomous Decapolis, was completely replanned and rebuilt in typically Roman grandiose style.



### Description

(see map)

At the time of Jesus we have to imagine Philadelphia as a Roman city in full splendor. The citadel sat on a hill that formed, together with five other hills, a circle. Between these hills, to the south of the citadel, a river crossed the current wadi Abdoun.

The Roman theater was impressive. It was excavated on the northern slope of a hill that formerly served as a necropolis. In the 2nd century AD, another was built on top of the existing one, with room for 6,000 people; the time of Jesus was somewhat more modest. It had not only the entertainment function of a theater, but also a religious one, because on the upper row of seats it housed a statue of the goddess Athena, of special importance to the city.

Right in front of the theater are the remains of a colonnaded plaza that was once part of the city forum.

To the east side of what was the forum is the Odeon, which although it was built around the same time as the Roman theater, there was already one in the same area in the time of Jesus. It was mainly used for musical performances. The seats faced west. It was protected by a temporary fabric roof during performances to protect the musicians and audience from the elements.

The Nimphaeum was to the west of the theater; It had a beautiful decorative facade.

Within the walls of the citadel, on the hill, there were several palaces (nothing remains of them today, it is an assumption). To the south there was a temple dedicated to Hercules (the current ruin belongs to a reconstruction made by Marcus Aurelius). On the north slope of the citadel was a huge rock-cut water cistern.

Presumably there must have been public buildings (perhaps some baths), a small castle or fortress with the Roman troops quartered, temples dedicated to the Greek gods, and the occasional building under construction at that time.


## Escitópolis (Betsán)


At the foot of the ancient fortress on whose walls the remains of King Saul were exposed, one of the most beautiful Hellenistic cities in Palestine was built, called Scythopolis (City of the Scythians) in the 1st century. remember that the garrison was made up of mercenaries from this people of the steppes. It was dedicated to the Greek god Dionysus, whose nurse, Nisa, was buried on the hill according to a tradition brought by Pliny the Elder. Excavations have been carried out that have entirely brought to light the best preserved Roman theater, but from the 2nd century. You should also admire the ruins of the basilica, the large street with colonnades and the Roman odeons, typical of a Roman city with refined urban planning.

Due to the proximity of the Harod river and a sufficient rainfall regime, Beit Shean was a very fertile area with hundreds of hectares of cultivated fields.


## Pella

### History

Although the site was inhabited from as early as 5000 BC and Egyptian texts make several references to it in the second millennium BC, it was during the Greco-Roman period that Pella flourished. The original name of the city, Pehel, seems to have been changed to that of the birthplace of Alexander the Great. Pella followed the fate of many other cities in the area, which came to be successively controlled by the Ptolemies, the Seleucids, and the Jews, who largely destroyed Pella in 83 BC because its inhabitants showed no tendency to adopt the customs of Pella. his conquerors.

Pella was one of the important cities of the Decapolis. During the 1st century AD it was a flourishing place with a good cosmopolitan population of Gentiles and Jews.

### Description

Little to say about a city that is just beginning to be excavated. Walled city since ancient times, with a main mound around which the ancient city was arranged. The most modern zone had extended over a wadi (called today Al-Jirm).

It had a theater or Odeon in this wadi, a Roman Nimpheum or baths, and ultimately, the typical public buildings of the Roman officials who lived there.

The proximity of the Jordan made this city a vital center on the route of the Jewish road through the Jordan. Irrigated crops made the city a place of great wealth.

## Gerasa

The city is a conservation marvel due to the quality of the ruins it preserves. It is located in the hills of Gilead. Today it is called Jerash.

This modern city is located on the eastern bank of a small tributary of the Zarqa River, while the ancient city was on the western bank.

It is estimated that at its time of splendor, Gerasa could house a population of about 15,000 inhabitants (which gives a good idea of ​​its prosperity at the time, and the size that other similar towns could reach).

Although it was not on any of the caravan routes, its inhabitants prospered thanks to the good grain-producing land that surrounds it.

The ancient city that stands today on the western side was the administrative, civic, and commercial center of Gerasa, with most of its inhabitants residing on the eastern side of Wadi Jerash.

### History

Although remains have been found that indicate that the place was inhabited in Neolithic times, it was from the time of Alexander the Great (332 BC) that the city really began to stand out.

In 63 BC the Roman emperor Pompey conquered the region and Gerasa became part of the Roman province of Syria and, shortly after, one of the cities of the Decapolis. In the following two centuries, trade with the Nabataeans was re-established and the city greatly enriched. Local agriculture and iron mining in the Ajlun area contributed to the economic well-being of the city. An entirely new plan was drawn up in the 1st century AD and the main feature was a central colonnaded street crossed by two side streets.

We must therefore think that at the time of Jesus this city was in the process of change and urbanization. Construction activities were thus very important.

Some of the ruins that exist today date back to the time of Jesus, such as the Arc de Triomphe to the south of the city, which Hadrian erected when he lived in this city for a while. However, the rest was much the same as it was when Jesus lived, despite the fact that some of the current ruins rest on buildings erected previously and then enlarged in later times of the Empire.

### Description

(see map)

Coming from Philadelphia the first thing that would come into view would be the racetrack, the old sports arena that used to be surrounded by seats for up to 15,000 spectators. some of the stands have been restored today. The 244 x 50m arena was primarily for athletic competitions and, as its name suggests, horse racing.

The entrance to the main site is from the north. Nearby is the south gate. The gate, originally one of four in the 3,500m-long city wall (very little of it remains), was decorated with acanthus leaves.

Once inside the gate, the Temple of Zeus was the immediate building on the left. It then had a flight of stairs supported by vaults leading inside from a lower sacred precinct. The temple itself was still being built at the time of Jesus. In the lower part or temenos there was an altar and it served as a sacred place for sacrifices. Since ancient times this place had been sacred, containing different temples over time.

The Forum is unusual due to its oval shape, and some attribute it to the desire to elegantly link the main north-south axis (cardo, the classical Roman main street) with the already existing Hellenistic holy site of the Temple of Zeus. In fact, some historians maintain that it was a forum (marketplace) in the strict sense of the word, suggesting that it may also have been a temple-related place of sacrifice. The reconstructed Ionic columns indicate that it was something impressive. The center was paved with limestone and other soft stone blocks. On the center podium was a statue.

The South Theater, behind the Temple of Zeus, was built in the time of Jesus and could seat 5,000 spectators. The rear of the stage was originally two stories high. From the top of the stands there was an enviable view of the city.

At the far end of the forum the cardo, or colonnaded street, stretches for more than 600m to the north gate. The street still retains its original pavement today and ruts left by thousands of cars over the years can be seen.

At the two main crossroads, ornamental tetrapiles were built. The South Tetrapylon consisted of four bases, each with a column supporting a statue.

The cross street (decumanus) runs east, down to a bridge over the small river and on to the Oriental Baths, and west to a gate in the city wall. To the left, before this cross street, was the Agora of the city. It had a fountain in its central part.

About a hundred meters after the crossroads was a temple (forgotten in the time of Jesus) dedicated to the Nabataean god Dhushara.

Following the thistle is the Nimpheum, the city's main ornamental fountain and a temple dedicated to the nymphs. The one that existed in the time of Jesus was replaced the following century by another more luxurious one. The construction, usually two stories high, let the water run down into a pond from which it passed through drains to the street below.

Continuing to the left is the most impressive building in the area, the Temple of Artemis, dedicated to the patron goddess of the city. After the Great Gate of the Temple came two flights of stairs that led to the courtyard where the temple stood. Large vaults had to be built to the north and south of the temple to make the level of the courtyard. Originally the temple was surrounded by columns, but today only the double rows of the front remain, since the columns and other material from which the temple was built were reused for later buildings such as churches.

Continuing down the main street again was the second major intersection and the North Tetrapilon. It differed from the South in that it consisted of four arches supporting a vault.

The Western Baths were coming down from the North tetrapylon. There were some in the time of Jesus and then those that are preserved today were built on top of them.

The North Theater, just west of the Tetrapilon, was smaller than the South Theater. From the North tetrapylon it is only about 200 m to the North gate.

Just to the west and south of the temple of Artemis were other temples dedicated to as many Greek and Roman temples (remember that the population was made up of both).

## Hipos (Susita)

We reproduce the information that was already offered when speaking of the Lake Tiberias region.

It was the second important port on the eastern shore of Lake Tiberias. The truth is that the dimensions and configuration of the docks did not correspond to the thirty houses that made up the village located at the foot of the breakwaters. This village, in turn, was connected to a much denser population (the true Susita), perched 350 m above the level of the lake, on an isolated plateau separated from the sea by a couple of km. The Roman road climbed to the top of the city, later branching off into another, narrower, secondary road that ended at the aforementioned port.

The port had unique characteristics. The main breakwater was 120 m long, with a width at its base of 5 to 7 m. It started perpendicular to the coast, and at 15 m it changed direction, running parallel to the coast, heading south. This second section reached a length of 85 m. Suddenly the embankment changed direction, heading west. This curious inverted Z, undoubtedly battered by the southerly winds, had been closed by a second 40 m breakwater, which started perpendicularly from the coast. The most curious thing was that that 20 m long pier ventured to the west, in relatively deep water (between 4 and 5 m). The reason for such a disproportionate port area was that it was thus used for docking and unloading operations without the need to enter the port.

The explanation for this flourishing city and its associated village is that it had been founded in the 3rd century BC. JC as a flourishing Hellenistic emporium, and after falling into the hands of Pompey, and adhering to the pact that linked the cities of the Decapolis, it was rebuilt, growing and becoming the second urban entity on the eastern coast of the Sea of ​​Tiberias .

## Gadara

Located to the north of the Decapolis, in the vicinity of the Yarmouk River, with views over the Golan Heights and the Sea of ​​Galilee to the North, and the Jordan Valley to the South. It is currently the city of Umm Qais.

### History

The city was captured from the Ptolemies by the Seleucids in 198 BC, and the Jews under Hyrcanus took it from them in 100 BC When the Romans (led by Pompey) conquered the East and the Decapolis was formed, the Gadara's fortunes, taken from the Jews in 63 BC, increased rapidly and typical large-scale construction began.

The Nabataeans controlled the trade routes north to Damascus itself. This interference in the interests of Rome led Mark Antony to send Herod the Great to conquer them. The Nabataean king was finally defeated in 31 BC Herod was given Gadara after a naval victory and ruled it until his death in 4 BC, much to the chagrin of the locals, who had tried everything to put him out of favor from Rome. On his death, the city reverted to semi-autonomy as part of the Roman province of Syria.

Gadara continued to prosper throughout the time after, in the first century of our era and following.

### Description

Las pocas ruinas que nos han llegado nos indican la típica ciudad romana fortificada, con una calzada romana, una calle columnada (que fue probable-mente el centro comercial de la ciudad), y un teatro en la zona oeste. El teatro debía ser colosal, con unas vistas magníficas sobre el mar de Galilea.

The theater and some of the columns are made of black basalt (as are many of the modern houses in the area, built no doubt with materials stolen from the ruins). Further west along what remains of the Roman road, there is a mausoleum and then the baths to the right and, further down, another mausoleum to the left. A few hundred meters more would take us to the almost inevitable contours of what was formerly a racecourse.

Hammat Gader

The Hammat Gader baths were about 10 km from Gadara, down the hill towards the Yarmouk River and the Golan. The area near the river and the springs is very green, making a strong contrast with the steep and arid Golan plateau.

The baths were famous in Roman times for their salutary properties and are still used today. Today they are called Al Hamme

### History

Damascus bills itself as the world's oldest continuously inhabited city, although its rival to the north, Aleppo, ardently disputes this title.

Egyptian hieroglyphic tablets refer to Dimashqa as one of the cities conquered by the Egyptians in the fifteenth century BC, but excavations in the courtyard of the Umayyad Mosque have uncovered finds dating back to the third millennium BC.

Damascus has been the object of many fights and some of its first conquerors are King David of Israel, the Assyrians in 732 BC, Nebuchadnezzar (around 600 BC) and later the Persians in 530 BC In 333 BC it fell to of Alexander the Great. Greek influence declined when the Nabataeans occupied the city in 85 BC Shortly thereafter, in 64 BC, the Romans forced the Nabataeans to leave and Syria became a Roman province. It was here that Saul of Tarsus became Paul the Apostle.

### Description

We are going to make an attempt to approach what the city was like in the time of Jesus.

Old City

Most of the attractions of today's Damascus are in the old city, surrounded by what was the old Roman wall. The wall has been torn down and rebuilt numerous times in the last 2,000 years. The one that stands today dates from the 13th century. But it follows the guidelines of the existing one in the first century.

Various gates opened the way through the wall, but only one of those that exist today (the East Gate) dates back to Roman times.

Citadel

It was located on the western wall. It is being restored today.

temple of Jupiter

It was built in what was formerly a temple to the Aramean god Hadad in the 9th century BC It is an assumption that in the time of Jesus there was a temple to a Roman god here, although the current temple ruins correspond to a temple from the 3rd century AD I suppose which was built to enlarge the existing one. Today the temple is the Umayyad Mosque.

straight street

Famous for a passage in the Acts of the Apostles, where a man (Judas) is mentioned where Paul had to ask about a certain Ananias. It is curious that in Jesus' life this house and street should also exist.

## Abila

Located in the north, on the banks of the nahal Yarmuk, and where a fountain called Abila was located. Little to say about a city that would be very similar to those already mentioned.

## Dium

Another city on the banks of the Yarmuk, on what would be the border with the territory of Philip.

## Rafaná

This city was in the middle of Philip's territory, although like Damascus, it remained autonomous from the Decapolis.

## Other towns

We must mention as populations also belonging to this territory of the Decapolis: Capitolias, Efrom, Gilead, Bosora and Canatá. They did not maintain the independence of the Decapolis, but their position made them confer certain attributes of identity with the league of the ten cities.

### Canatá

City located far to the east. We can say little about this ancient city. The best preserved monument today is known as Seraglio. Historians believe that it was a combination of temples, the most intact building of which dates from the second half of the second century AD We must therefore assume that the Greeks and Romans built a temple in what would be an earlier temple.

To the north from here (to the left from the main façade) you come to a river bank where you can still see the remains of a theater, a nymphaeum and other scattered relics.

### Bosora (Bosra)

The city of Bosra lies between two wadis, both of which reach the Yarmuk River. It is also found to the east, across fertile plains teeming with black basalt killer whales. It was very important in ancient times due to its location at the crossroads of various trade routes.

It is a strange and wonderful place. Apart from having what is perhaps the best preserved Roman theater in existence, the rest of the town is built on, in and around the remains of ancient Roman buildings, almost entirely raised with blocks of black basalt.

### History

Bosra is mentioned in Egyptian records as early as 130 BC and during the 1st century AD it became the northern capital of the Nabataean kingdom; the southern capital was Petra.

In 106 AD the area was annexed by the Romans and Bosra became the capital of the Arabian Province, renamed Nova Trajana Bostra.

### Description

(see map)

The citadel is a curious construction as it largely consists of a fortified Roman theatre. Both structures are in fact the same (the fortress was built around the Roman theater to make it an impregnable redoubt).

Upon entering the citadel it is surprising to see this magnificent theater with capacity for 15,000 people. Compared to other theaters of its time, it is unusual because it does not lean on the side of the mound, as was usual, but stands on its own.

The stage is delimited at the back by rows of Corinthian columns and the entire façade was originally covered in white marble. A wooden roof used to cover the stage, while the rest of the theater was protected from the elements by all silk. As if this were not enough refinement, the environment was sprinkled with perfumed water that fell finely on the heads of the spectators.

To the north of the citadel is the main street of the old city which runs approx. in an east-west direction. At the western end is the Great Gate of the Wind. Along the main street you can see remains of the columns found in excavations.

Another vestige are four huge Corinthian columns, remains of the nymphaeum, which supplied water to people and gardens.

Just behind is another column from what remains of a temple erected by a king of Bosra to protect his daughter against death.

Right in front were the Roman baths. They consisted of a series of bath rooms in which the bather went through submerging himself in them until finally reaching the steam bath.

Due to the presence of churches on the main street we must assume that they were perhaps built on what were pagan temples.

At the eastern end of the street are the Nabataean gate and column. The gate is the main entrance to the palace where the Nabataean king Rabel II lived. The column is the only one of its kind in Syria and supports the typical simple Nabataean capital.

A little further from the town are two cisterns that used to supply water from the city.


**POLITICS** 

# Pontius Pilate 

Several origins are accepted for the name Pilate. One is that it may have meant “handy with the pilum,” the pilum being the typical iron-tipped javelin of Roman soldiers. We have a more definitive origin in the worshipers of the Dioscuri, a cult that was widespread in Sarmata and Dacia. Many descendants of the great king of the Dacians, Burebista, were called Pileatus. This places the ancient family of Pontius in these regions of the empire. 

One tradition suggests that Pontius was of Samnite origin, an ancient region of Italy, and that his name was derived from pileus, the symbol cap of the freed slave, suggesting that his ancestors were freedmen. It is believed that he may have been a descendant of the Samnite general Gaius Pontius.

Tiberius appointed him the fifth prefect (and not procurator, as he is sometimes incorrectly designated) of an area in Jewish territory that included Judea, Samaria and Idumea, and which until AD 6 had been under the rule of the ethnarch Archelaus, son of Herod I. 

Like all prefects, Pontius belonged to the equestrian order (_ordo equester_), the lowest of the two Roman aristocratic orders, below the senatorial order. Its members were called _eques_ (plural _equites_), or knights. 

## The altercations he provoked against the Jews

From the moment Pilate took office, in the summer of 26 AD, the altercations did not stop. We have talked about these events in another article (Pacifism in the time of Jesus), so here we will limit ourselves to summarizing them, offering an approximate chronology:

During the winter of 26 AD or early 27 AD, Pilate sends a reinforcement detachment to Jerusalem, which brings in the Roman insignia and banners. These symbols, which were almost revered by soldiers, were not tolerated by Jewish religious law, which forbade any human or animal representation. The Roman banners were called _signum_ (a pole containing several discs and a hand), _vexillum_ (a pole with a small red flag embroidered with an eagle), and the _imagine_ (poles with a bust of the emperor's head at the end) . The leaders of Jerusalem and the tetrarchs Antipas and Philip sent delegations to Caesarea, where Pilate was present, to protest this outrage. Pilate rejected their proposals. Then a retinue of representatives of the people together with a large population went to Caesarea. After five days demonstrating in front of Pilate's palace, and without Pilate granting them an audience, Pilate finally meets them in the city stadium, where he listens to their propositions but under threat of death he orders them to give in. And he surrounds them with soldiers. The Jews prostrate themselves on the ground assuring that they are ready to die. Pilate, impressed, recants and orders the removal of the insignia from Jerusalem.

Not recovered from the humiliation of the previous event, Pilate looks for another way to confront the Jews. In the summer of 27 AD he had some shields with inscriptions of the emperor, without any image, placed on the walls of the palace of Herod the Great in Jerusalem, which is where the troops are stationed next to the Antonia fortress. The fact that the Jews were shocked again clearly indicates that it was not because of the icons that these objects were offensive, but rather because they were sacred to the Roman troops. Again the four sons of Herod the Great who lived in Palestine (among them the tetrarchs Antipas and Philip), together with the religious leaders, protest this new provocation. But Pilate does not pay attention because he considers that with these shields no religious law is violated. So the Herodians and the influential Jews send a message to Emperor Tiberius. The response, ordering the withdrawal of the shields, must have arrived after two months, in the autumn. Pilate suffered yet another dishonorable defeat.

During the year 27 AD Pilate had to decide that the aqueduct that supplied water to Jerusalem, which was built by Herod the Great and was already very old, had to be improved and rebuilt. He must have discussed the matter with the Sanhedrin, since to a large extent, the provision of water was their responsibility, since much of the water was consumed for the performance of the temple rituals. But it seems that the Sanhedrin was not very willing to collaborate in this work. They must have argued that they had no money for that purpose. The money from the temple's tax collections, called _corban_, was not considered money available for these purposes. The Jews considered this treasure as something sacred, only available in cases of extreme need, and above all to finance the religious aspects of the town. Pilate saw an opportunity to atone for his earlier mistakes. So at the end of AD 27 he forcibly seized a portion of the temple treasury with the intention of using it for this purpose. The aqueduct reform works must date from the end of that year. This aqueduct ran from Solomon's Pool in Jerusalem to the southwest of Bethlehem, in a town called Ethan. However, this fact constituted a new outrage for the Jewish people, who, taking advantage of Pilate's stay in Jerusalem, surely on the occasion of Passover in 28 AD, did not hesitate to protest en masse. A huge crowd gathered in front of the Antonia fortress. Pilate agreed to listen to the delegation and sat in his court. But his benevolent intentions were just a farce. While the hearing was taking place, Pilate deployed among the people soldiers disguised as Jews carrying spiked clubs. When, at the refusals and words of Pontius, the people, upset, begin to insult and insult the prefect, Pontius gives an order to the soldiers, who begin to beat the crowd. In the midst of the commotion, many people are trampled to death by their own countrymen or by Roman soldiers. The Jews, despite being caught by surprise, defend themselves and cause the death of soldiers as well. The end result, a massacre. But the town seems to quiet down. There will be no more delegations. In the midst of the commotion, many people are trampled to death by their own countrymen or by Roman soldiers. The Jews, despite being caught by surprise, defend themselves and cause the death of soldiers as well. The end result, a massacre. But the town seems to quiet down. There will be no more delegations.

The Jews, despite being caught by surprise, defend themselves and cause the death of soldiers as well. The end result, a massacre. But the town seems to quiet down. There will be no more delegations.

According to _The Urantia Book_ ([UB 185:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_5)), data that no ancient literature confirms, this event, far from being forgotten, caused no less than twenty disturbances, surely all concentrated in Jerusalem, during the year 28 AD Possibly the Roman troops based in Judea received attacks from Jewish radicals, and some soldiers died. Pilate had to suppress these revolts rigorously, looking for the causers and crucifying them. Golgotha ​​in Jerusalem must have been a crowded place during this year. It is curious, but if any of these altercations occurred during the Passover of 28 AD Then Jesus and his disciples were witnesses to the event, since they were in Jerusalem, according to _The Urantia Book_. And yet, no event of this kind is mentioned in The Book.

Finally, we do not know very well the cause of this, some Galileans who were in the temple performing their rites must have ignited the anger of the Jerusalem tribune, who, following the orders of Pontius, attacked them. Perhaps they grappled with the soldiers, and in the end the melee caused many to die even within the sacred precinct. The blood of those men, which was spilled on the paving of the temple, must have polluted the place during certain days, a fact that provoked the indignation of all the people. Surely the protests of the Herodians and the Sanhedrin reached Tiberius again, but it seems that this time no contrary orders came from Rome. This last altercation is mentioned in the Gospels (Lk 13:1-5). 

## Pontius Pilate and Jesus

The event that obviously completely fills the interest in this character who otherwise would have gone through total anonymity, is undoubtedly Jesus. During the preaching of Jesus, the Master had passed through Samaria without attracting the attention of the prefect, who, as we see, was not a man concerned with the religious affairs of the Jews. Thus, there Jesus was able to preach in peace in the area under the direct rule of Rome, if it were not for the fact that this territory, that of the Samaritans, did not have the sympathy of the Jews.

However, the Sanhedrin knew how to confuse him very well during his stay for the Passover of the year 30 AD to authorize the death of Jesus. It is curious to note the fact that if Pilate had not been in Jerusalem for this Passover, as seems to have happened in other years (in which the prefect did not force himself to visit Jerusalem given the heated mood of the Jews), the events they could have taken place completely differently. We have an example of this in Luke's account of the arrest of the apostle Paul (Acts 21:27-40). The Sanhedrites conspire against him, but as the prefect is not present, it is the tribune of the Jerusalem garrison who takes charge of the arrest. His intention is to flog the prisoner and then leave him, but seeing that he deserves to be judged by the prefect he is sent to Caesarea.

As things happened, Pilate again fell into the error of allowing the influences of the Sanhedrin on Tiberius to force him to give up his timid defense of Jesus. Since Pilate did not care about the death of a Jew (what really prolonged Jesus' trial somewhat was Pilate's desire to oppose the Jewish Sanhedrin), he finally handed him over, not without one last small victory: placing a sign over his cross that said “Jesus, king of the Jews”, something offensive to the Hebrew mentality. Not even a message from his wife (Mt 27:19), Claudia Procula, who had apparently become a believer in Jesus through a maid, made him change his mind. Later Christian traditions elevated Pilate's wife to a prominent position in the nascent Christianity,

## The end of his political career 

In the end, the constant clashes with the Jews were the cause of the end of Pilate. There was a belief among the Samaritans that the sacred vessels of the temple had been buried, since the time of Moses, on Mount Gerizim. A Samaritan promised in AD 35 to bring the vessels to light if the people gathered on that mountain. The most credulous listened to him, and large crowds of armed Samaritans flocked to the town of Tiratana, at the foot of the mountain.

But Pilate, aware of this congregation, and believing that a revolt could be organized, sent his troops against the believers. Some died, others were captured. Pilate sentenced the most distinguished to death. The Samaritans, stunned by the fierceness of Pilate's repression, turned to Vitellius, legate from Syria, explaining that the nature of the event had been purely religious and not seditious. Vitellius sent Pilate to Tiberius to answer for his conduct and handed over the administration of Judea to Marcellus.

The journey from Judea to Rome must have taken Pilate about a year, since he did not reach the capital until after Tiberius's death. We know nothing with certainty of his subsequent fate. With the expansion of Christianity, the figure of Pilate gained more interest in the historians of the nascent Church. Some make him die executed by Tiberius, repentant for the condemnation of Jesus and converted to Christianity. Eusebius describes him being exiled by Caligula in Gaul, and later committing suicide in Vienna. Others committed suicide in Rome, or in Lausanna (Lake Geneva) or in Lake Lucerne (where the place is still shown to tourists today). Others executed by Nero. Even the Coptic Monophysite church came to venerate him as a saint. _The Urantia Book_ leans towards suicide in Lausanna ([UB 185:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_6)).

# Herod Antipas 

## Relationship with his father Herod

Herod Antipas was the son of Herod I and a Samaritan named Maltace, one of the many wives that Herod I had. Since childhood he had to live in an environment full of hostility between his father and his half-brothers, who often clashed with their father for his mistrust, some really well founded. Both Antipas and his direct brother Archelaus seem to have stayed away from these domestic disputes, perhaps because they considered his stepbrothers, older than them, with more right to the succession of his father. 

## The tumultuous year 4 BC 

The father, Herod I, died in March 4 BC, shortly after a lunar eclipse that occurred on March 13. All the people, who already knew the serious condition of the monarch due to illness, anxiously awaited the news.

Herod was turning the end of his reign into an ordeal for the people. Unable to solve his domestic problems, he finally executed three of his sons, Alexander and Aristobulus in 7 BC, sons of his second wife, Mariamme, and Antipater in 4 BC, five days before he died, the only son of his first wife. woman, Doris. That further paved the way for the rest of the living children to have more options for the succession. Herod had already announced in a second testament his intention to leave the throne to his son Antipas, but to his disappointment and to the surprise of his brother Archelaus, his father had made a third testament, changing his will just a few days before his death. , and bequeathing his kingdom to Archelaus.

Archelaus, the eldest son, was appointed king of his entire kingdom. But he also gave the title of tetrarch of Galilee and Perea to Antipas, and the title of tetrarch of the lands to the east and northeast of Galilee to Herod Philip, a half-brother of Antipas and Archelaus, the result of his father's union with Cleopatra of Jerusalem, other woman. 

Because Herod had died shortly before Passover in 4 BC, the crowds gathered for the feast, hearing the news, caused many riots and riots. They demanded that justice be done to two Pharisees that Herod I had executed at the instigation of some of his advisers.

Archelaus sent a detachment of soldiers to the temple but far from ending the demonstrations, many of his soldiers died and had to withdraw. In view of this situation, he gathered all his troops and causing a terrible slaughter, finished with the insurgents. 

Archelaus, seeking a quick confirmation of his office by Emperor Augustus, left his older brother Philip as administrator of the kingdom, traveling to Rome. Antipas also did the same, traveling to Rome to claim the throne, in view of his brother's poor management skills. In Rome, in addition, lived many members of the Herodian family, who, upon hearing the news of the succession of Herod, opposed the appointment of Archelaus, and requested the emperor to welcome the kingdom under his direct rule.

For a few days, Antipas and Archelaus conspired with each other in Rome to bring the balance closer to Augustus' decision. The emperor convened a council in his palace to hear the justifications of each party. In defense of Antipas spoke one Antipater, probably a close friend of the tetrarch, and in defense of Archelaus spoke Nicholas of Damascus, a wise man of great learning who had previously worked for his father. Each tried to win over the emperor, both by extolling his virtues and the opponent's flaws. Finally, Augustus decided on Archelaus, although he did not make the decision immediately and in principle the council was dissolved without pronouncing sentence. 

However, a few days later he leaned in favor of Archelaus, considering him more worthy to occupy the throne.

While Augustus was making up his mind, a veritable rebellion broke out in Judea. After Herod's death, and while Archelaus was on his way to Rome, a new revolt broke out. On this occasion the governor of Syria, Varus, decided to go with his troops to Jerusalem to restore order. Once the mutiny was suppressed, leaving a detachment, he returned to Antioch.

While Augustus was making the decision as to who was to be his successor, he sent Sabinus to Jerusalem as temporary procurator. But this man so oppressed the people and behaved so arbitrarily that no sooner had Varus left him with his troops than another rebellion broke out. It was the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) in the year 4 BC and there was a large crowd of pilgrims in Jerusalem. The people divided into several groups and attacked the Romans from several fronts: to the north of the temple, to the south near the hippodrome, and to the west of the city, near the royal palace. The fiercest battle took place around the temple. The Roman soldiers managed to push the Jews back into the temple courts, but there they fought a bitter fight, climbing onto the roofs of nearby buildings and throwing stones at the infantrymen, who were forced to resort to fire; they set fire to several buildings and thus finally conquered the hill on which the temple stood. The treasure of the sanctuary fell into his hands as booty and Sabinus himself seized 400 talents, quite a fortune.

But the Jews returned to the charge. They managed to enlist some soldiers of the Herodian guard in their cause, relaunching their attack and this time managing to put Sabinus and his detachment in trouble, until they were surrounded in the royal palace. 

Meanwhile, around Sepphoris in Galilee, a certain Judas, son of Hezekiah, whom Herod had long ago humiliated, organized a group around him, seized the royal armory, distributed the weapons among his followers, and converted Galilea in a real battlefield, even coveting the royal title.

While these riots were going on, we have to think, as [UB 123:0.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p0_6) tells us, that Jesus was still staying in Alexandria, in Egypt. These events that occurred in Galilee took place around May - June 4 BC, while according to what we are told, Joseph, Mary and the child returned to Nazareth in October of that year. It is evident that Joseph, in good prudence, did not return to Nazareth until everything had calmed down. 

In Perea, in turn, a former slave of Herod I, named Simon, led a band and also had himself proclaimed king, but was defeated shortly after by the Romans and executed.

Finally, Josephus tells us about a shepherd named Atronges who also imposed himself the royal crown, and who together with his four brothers set out on raids throughout the country. 

As we can see, they were a truly convulsive couple of months, where the absence of a clear king led to delusions of grandeur by many, and especially by the common people, who were eager to get rid of the hated Herodian monarchy. 

In view of the situation, Governor Varus hurried back from Antioch, with his two remaining legions, to try to restore order again. On the way, he was joined by Nabataean troops sent by the friendly king Aretas and by other vassal kings, from nearby kingdoms who did not feel much esteem for the Jews and wanted to ingratiate themselves with Rome.

The city of Sepphoris, where Judas the rebel had established his headquarters, was burned, completely destroyed, and its inhabitants, as traitors, all sold into slavery. From there Varus continued on to Samaria, which he pardoned for not having taken part in the revolt, and from there he proceeded to Jerusalem, where the legion stationed there and led by Sabinus was cornered in the royal palace. 

Varo did not have to suppress any resistance. As soon as the Jews saw the two legions arrive with all their machinery and troops, their spirits sank, and in fear they fled. Varus soon took control of the situation in Jerusalem. Once the city was calm, Sabinus, as soon as he had the opportunity, said goodbye to Varo, putting in a safe place the fortune stolen from him, marching towards Rome.

Varo, not wanting to leave loose ends this time, carried out a thorough inspection of the entire countryside and of those towns where he suspected that some insurgents might still be taking refuge. As a lesson to the people, he had two thousand Jews crucified, but extended a pardon to the rest, wishing to end it without further reprisals. Later, he returned to Antioch.

Apart from these terrible events in Judea, the contenders for the throne continued to contend in Rome, awaiting the imperial decision. During that time, even, a Jewish embassy appeared before Augustus requesting that he not finally give authority to any of the Herodians, but that a Roman take charge of the region who would allow them, yes, to continue living under his laws. To add to the complications, the last of the brothers in the will, Philip, arrived in Rome at that time to assert his rights as well.

It is curious but it is remarkable to perceive that these events fit very well with the parable of the talents that Jesus later recounted, as if his parable were inspired by these historical events: «A nobleman (Archelaus) went to a distant nation (Rome ) to receive a kingdom (Judea) and then returned, but his subjects hated him and sent an embassy after him saying 'We do not want this man to rule over us' (Lk 19:12-27 and Mt 25:14-30) . _The Urantia Book_ delves into this topic with very clarifying explanations ([UB 171:8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p8), “The Parable of the Minas”).

After hearing all the parties bring them together in the temple of Apollo, and after much thought, Augustus finally made his decision, which basically confirmed the late Herod's will. Archelaus would reign over Judea, Samaria, and Idumea, but the cities of Gaza, Gadara, and Hippos would nonetheless pass into the circumscription of Syria, and Archelaus would not hold the title of king but the lesser title of ethnarch. Antipas received Galilee and Perea (a territory divided in two by the wedge of the Decapolis) with the title of tetrarch, and Philip received Batanea, Trachonitides and Auranitides. As obligations Augustus imposed a rent of 600 annual talents for Archelaus, 200 for Antipas and 100 for Philip. Salome, the sister of Herod the Great, who also appeared in the will, got her fair share, that is,

## The reign of Antipas

On his return, and while his Archelaus was at his wits' end, Antipas shrewdly tried not to cause too much unrest among his Jewish subjects. He set about rebuilding Sepphoris, destroyed by fire at the hands of Varus's soldiers, and surrounded it with strong walls. This explains why _The Urantia Book_ places Joseph and Jesus as workers at Sepphoris. Joseph died precisely in a work accident in Sepphoris while working on the construction of the residence of Antipas on Tuesday, September 25, 8 AD, when Jesus was 14 years old ([UB 126:2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2) ). Claiming money owed to his father at the time of his death led Jesus to learn of Herod's usury in person ([UB 126:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_7)), during the year 9 AD,

To defend Perea, Antipas fortified Betaranta, a city in which a palace of Herod I had been destroyed during the revolt of 4 BC, and gave it the name of Livias in honor of the emperor's wife and later Julias when the wife of Augustus she was admitted into the Julia family. Also, to ingratiate himself with the Nabataeans, with whom he had a border, he agreed to marry the daughter of King Aretas. He was possibly dissuaded by Augustus himself from celebrating this marriage. But this union was not for love, and that brought Antipas problems later.

To display all his architectural ambition, in the style of his father, Antipas planned a new and splendid capital of his kingdom, Tiberias or Tiberias, named in honor of the new emperor Tiberius. He selected an enviable location, on the western shore of the Sea of ​​Galilee, next to the Amatus Falls (Hammat). But the selection of the site did not meet with the approval of the Jews. Apparently, during the clearing of rubble several funerary monuments had appeared. It was an old cemetery. This was a stumbling block for the Jews, since contact with places of the dead made them impure for ritual celebrations.

But Herod was not willing to choose another place. He had loved the chosen one, so he went out of his way to bring all kinds of foreign people and opportunists. In the end, possibly, the less observant Jews began to give in, as over time it became a typical Jewish town. In the construction of the city he squandered all the proceeds from him. He built a _stadium_, a royal palace (the latter apparently offensive to Jews because of its images of animals according to Josephus), and a very large _proseuché_ or Jewish synagogue. As for administrative buildings, these followed Hellenistic customs, with a _boulé_ of 600 members, with an _archón_ and a council of _ décha protoi_, as well as _hiparcas_ and an _agoránomos_. The city was founded around AD 17-20, and was under construction for the rest of Jesus' life.

During Pilate's prefecture (26 - 36 AD), Herod cunningly played friendship - enmity with Pontius. Probably sometime during the period between 27 - 29 AD is when Pilate had his troops enter Jerusalem with the insignia of the army, causing a conflict with the Hierosolomite authorities that ended with the humiliating defeat of Pontius in the stadium of Caesarea. . Antipas probably sent ambassadors to deal with this matter with Pontius. After this incident, Pontius had the imperial shields placed in Herod's palace in Jerusalem, causing Jewish unrest. When the conflict escalated, Antipas and his half-brother Philip scored a point with the people by leading, along with two other half-brothers, a retinue before the emperor to protest the act of Pilate (as Philo tells). As finally Tiberius, indignant with Pilate, ordered to remove the shields and take them to Caesarea Maritima, that event remained as a Jewish triumph and that of the tetrarchs. Possibly this fact explains the initial enmity between Pilate and Antipas (Lk 23:12). Schürer is of another opinion, indicating that this event could not have happened before 31 AD, that is, when Jesus had already died.

Although Antipas did not believe in the Jewish religion, he was very superstitious, and tried, following the example of his father, not to anger his subjects too much. In this sense, he outwardly tried to behave like a pious Jew, going during the Passover festivals to Jerusalem (Lk 23: 7), where he stayed in the old royal palace of his father, which the Romans did not usually occupy. I draw these last conclusions from _The Urantia Book_ ([UB 185:4](/en​​/The_Urantia_Book/185#p4)), because there is no historical data to confirm what was his habitual residence in the city.

Before making a visit to Rome (the embassy to protest against Tiberius? or another one?), it is not known when, he visited his half-brother Herod, son of Mariamme, the famous wife of Herod, daughter of a high priest, and who was the eventual successor of Herod I in his first testament. In his mansion he met Herodias, daughter of Aristobulus, the rebellious son who had been executed by Herod I in 7 BC, and was captivated by her beauty. His stepbrother and Herodias must have been married for quite some time as they already had a young daughter, Salome (surely born around 10 AD).

Herodias was an ambitious woman who had seen her dreams of greatness frustrated when Herod changed his will to the detriment of her husband. Therefore, when he found that Antipas had fallen madly in love with her, he did not hesitate to accept her marriage plans upon his return from Rome. 

While Antipas was making that trip, his wife, the Nabataean, had found out about all these tricks of the tetrarch. On her return, with the excuse of paying a visit to Machaero, she asked him to let her go to her fortress. Antipas agreed. But when she hardly got there she ran away to Petra to the house of her father, to whom she made known the crooked machinations of her husband. Since then, the Nabataean king Aretas was displeased with Antipas, waiting for the opportunity to take revenge for his daughter's affront.

Two events that mark his reign and our history is Antipas's relationship with John the Baptist and with Jesus. John starts preaching about him in 25 AD (according to _The Urantia Book_). In the summer of 26 AD, because of the Baptist's increasingly bitter criticism of Antipas, especially for his sinful marriage to Herodias, he is arrested and imprisoned in Machaero (according to what only Josephus tells us and not the evangelists). On Antipas's birthday, January 10, AD 28, John is executed by the tetrarch. Apparently, in the middle of the party and intoxicated by the wine, the ruler is so pleased with a dance by his stepdaughter Salome (daughter of Herodias and her former husband Herod), that he grants her the possibility of a wish, whatever she wants. Herodias takes advantage of the occasion to manipulate his daughter and request the beheading of the prophet.

Antipas very much regretted his concession but did not have the strength to go back on it and regretted his decision for the rest of the following years, so much so that when Jesus enters the scene in all his splendor after John's death, Antipas, very superstitious, comes to believe that perhaps he was a reincarnation of the Baptist (Mt 14:1; Mk 6:14; Lk 9:7-9). Antipas tries to meet Jesus (Lk 9:9), but it seems that his intention was rather to imprison him (Lk 13:31). Finally, when Jesus is imprisoned in Jerusalem during the Passover, Antipas, who, as he used to do, was also there, manages to meet him. Pilate, as a gesture of courtesy, sends him to judge, but Antipas does not want to be the executioner of another good-natured prophet, and after ridiculing Jesus, he returns him to Pilate. From that day,

## The end of his reign 

We know from Josephus of other events that took place just before the death of the emperor Tiberius, which occurred on March 16, 37 AD The chronology of these events, however, is not clear, and what I offer here is a possibility following the available documentation.

Around AD 35 or 36, the Parthian king, Artabanus, had repeated negotiations with the Romans. The representative of Rome was Vitellius, governor of Syria. Antipas seems to have been present at these negotiations as well. It seemed that things were heading favorably when the threats of Vitellius and the abandonment of the subjects of Artabanus forced him to flee to more remote provinces. Vitellius, taking advantage of this situation, in the summer of 36 AD, went to the Euphrates together with Tiridates, pretender to the Parthian throne favorable to the Romans, and established the latter as sovereign.

It seems that during this summer of 36 AD, surely taking advantage of the fact that Antipas was on the Euphrates supporting Vitellius's negotiations, King Aretas attacked Perea, supposedly because of a territorial dispute over a border area called Gabalítid. The reality is that the Nabataean king was waiting for the opportunity to make amends for Antipas' outrage against his daughter.

Antipas must have received the declaration of war on the Euphrates, and he does not hesitate to send orders to repel the attack, but he suffers a complete defeat. King Aretas, satisfied, takes possession of the area in conflict, of little importance, and falls back again. His honor has been satisfied. Antipas, receiving the news of the defeat, begs Vitellius to help him by sending his troops against Aretas, but Vitellius's mission is different and he tells Antipas that he will have to ask the emperor for permission to remove him from his current mission. Antipas sends messengers to Rome to report the excesses of Aretas. As the message travels to Rome, at the end of AD 36 Artabanus returns to his region, puts Tiridates to flight, and regains power. Vitellius and Antipas set out again, pitch their tent on the Euphrates,

Antipas, wanting to ingratiate himself with the emperor so that he would grant revenge against Aretas, anticipates Vitellius and communicates the success of the treaty with Artabanus through a messenger. Vitellius, sensing the tetrarch's tricks, gets angry with Antipas. Meanwhile, the emperor's message is not long in coming: Aretas' insult must be avenged. Tiberius' orders are for Vitellius to send his troops against the Nabataean king, capturing him dead or alive. Vitellius gets to work very reluctantly, because he was at odds with Antipas. But since he could not disobey the emperor, he set out to fight Aretas. Ordering his army to march against Petra, he requested a long detour around Judea to avoid stirring up the Jews with military banners. Surely Antipas, who traveled with Vitellius and the legions, He was impatiently encouraging the governor to hurry up. But Vitellius, disgusted with Antipas, to make him more nervous, and behaving like a devout Jew, stops for several days to personally attend the Passover of 37 AD in Jerusalem, leaving his troops on the other side of the Jordan. While they are there, news of Tiberius's death is received from Rome. Vitellius then felt released from carrying out the imperial orders and returned with his army to Antioch, to resume his negotiations with Artabanus. Antipas's defeat, therefore, to Antipas's disappointment and humiliation, remained unavenged. leaving his troops across the Jordan. While they are there, news of Tiberius's death is received from Rome. Vitellius then felt released from carrying out the imperial orders and returned with his army to Antioch, to resume his negotiations with Artabanus. Antipas's defeat, therefore, to Antipas's disappointment and humiliation, remained unavenged. leaving his troops across the Jordan. While they are there, news of Tiberius's death is received from Rome. Vitellius then felt released from carrying out the imperial orders and returned with his army to Antioch, to resume his negotiations with Artabanus. Antipas's defeat, therefore, to Antipas's disappointment and humiliation, remained unavenged.

The first gesture of the new emperor humiliated Antipas even more. Caligula granted Agrippa, a brother of Herodias to whom the tetrarch had apparently not paid much attention, the royal title of Philip and his tetrarchy. Agrippa, who had been a nobody all his life, ignored by his brother-in-law Antipas, landed in Rome and was fortunate to befriend Caligula. At first it seems that Agrippa did not take being king very seriously, but around AD 38 he made his way to Palestine and presented himself there as king.

Herodias, instigating Antipas's ambition, invited her husband not to lose credibility in the eyes of the new emperor, and the couple went to Rome to request Caligula's support and obtain the royal title to the detriment of their relative. After them, a freedman of Agrippa named Fortunatus also leaves for Rome, with a list of charges against Antipas, accusing him of collusion with Sejanus (died 31 AD) and with Artabanus, and giving evidence of an arsenal of weapons that Antipas kept. The objections convince the new emperor that he depose Antipas of the tetrarchy from him in the early summer of AD 39, granting Agrippa the title of king and all his honors. According to Josephus, Antipas was banished by Caligula to Lugdunum Convenarum, in Hispania, a city located on the northern slopes of the Pyrenees, in the territory of the convenes. And there he died, because shortly after Caligula sentenced him to death. Execution of exiles was common. This was the harvest of a man who coveted a kingdom. An ending that seems to link very well with Jesus' question: “What good is it for a man to govern the whole world if he is not capable of governing himself?”

# The royal court 

During the time of Jesus there were two royal dynasties, the Hasmonean (or Maccabean) and the Idumean (or Herodian), who lived in permanent discord and confrontation. The first was always considered by the Jews to be the legitimate lineage to sit on the Jewish throne, while the second, imposed by Rome, and coming from a kingdom, Idumea, to the south of Judea, was always under permanent rejection. Furthermore, these Idumean kings were more influenced by Hellenistic ideas and introduced many customs that provoked the wrath of their subjects.

Jesus' life coincided with two generations of Idumean kings. Already the Hasmonaean race had been deposed, although not exterminated. Until the year 4 BC, the reign of Herod the Great or Herod I, and from then until the end of the life of Jesus, the reign or rather the government of some of his sons, who took charge of regions within their kingdom: Herod Archelaus was ethnarch of Judea, Samaria, and Idumea, Herod Antipas was tetrarch of Galilee and Perea, and Herod Philip was tetrarch of Gaulanitide, Traconite, Auranitide, Batanea, Panias, and Iturea. 

## Court officials

Herod the Great and later his sons provided themselves with a large troop of servants, officials and guards to attend to all their luxurious needs and safeguard their personal integrity, in constant danger for being imposed kings and considered to be of an illegitimate lineage. 

Following the investigations carried out by Joaquín Jeremías, we can list these court servants in order of appearance if we imagine entering the palace of one of these ancient monarchs.

First, we would run into the royal guard. It must have been very numerous, for Herod is said to have sent 500 men of this guard to help the Emperor Augustus, which means that he probably had at least ten times as many and that this detachment did not represent a great depletion in his ranks. On the other hand, it is not conceivable that there were only Jewish soldiers in this guard, because they would not be very reliable for these Idumean kings. From Flavius ​​Josephus we know that the guard was also made up of Thracian, Germanic and Gallic troops. The Gauls, in particular, had previously been in the service of Queen Cleopatra of Egypt, numbering four hundred men. It is very possible that these troops caused fear among the Jews, since these men were little familiar with them. It could have been a detachment of these men who went to arrest John the Baptist sent by Herod's son, Antipas. Alongside these troops were the deadliest of servants, the executioners, busily active in the time of the Idumean monarchs.

Immediately after, we will find them with the porters, in charge of driving the newcomers. Josephus speaks of five hundred servants in the court of Herod I, most of them slaves, but also freedmen and eunuchs (the latter were castrated men who took care of the women in the harem). Among these servants we find chiefs of the chambers (each royal chamber probably had those responsible for ensuring that everything was in order), the royal hunters, under the orders of a hunting chief, the court barbers, the chamber doctors, and all manner of unimaginable servants, such as a royal crown weaver mentioned in the Talmud. Luxury and adornment had no measure in these princely courts, exceeding everything possible for the wealthy class to show superiority and royal dignity.

If we had managed to enter, perhaps thanks to a pass, they would make us wait in the chambers where the royal officials attended. Among these we would find the royal secretary, through whose hands all correspondence passed. We also have the treasurer, a character of fundamental importance and whose name we know from the times of Herod I, called José. He was famous for acquiring a pearl of extraordinary value for the royal treasury, a story that must have inspired the parable of Jesus collected by the evangelist Matthew (Mt 13: 45-46).

Among the closest attendants to the king or ethnarch are the princes' tutors, who also provide conversation and entertainment for the monarchy. They used to be of Hellenistic tendency. The name of two of them in the court of Herod I is mentioned to us: Andrómaco and Gemello. The sons of these preceptors and of the nobility used to be “brothers by milk of the future kings” (_paides basilikoi_), becoming considered with a special rank when their adoptive brothers reached the throne (_syntrophos_). Precisely a _syntrophos_ of Herod Antipas is mentioned in Acts 13:1, called Manaen, and who was a Christian teacher who lived in Antioch. This character, together with a certain Chuza or Cusa, administrator of Herod Antipas (Lk 8:3), husband of Juana, one of the followers of Jesus,

But perhaps the closest of the king's advisers was the so-called _somatophylax_, or officer of the royal chamber, which in the case of Herod I was an Arab syntrophos named Corinth. Three very influential officials are also appointed, who are given seemingly second-rate positions: the butler, the carver, and the waiter. However, in the ancient royal courts, these positions appointed very distinguished personalities. The butler, who had the unique privilege of serving the king the cup, the carver, who in turn had the privilege of chopping and serving the food, and the waiter (who came from the chamber) and who was in charge of all the affairs of the royal chamber. It is even said of the latter that he managed many of the king's businesses.

Once they gave us the go-ahead and we were free to move around the palace, we would find the king and queen in their chambers (in the case of Herod Antipas he did not have the royal dignity, but his position was that of tetrarch), and his close relatives and closest friends. Of Herod I we have enough samples with Nicholas of Damascus, learned and educated man, philosopher and historian of the court, and his brother Ptolemy, as well as another Ptolemy finance minister and chancellor, and Irenaeus, Greek teacher of rhetoric. 

Along with these regular inhabitants of the court there were also frequent guests from other royal houses or high officials of the Roman Empire.

## Kingdoms and main divisions 


## The toparchies 

They were immediate administrative divisions to the kingdoms, ethnarchies or tetrarchies, devised for fiscal purposes. Each of them had a capital city where the chief collectors in charge of collecting taxes would settle. 

From ancient sources we know quite well the arrangement of these toparchies in the time of Jesus, which we can summarize as follows: 

In Judea: 

* In the center: Jerusalem (it was also called Orine, the name of the surrounding mountainous area).
* In the north: Gofna, located on the road that leads from Jerusalem to Neapolis (Siquén), 16 Roman miles north of Jerusalem, present-day Jifna; Acrabatta, further north than Gofna, 9 Roman miles southeast of Neapolis (Shechem), present-day Aqraba. 
* In the northwest: Tamna, which had a tomb where Joshua was believed to be buried and is the current Kirbet Tibneh, 12 km NW of Jifna; Lida (later Diospolis); Jope. 
* To the west: Emmaus or Amaus (later Nicopolis), current Imwas, 16 km SE of Lida, but not the Emmaus of Lk 24:13, which is closer to Jerusalem.; Jamnia. 
* To the southwest: Betletefa, current Beit Nettif. 
* To the south: Idumea, but its capital was Bet Guvrin (later Eleutheropolis), and Bet Guvrin is present-day Beit Jibrim.
* To the southeast: Engadi, on the western shore of the Dead Sea, today's Ain Jidi, famous for its palm groves and balsam plantations; Herodium, important fortress built by Herod the Great in southern Judea, and in which his mausoleum was built, located 60 stadia from Jerusalem, current Jebel el-Fureidis. 
* To the east: Jericho. 

In Perea: 

* Julias, formerly Livias, now Tell er-Rameh, 2.5 km south of K. el-Kefreim. 
* Abila, present-day K. el-Kefreim, 1.5 km SW of el-Kefreim. 
* In the north: Gadara, present-day Tell Jadur, near es-Salt. 
* In the south: Amato, present-day Tell Ammata, a short distance east of the Jordan, 21 Roman miles south of Pella. 

In Galilee:

* To the southeast: Tariquea, which is identified by some with Magdala, current Migdal, but it fits better in the south of the Sea of ​​Galilee, in the ruins of Bet Yeraj. 
* To the northeast: Tiberias, now Tiberias. 
* To the northwest: Sepphoris. 
* Garaba, also Araba (and sometimes misspelled as Gabara), current Arrat al-Battuf. 

## Towns and villages

At the time of Jesus there was a basic distinction between what was considered a city, named 'yr in Aramaic and polis in Greek, and what was considered a village, named hsr or kpr (kefar) in Aramaic and nomo or nomopolis in Greek. (for example, in Mark 1,38). The distinction was not due to physiognomy, nor to the layout of a walled enclosure. It was a status that populations earned over time, and that their rulers granted.

What the village status did entail was a certain dependency on a city, which is called the capital city. It is not clear what this dependency entailed, but it surely meant that there were no judicial elements of their own or any other type of authority, and it was therefore necessary to resort to those in the capital. In some areas (Traconítida) the terms metronomy are used for a village with a certain pre-eminence over several neighboring villages, and metropolis when the capital had the rank of city. Another term used to designate villages with a certain character of cities was nomopolis. 

Therefore, the rank of importance could be listed as follows in increasing order: 

Kefar or Nomo > Metronomia or Nomópolis > Polis or Metropolis

Even above the last category the Jews placed one more category which they called krk in the Mishnah, and which we can translate as “great city”. Possibly they were thinking of Jerusalem, to set it apart from the rest. 

However, all this terminology was used very loosely, so depending on who used it, the same population could sometimes be considered under different categories.

# Roman troops in the time of Jesus 

## Organization of the Roman army

Around the time of Augustus' death the empire had a total of twenty-five legions, numbering approximately 140,000 men. To these had to be added as many belonging to the auxiliary troops and more than 10,000 Praetorians. This raised the contingents to more than 320,000 individuals. 

### regular troops

In the first half of the 1st century -the imperial era-, after the reforms of Augustus and Tiberius, each legion, in general, numbered between 10,000 and 12,000 men (joining regular and auxiliary troops, half each). The regular troops of the legion were divided into ten cohorts, numbered from I to X. A cohort (Latin: cohors) was composed of 3 maniples; each maniple was made up of 2 centuries and a century was 80 men, so each cohort (6 centuries) totaled 480 men. The first cohort (the I), formed by the most seasoned men of the legion, was exceptionally composed of 5 double centuries (centuries of 160 men each), that is, 800 men. Commanding each legion was a commander (legate), 7 officers (a camp prefect and six tribunes,

The centuries were divided into 10 contubernios (in Latin: contubernium) of 8 men each (the minimum unit of the Roman army). Each conspiracy was housed in a 6-seater tent or cubicle. The fourth part of it was always on duty. 

Every century was commanded by the centurion, who was assisted by an optio or lieutenant and by a tesserarius or security non-commissioned officer. He had a banner or signum which was carried by a signifer. The centurions of the double centuries of the 1st cohort were called primi ordinis, except for the first century, who was called the primus pilus, and was the most senior centurion in the legion, a career soldier and adviser to the legate. In the rest of the cohorts, the centurion that leads each cohort is called the centurion pilus prior.

With Augustus, the traditional infantry was joined again by the cavalry -recovering lost prestige- and a contingent of auxiliary troops. In each legion, the cavalry appeared to be made up of 480 horsemen, divided into turmae, squads of 30/32 men each led by a decurion (Latin: “leader of ten”), a title derived from the republican cavalry prior to the outbreak of the war. Social War, divided into turmae and led by three decurions each. However, in the time of Jesus the title of decurion was kept, but now they led about thirty horsemen.

On the other hand, since the time of Julius Caesar, the legions included a fairly complete artillery train: each century was equipped with a carroballista, a large crossbow mounted on a chariot, and each cohort with a catapult, which not only increased the legion's firepower in open-field combat, but also served for siege warfare. 

In principle, it was an essential requirement to have Roman citizenship in order to be a regular legionnaire. 

### Auxiliary Troops

The auxiliary troops are small detachments that used to accompany a legion exercising an auxiliary function -in all senses of the word-, but that could also act independently. Their main characteristic is that, with few exceptions, they are made up of individuals who are not Roman citizens, and there are basically two types of units, traditionally associated with cavalry and infantry, which are called wing and cohors, respectively. A separate case would be the equitatae cohorts, made up of a strong nucleus of infantry and a small cavalry detachment.

During the first years of his reign, Augustus created the auxilia corps inspired by the Latin forces used by the Republic before the outbreak of the Social War. The auxilia, conceived as a body of non-citizen troops parallel to the legions, had a fundamental difference with respect to the auxiliaries employed by the republicans: in times of the Republic, the auxiliary corps were made up of mere recruits who had been enlisted for a specific campaign, and that they were dissolved once the campaign in which they served ended; under the reign of Augustus this corps was entirely made up of professional volunteers serving in permanent units.

Augustus organized the auxilia into regiments of the same size as regular cohorts because he considered that the fewer troops that made up a unit, the more flexible it was. 

The auxiliary cohorts, like the regular ones, could be quinquinariae or miliariae, that is, between five hundred and a thousand infantrymen. The quinquinariae cohorts would be made up of six centuries of 80 men – led by a centurion – and the miliariae by ten, which gives us figures of 480 and 800 men, respectively. 

As for the alae, the miliariae would be formed by twenty-four turmae of 30 horsemen -to which must be added a decurion and a standard bearer, in total, 32- and the quinquinariae by sixteen turmae, with total figures of 768 and 512 equites.

The cohors equitata was formed by a contingent of infantry to which was added four turmae of cavalry. 

At the total level, the auxiliary regiments were led by a praefectus who could be: 

* Un noble nativo al que se concedía la ciudadanía romana. Un ejemplo lo hallamos en el cacique germano Arminio, que actuó como prefecto auxiliar antes de rebelarse contra Roma.
* A Roman who could be a member of the ordo equester or a high-ranking centurion. 

The first of the centurions or decurions receives the title of princes and occupies a lower rank than the sub-prefect, assistant to the officer in command of the unit.

At the beginning of the reign of Augustus, the core of the auxiliary troops in the West was made up of warriors drawn from the warlike Gallic tribes (especially those residing in Gallia Belgica, which then included the provinces of Germania Superior and Inferior) and from Illyria. . At the end of the Cantabrian Wars (19 BC), the Empire annexed the provinces of Hispania and Lusitania, territories that soon became great sources of recruitment. In the next few years, Augustus would conquer the regions of Rhetia (15 BC), Noricum (16 BC), Pannonia (9 BC) and Mesia (6), territories that together with Illyria would become the Empire's main source of auxiliary recruits. In the East, where the Syrians supplied Rome with most of the archers in her army, Augustus annexed the provinces of Galatia (25 BC) and Judea (6); the first of these, a region of Anatolia whose name derived from the massive migrations that the Gauls had made there centuries before, also became an important source of recruits. For its part, the light cavalry was supplied from the provinces of Africa, where the regions of Egypt (30 BC), Cyrenaica and Numidia (25 BC) were annexed. The Mauri people, who inhabited the province of Numidia, constituted the main body of the contingents of light cavalry sent to Italy to serve in the legions and assist them. The province of Mauritania, conquered during the reign of Emperor Claudius, would also become an important source of recruits. a region of Anatolia whose name derived from the massive migrations that the Gauls had made there centuries ago, also became an important source of recruits.

The province of Mauritania, conquered during the reign of Emperor Claudius, would also become an important source of recruits.

The rapid conquests made during the reign of Augustus caused an increase in the number of recruits, both in the legions and in the auxilia. In the year 23 there were already the same number of auxiliary soldiers as legionnaires, which means that for the 25 existing legions at the time (140,000 legionnaires) about 250 auxiliary regiments had been recruited.

It remains to mention the singular fact of the Civium Romanorum cohorts, also auxiliary, but made up either of Roman citizens -freedmen who could not enlist in the legions and who would have been recruited in emergency situations-, or of peregrini (inhabitants of the empire who did not had Roman citizenship) who would receive the title as a prize for an outstanding act of arms. The title would henceforth be retained by the unit, despite the discharge of the award-winning troops (auxiliaries were discharged with honors after 25 years of service), and would be under the command of a tribune. 

### irregular troops

As far as the numerus is concerned, in principle it designates any unit that does not adhere to the regularity of those mentioned above, as may be the case of the bodyguards of officers or administrative positions, but in the way in which the numeri achieve greater success is as auxiliary units, although they would differ from the previous ones by their internal organization. Thus, the numeri are what the auxiliary corps were originally: units of recruited natives that maintain their own hierarchical and organizational structure. They are, so to speak, a body of irregulars. It seems that its development since the 2nd century would alleviate the lack of weapons and traditional combat modes that occurred with the gradual romanization of the auxiliary combat mode. 

### Civilian Staff

This small army, capable of fighting on its own in almost any military modality, dragged along (especially in the imperial era) a large number of civilian personnel not directly related to the legion: merchants, prostitutes, “wives” of legionnaires (who could not get married), which by establishing themselves around the permanent or semi-permanent camps ended up giving rise to authentic cities. 

## Existing legions at the time of Jesus 

Augustus, Mark Antony, and Lepidus formed a second triumvirate in 43 BC. Each of them organized their own legions, but when Augustus seizes the absolute power of Rome and his empire after the defeat of Marco Antonio in the battle of Actium (31 BC), he finds himself with 50 legions under the command of the.

Augusto then decides to reorganize the army and make it professional. It dissolves some legions, and others merges them into one, reducing the number to 28. Most of these last more than two centuries, and some like the V Macedonica would still be found in the 6th century AD 

The list of legions and their location during Tiberius' reign was this: 

* on the northern border with Germania: I Germanica, V Alaudae, XX Valeria Victrix, XXI Rapax. 
* on the southern border with Germania: II Augusta, XIII Gemina Pia Fidelis, XIV Gemina Martia Victrix, XVI Gallica. 
* in Numidia: III Augusta Pia Fidelis. 
* in Egypt: III Cyrenaica, XXII Deiotariana. 
* in Pannonia, on the border with Dacia: VIII Augusta, IX Hispana, XV Apollinaris.
* en Moesia, Macedonia y Tracia, en la frontera sur con Dacia: IV Scythia, V Macedonian. 
* en Spain: IV Macedonian, VI Victorious, X Gemini of Equestrian. 
en Siria: III Gallic, VI Ferrata Fidelis, X Fretensis, XII Fulminata. 
* VII Macedonian; 11

As you can see, there are legions with duplicate numbers, this is because some kept their original numbers. The XVII, XVIII, and XIX legions were wiped out in AD 9 in the Teutoburg Forest before getting a name. It was the greatest military disaster of the time, in which his general, Publius Quintillus Varus, lost his life (who, curiously, was the suffocator of the Jewish revolt that occurred after the death of Herod the Great). Their numbers were never used again. The VII and XI legions were renamed Claudia Pia Fidelis in AD 42, but what name the XI previously had is unknown. 

With the loss of three legions in AD 9, the number dropped to 25 and Rome did not return to 28 until AD 66 

## Training

The training fulfilled two functions: to strengthen the body and to teach the techniques of individual combat and formations. 

The marches were a very important part due to their tactical importance, the faster you march the sooner you go into combat. Marches were held regularly regardless of the weather. All the soldiers were loaded with equipment weighing about 25 kg and covered a distance of 30 km in five hours. 

The legionnaires also learned to build camps where they could spend the night after marching days. 

Another part of the training was, without a doubt, the learning of the formations, since it was these that differentiated a Roman legion from a group of barbarians. The legionnaires knew how to execute line relays, turtle formations and displays of all kinds.

The legionnaires exercised with false weighted weapons, so that normal weapons would be lighter. 

Finally, we must talk about discipline. Legionnaires were taught to blindly obey orders, and those who disobeyed were seriously punished by lynching, stoning or tithes, which were executed by their companions. 

## Roman Soldier Equipment

They all appeared dressed in the campaign “uniform”: braided coats made of iron mesh that protected the body up to the middle of the thigh, resting on a leather doublet of identical dimensions. And all this over the characteristic short-sleeved red tunic. The helmets, without visors, worked with a sober elegance, shimmered in the incipient morning sun. The rigid discipline kept the buculae or bronze cheek pieces fastened below the chin. And following an old tradition -generally practiced in combat-, each of the soldiers wore a striking plume on their crest, made up of three red feathers one cubit high (almost half a meter). The presence of these ornaments was fundamentally due to a psychological reason. Although the minimum size to be recruited into the legion (at least in the main cohorts) was 1.72 meters (1) both in battle and on guard duty, those extra two feet gave them an imposing appearance, destined to impress the enemy. A wide leather belt, lined with nail heads, completed the outfit. The inseparable gladius hung on the right side. One of the sentinels also had several iron strips that fell from the center of the belt, protecting the lower abdomen. The fearsome caligas, finally, the strap sandals, with the soles bristling with nails, brought back distant and painful memories. And at a short distance, forming a “pyramid”, the oval and garnet shields. And leaning against the wall, the two meter long pilum or pikes,

The candidate for the legion was subjected to a rigorous medical and psychological examination. If any physical defect weighed on him or a moral or mental flaw or if he did not give the minimum size, he was repudiated. If they declared it probabilis, it was carved (incumare), being assigned to a cohort. And each new “recruit” received a lead plaque, with his identity, which he was required to hang around his neck. 

## Military life and promotions 

Within a legion, a man started as a simple foot soldier (thousands), after several years of service and for soldiers with trade, the first promotion was from thousands to immuns; although he had the same salary, he exempted them from the general routines of the other soldiers.

But the first real promotion turned the soldier into a principal, of whom there were two classes: those who received pay and a half (sesquiplicarii) and those who received double pay (duplicarii). The first group included various types of non-commissioned officers, such as the tesserarius (orderly). Among the latter were the standard bearers (signiferi and vexillarii), the optiones and other officers. The next grade was that of centurion, where the oldest and most experienced (primi ordines) were part of the first cohort, and the oldest of them (primus pilus) had the right to attend the councils of war. 

## Symbols

From the reform of Mario - around the year 104 a. C.-, one of the traditional banners that these corps used to take to the battlefield has been prioritized within the legion. It is the Roman eagle, which prevails as the legionary symbol par excellence, displacing the wolf, the bull, the wild boar and the horse, samples of totem animals belonging to a peasant society. The eagles are made of noble metals - silver first, gold later - and are jealously guarded in the “aedes signorum” or sanctuary of the camp. The loss of the eagles, as happened to Crassus or Mark Antony in the East or Varus among the Germans, is the greatest dishonor a legionary corps can suffer. The non-commissioned officer in charge of the eagle was the “aquilifer”.

Furthermore, there are other types of banners, such as the “signa”, “imagines”, “vexilla” or “dracones”: 

* The “signum” is the banner of each century: finished off in the form of a pole or hand – in memory of the ancient maniple-, and below an inscription with the name of the cohort, it was decorated with garlands, crescents and disks. The number of disks (philarae), from one to ten, marked the number of the century within the cohort. 
* The “images”, exclusive to the imperial legions, are heads of Caesar in the form of busts, made of gold or silver, placed on top of the standard, and showing who the Caesar who had formed the legion was.
* For its part, the “vexillum” is the flag that marks the general's position on the battlefield, but it is also the ensign of the irregular detachments, which is why they are called “vexillationes”. They hang from a crossbar to the flagpole. They had a square shape and a red background, and on it were the initials of the legion and cohort, as well as sometimes the representation of an eagle, of the goddess Victoria, or of Caesar. 
* The “draco” is a bronze animal head with open jaws, to which a tube of colored fabric is added and when shaken it produces a dull noise. 

The bearers of these ensigns were, respectively, the “signiferes”, “imaginiferes”, “vexillarii” and “draconarii”.

The cult of the banners was carried out on a permanent basis by means of deposition in the “aedes”. However, there are special occasions when the “signa” and “vexilla” (Rosalia Signorum), the legionary eagles (natalis aquilae, Honos Aquilae) are honored. 

## Decorations 

The decorations of the republican period consisted of crowns, having them of various types: 

* Gramineous crown: it was awarded for saving an army. 
* Civic crown: it was granted for saving the life of a companion, it was made of oak leaves. 
* Corona muralis: it was awarded to the first to crown the enemy wall. 
* Corona vallaris: it was granted to the first one that assaulted the enemy trench. 
* Corona navalis: rewarded the capture of a ship.
* In imperial times the phalerae, the armillae and the torcs were added. 
* High-ranking soldiers could also get decorations: 
	* Chief centurion and subordinate tribunes could get a silver spear. 
	* Chief Tribune could get 2 gold crowns, 2 silver spears and 2 small gold banners. 
	* Legacies could earn up to three sets of awards. 
	* The consuls and governors could get 4 games. 
	* However, the highest decoration was not a medal or crown but a Triumph. 

## Roman detachments in Palestine

In the time of Jesus, four of the legions - the VI Ferrata, the X Fretensis, the XII Fulminata and the III Gallica - were concentrated in neighboring Syria, a strategic point in the eastern region of the empire, watching over the Parthians and, therefore, Of course, to the Jewish rioters. 

However, in the province of Judea (as the Palestinian nation was known in Rome), there were no regular troops or legions stationed there during Jesus' lifetime. The existing troops were made up of auxiliary troops under the direct command of the prefect on duty. The troops were recruited directly from the local non-Israelite population, that is, Gentiles.

According to Flavio Josefo, the existing troops in the province were a cavalry alae and five auxiliary cohorts, all of the quingenarian type (500 to 600 men) adding a total of about 3,000 troops. They were under the orders of Archelaus but were acquired by the subsequent prefects. 

Cohorts and alae were named after the various ethnic groups from which they had been recruited. In Palestine and Syria these were some of their names: 

* Cohors Ascolonitarum: In Ashkelon, which at least in early times was part of an imperial estate, there was a cohort and a wing. 
* Cohors Canathenorum, located in Canatá, current El-Qanawat, and which at the time of Jesus was part of the Decapolis. 
* Cohors Damascenorum, in Damascus, outside the territory of Judea.
* Cohors Ituraeorum, of the equitatae type. There is no security, but this could perhaps be the one established in Capernaum. 
* Cohors I Sebastenorum, also called the Cohors Augusta Sebastenorum, stationed at Caesarea Maritima, and made up of inhabitants of Sebaste and Caesarea. 
* Wing I Sebastenorum, cavalry wing that accompanied the previous cohort. 
* Cohors Tyriorum, at Tyre, outside the territory of Judea.

In addition to Caesarea, there were also small garrisons in other cities and towns in Palestine. There were fortified places in Jericho and Maqueron. Several detachments were distributed throughout Samaria; on the Great Plain there was another under the command of a decurion; in Ashkelon there was a cohort and a wing. In Jerusalem there was a cohort under the command of a tribune (called chiliarch in the New Testament) and they occupied the Antonia fortress, the most impregnable, located to the north of the temple, and with two sets of stairs (chatabareis) that descended from the fortress to the atrium of the temple in order to control the crowds. On major festivals guards were posted in the arcades surrounding the temple courts. Acts 2323 also indicates that a cavalry detachment was quartered with the Jerusalem cohort, so it must be considered that it was a cohors equitatae. These units could be formed by Greeks, Thracians, Samaritans, Syrians, Gauls, Germanic and Spanish, who were already under the command of Herod the Great.

It may be a mistake to consider that the so-called Cohors I Itálica civium Romanorum, from which several inscriptions have come down to us, was stationed in Judea during the time of Jesus. It was formed by troops originally from Italy and from the inscriptions it is deduced that it was in Judea and Syria from the year 69 AD onwards, but not before. 

The prefect used to surround himself with a council of committees, officials of high position who were in his courtship or young people who accompanied the governor with the aim of learning. Not only did they help him in the exercise of his ministry, but they also assisted him in fulfilling other duties, acting as his consilium. In certain cases, dignitaries from the native population had a say in the deliberations of the consilium. 

## The Roman garrison of Capernaum

Contrary to what happened with other important nuclei, the Roman garrison of Nahum was not outside the city. It was not a 'camp' in the style of traditional Roman military fortifications. Nor did the troops stay in the houses of civilians, following the custom that they called hospitium militare and that Justinian's code later called metata. In this case, from the time of Pompey's conquest, the invaders limited themselves to requisitioning one of the existing properties next to the road or via Maris, reforming it and turning it into a barracks of regular dimensions, sufficient for the equitatae cohort, called Cohors Ituraeorum, destined there. A cohort “officially” under the tutelage of Tetrarch Antipas, but really only on an honorary basis.

It was an equitatae cohort of the quingenarian type, which had six centuries of 80 men, who together with the ten centurions who commanded them, formed a total of about five hundred men. Joining them were four cavalry turmae, totaling 130 cavalry, under the command of four decurions. In total, those 630 men obeyed Pontius and his natural bosses, the tribune and officers of the most veteran unit: the I Sebastenorum cohort, based in Caesarea. 

La tropa se componía de habitantes de Iturea, hombres montaraces y rudos acostumbrados a la vida en las pendientes del monte Líbano, al norte de Galilea, de donde provenían. La cohorte disponía de un nutrido cuerpo de auxiliares sagittarii, infantes expertos en el manejo del arco, especialmente del arco compuesto. Los itureos fueron famosos por su destreza con el arco, y el arco compuesto, el que tiene la forma de una B, era el más utilizado en el Oriente. Eran arcos complejos de fabricar, se podía tardar un año para hacer uno, formados por varios materiales (madera y asta de búfalo o cabra) en láminas que les daban una resisencia y elasticidad únicas. Un arco simple puede lanzar flechas a una distancia media de 175-200 m, mientras que el arco compuesto llega a 300 m.

The barracks, with its five-meter-high walls, solidly built of the abundant black basalt stone of the region, was unmistakable. In the center of the facade was a huge iron gate, usually wide open from sunrise to sunset.

The barracks, rough and austere, offered at that point the sleeping area. Around an open-air quadrangular patio, about sixty meters on each side, stood three identical buildings with two floors each. The wall he had just crossed enclosed the square. And all, of course, built with Nahum's generous basalt. Judging by the layout and the number of doors of the triple wing I deduced, as I say, which troops.

In the center of said patio, exquisitely cobbled with light and jet volcanic stones, worn by the years and damp and shiny by the morning washdown, stretched four veteran date palms twenty meters high. The green of the curved leaves and the sunny cinnamon of the flower clusters precariously brightened the enclosure, mourned by the basaltic blocks. A no less ancient well, armed with a metallic tripod, practically captive among the Phoenix dactylifera, completed the Spartan picture.

On the ground floor of the central wing, at the end of a narrow tunnel, one could make out an esplanade of dirty, beaten earth, closed off at the end by wooden barracks. A few soldiers, dressed only in light red tunics, tended half a dozen horses, brushing them or walking them with the help of the halter.

# The Roman troops in Jewish territory 

To document myself about the Roman troops in the Palestine of Jesus, I have read _History of the Jewish people_, by Emil Schurer, and I have been able to collect these data:

In the time of Jesus, four of the legions (the VI Ferrata, the X Fretensis, the XII Fulminata and the III Gallica) were concentrated in neighboring Syria, a strategic point in the eastern region of the empire, watching over the Parthians and, therefore, Of course, to the Jewish rioters. 

However, during Jesus' lifetime there were no regular troops or legions stationed in Judea. The existing troops were made up of auxiliary troops under the direct command of the prefect on duty. The troops were recruited directly from the local non-Israelite population, that is, Gentiles.

According to Flavio Josefo, the existing troops in the province were a cavalry alae and five auxiliary cohorts, all of the quingenarian type (500 to 600 men) adding a total of about 3,000 troops. They were under the orders of Archelaus but were acquired by the subsequent prefects. 

Cohorts and alae were named after the various ethnic groups from which they had been recruited. In Palestine and Syria these were some of their names: 

* _Cohors Ascolonitarum_: In Ashkelon, which at least in early times was part of an imperial estate, there was a cohort and a wing. 
* _Cohors Canathenorum_, located in Canatá, current El-Qanawat, and which at the time of Jesus was part of the Decapolis. 
* _Cohors Damascenorum_, in Damascus, outside the territory of Judea.
* _Cohors Ituraeorum_, of type _equitatae_. Could it have been the one established in Capernaum? 
* _Cohors I Sebastenorum_, also called the _Cohors Augusta Sebastenorum_, stationed at Caesarea Maritima, and made up of inhabitants of Sebaste and Caesarea. 
* _Ala I Sebastenorum_, cavalry wing that accompanied the previous cohort. 
* _Cohors Tyriorum_, at Tyre, outside the territory of Judea.

In addition to these, there were also small garrisons in other cities and towns in Palestine. There were fortified places in Jericho and Macheronte; several detachments were distributed throughout Samaria; on the Great Plain there was another under the command of a decurion; in Ashkelon there was a cohort and a wing. In Jerusalem there was a cohort under the command of a tribune (called in the New Testament _chiliarca_) and they occupied the Antonia fortress, the most impregnable, located to the north of the temple, and with two sets of stairs (_chatabareis_) that descended from the fortress to the atrium of the temple in order to control the crowds. On major festivals guards were posted in the arcades surrounding the temple courts. In Acts 23: 23 also indicates that a cavalry detachment was quartered with the Jerusalem cohort, so it must be considered that it was a cohors equitatae. There is also talk of the existence of a _Cohors I Itálica civium Romanorum_, of which several inscriptions have come down to us, but it may be an error to consider that it was stationed in Judea during the time of Jesus. It was formed by troops originally from Italy and from the inscriptions it is deduced that it was in Judea and Syria from the year 69 AD onwards, but not before.

These units could be formed by Greeks, Thracians, Samaritans, Syrians, Gauls, Germanic and Spanish, who were already under the command of Herod the Great. 

In my opinion, the Capernaum garrison may well have been the equitatae cohort called _Cohors Ituraeorum_. A cohort “officially” under the tutelage of Tetrarch Antipas, but really only on an honorary basis.

It would be an equitatae cohort of the quingenarian type, with six centuries of 80 men, who together with the ten centurions who commanded them, formed a total of about five hundred men. Along with them he would have four cavalry _turmae_, totaling 130 horsemen, under the command of four decurions. The control of those 630 men would ultimately be in the hands of Pontius and the tribune and officers of the most veteran unit: the _cohort I Sebastenorum_, based in Caesarea.

The troop would be made up of inhabitants of Iturea, wild and rude men accustomed to life on the slopes of Mount Lebanon, north of Galilee, where they would come from. The cohort would have a large body of auxiliaries _sagittarii_, expert infants in handling the bow, especially the compound bow. The Itureos were famous for their skill with the bow, and the compound bow, the one shaped like a B, was the most widely used in the East. They were complex bows to manufacture, it could take a year to make one, formed by various materials (wood and buffalo or goat horn) in sheets that gave them a unique resistance and elasticity. A simple bow can shoot arrows at an average distance of 175-200 m, while the compound bow reaches 300 m.

With all these data it is with which this section of the disturbances caused by the arrival of Pontius Pilate and the consequent records in the populations of the Sea of ​​Galilee has been fictionalized.

**SOCIEDAD** 

# The Jewish authorities in the time of Jesus 

At the head of the Jewish people in the time of Jesus was a trio of forces that together formed the ruling class: 1) a priestly nobility, or clergy, who constituted the religious authority; 2) a lay nobility, or elders, who constituted a lay authority; and finally, 3) the scribes, the sapiential authority. We will proceed to account for each of these groups. 

## The clergy

The importance of the Jewish clergy of the time of Jesus lies in the tremendous theocracy in which the Jewish society of that time lived submerged. Firstly, the clergy is the Jewish nobility of the time, and secondly, it was the religious, political and legal authority of the Jewish people. 

We can classify the clergy in the following degrees: 

- a) the high priest (_kôhen gadôl_; pl. _kôhanîm gadôlîm_), 
- b) the chief priests, made up of: 
	* the supreme head of the temple or simply, head of the temple (_sâgan ha -kôhanîm_),

	* the chiefs of the daily shift of priests (_rôs bet'ab_), who were about 156, since each of the 24 weekly sections had from 4 to 9 daily shifts. They were also in charge of matters of worship,

We now go into detail about each position in the hierarchy. 

## The High Priest

In the time when there was no king, in Judea the most important and authoritative member of the people was the high priest, called _kôhen gadôl_. He gathered to himself all authority in any matter related to the nation. 

The most important privilege, however, was religious. The high priest was the only mortal who could enter the Holy of Holies one day a year, the day of atonement. On that day, the slightest breach of liturgical norms would have brought judgment from God, and so the high priest performed his duties on that particular day, and on all other important days, with extreme care and scrupulosity. 

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="/image/220px-PLATE4DX.jpg"></figure>
<em>High priest and Levite in ancient Judah. The representations of the Menorah, the table of loaves and the trumpets are inspired by the arch of Titus http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PLATE4DX.jpg</em> 

He had another long series of religious privileges: to be able to make the offering of a sacrifice whenever he wanted; that of being able to make a sacrifice even while in mourning, something totally forbidden to the rest of the priests; in the distribution of the sacred things of the temple among the priests he had the right to choose first what he wanted; he is the one who presided over the Sanhedrin or great council, which was the supreme legislative and judicial authority of the Jews; and in case of a crime, the high priest had only to submit to the great council.

The high priest, however, also had duties and obligations, almost all of a purely religious nature: according to the law his duties were limited to officiating on the day of atonement, but custom had added others: participating in the ceremony of burning a red heifer and prepare during the week before the day of atonement; also to officiate on Saturdays, the new moon festivals, and the three pilgrimage festivals (Passover-_massot_, Pentecost and the Tabernacles), as well as in the town assemblies; he also paid a food offering every day in the morning and evening. Regarding financial obligations, he was obliged to pay a bull that was immolated as an expiatory sacrifice on the feast of expiation,

Other obligations contracted by the high priest referred to prescriptions about ritual purity. At that time the causes of an impurity that prevented the high priest from exercising his position reached the maximum absurd: contact with a corpse, having messy hair and having some rip or tear in the clothes. The fact that a high priest could not officiate was so serious that the prohibitions in this matter, unlike the rest of the priests, were extremely rigorous: he could not have contact with any corpse, not even those of his own family, and to avoid this he was not allowed to walk even behind the coffin (it can be assumed that it was practically impossible for a high priest to attend a funeral);

As a curiosity, at the time of Jesus the priests discussed a lot about a question that had already arisen some time with some high priest: the question of the “dead man of the commandment”, which was the dead man who had no family when he died, and According to Jewish law, whoever found his body was obliged to bury him. The absurdity in these discussions reached such an extreme at that time that the Sadducees maintained that this case was excepted for the high priest, while the Pharisees, paradoxically placing mercy above ritual observations, also admitted it for the high priest. leader.

Another one of the prescriptions that tried to safeguard the aptitude of the high priest for the accomplishment of the cult were the severe questions about the marriage. The high priest, like any Jewish priest, married. Not doing so was frowned upon since the priesthood was hereditary. However, if it was discovered that his wife was not a virgin, the marriage made her legally incapable of exercising his position. She was considered a non-virgin woman to the widow, the divorced, the raped and the prostitute. And it went so far as to say that he could not marry a woman who had been a prisoner of war (because it was not clear that she had not been raped by the enemy). This law, however, was repeatedly disregarded by various high priests of the time of Jesus, which caused the evident indignation of the most puritanical circles of the nation (the Pharisees). But it is that the high priest's marriage prescriptions were such that they almost made it impossible for him to marry. At that time, after several wars under Herod, practically every woman was suspected of having been a prisoner of war.

What happened when a priest contracted impurity that prevented him from performing the rite? Another priest was chosen to replace him. And this priest, although high priest for one day only, was placed in the lists of high priests along with all the others. This happened in the time of Jesus several times. In 5 BC the high priest Matthias was replaced by a certain Joseph ben Ellem; Simeon was replaced by a priest in 17 AD And there were other cases.

We must point out, in closing, that the high priest kept his title even after he had been deposed. The position, naturally, passed to another, but continued to have weight and importance in the group of priests. Hence the explanation of the importance of Annas, the father-in-law of the acting high priest, Caiaphas, in the condemnation of Jesus. Annas held the office of high priest from AD 6 to 15, and Caiaphas from AD 18 to 37 

## The chief priests

The chief priests, called in Hebrew _kôhanîm gadolîm_, and in Greek _archiereis_ (singular _archiereus_) and also _archontes_, formed a group of distinguished priests who were in charge of different matters related to the temple. They formed a group with a certain degree of independence, probably all with a seat in the Sanhedrin, and with a social category in a higher link than the rest of the clergy, which did not stop provoking internal rivalries. There were several types of positions that we are going to examine in order of hierarchical importance. 

### The head of the temple or _sagan_

After the high priest, the highest ranking priest was the supreme head of the temple, called _sagan ha-kôhanîm_ and also _strategos_ and _tou hierou_. His position, like the previous one, was one of those that were claimed by the temple cult all year round, required his continuous presence in Jerusalem, and had only one holder. At the time Jesus was crucified, it seems fitting that this position was held by Jonathan, son of Annas, the former high priest (who is mentioned in Acts 4:5-6). Jonathan succeeded Caiaphas as high priest in 37 AD

The importance of this position lies in the fact that in solemn ceremonies he assisted the high priest, occupying the position of honor to his right; he had to see that the high priest performed the rites correctly; he used to be the substitute for the high priest on the day of atonement in case the high priest could not perform his function; and normally, who was appointed high priest is because he had previously been head of the temple. 

In addition to the supervision of the cult, the head of the temple had in his hands the supreme police authority. By virtue of it he carried out arrests, and his power in political matters was therefore considerable. 

### Heads of Sections

The head of the temple was followed in rank by the heads of the weekly sections of priests (_rôs ha-mismar_), which were 24, since there were 24 weeks in the liturgical calendar, and the heads of the daily shifts (_rôs bet'ab_), who there were about 156, because in each weekly section there were several shifts, from 4 to 9.

These chief priests lived scattered throughout Judea and Galilee; Except for the three annual pilgrimage festivals, they were only present in Jerusalem to perform the cultic sacrifices one out of every 24 weeks, when it was their section's duty to be on duty. During this week they had to perform certain functions of the daily cult. During this week, the priest in charge of the section carried out the purification ceremonies for lepers and puerperal women who had finished their purification period and were waiting at the Nicanor gate to be declared pure. It was precisely one of these priests who received Mary, Joseph and the child Jesus at the door of Nicanor after the forty days of Mary's purification were completed, and that is where Simeon the singer sang the hymn that Ana composed for them, the poetess (Lk 2:

The head of the priests of the daily shift, for his part, the day he officiated his shift, had to attend the sacrifices. In any case, the real direction of the daily worship was carried out by the head of the temple and a subordinate called “the one in charge of the lottery”. 

### Guardians of the temple or _'ammarkalîn_

The guardians of the temple, called _'ammarkalîn_ and also _strategoi_, were in charge of the doors of the temple and that the sanctuary was guarded. They were the chief guards of the huge temple building. There were to be at least seven, one for each gate of the inner court. This inner court, a small space within the great temple esplanade, was reserved for Jews only, and no foreign gentile could enter under pain of death. This fact was often used for abuses such as the tumult that arose when Paul visited the temple (Acts 21:28). Both for the accesses to the esplanade and to the sacred inner court there were guards and porters directed by this body of _'ammarkalîn_. The important positions in these vigilances fell to priests, and minor police duties were left to Levites. The Mishnah states that during the night the Levites acted as watchmen at twenty-one points in the temple and the priests at three. Some of these Levitical guards were stationed at the gates and corners of the outer court (inside) and others at the gates and corners of the inner court (outside). Guardian priests guarded the inner court.

A temple captain stood guard at night to make sure all sentinels were awake. This captain of the temple was given the name of _'ys hr hbyt_, and he was in charge of the esplanade. There must have been another in charge of the Sanctuary itself, who was called _'ys hbyrh_.

These security guards were also responsible for opening and closing the heavy doors, which were kept locked at night. There was an officer in charge of supervising the closing of the doors, some so heavy that they required the work of no less than twenty men, and which made considerable noise when they were turned. The keys were in the custody of the elders of the priestly shifts in charge of guarding the atrium. When shifts changed, the priests handed over the keys to those who came on duty. As the first morning sacrifice was offered at sunrise, the gates had to be opened before then. Only during Easter they remained open until midnight. 

### Treasurers or _gizbarîm_

The treasurers, called _gizbarîm_, came after the temple guards. They were three. They were in charge of the finances of the temple, which included real estate, treasures, jewels, tributes, offerings, as well as private capital deposited in the temple. Its activities were aimed at facilitating the acquisition of articles and products necessary for worship, the control and sale of birds and other articles for sacrifices, and the care of keeping in good condition and repairing the gold and silver utensils necessary for worship. daily worship.

The Jerusalem temple, in this sense, like many temples of the time, functioned as a large bank. The riches were kept inside in isolated chambers in the inner court, and all entries and exits were meticulously recorded in rolls or account books. The treasurers were in charge of keeping all these records and making the collections. They were paid everything that was imputed: the equivalent of the objects offered to the temple, which could be in cash, the anathemas (donations to the temple that could not be in cash), other things consecrated to the temple, the second tithe, which used to be money, and anything else financial.

It was, therefore, the income of the temple that the treasurers had to manage mainly. They received the wheat offered to the temple; they were paid the equivalent of the wheat, agricultural products and pasta offered; they determined the use of objects donated to the temple; and they were in charge of the temple tax, those two drachmas that every Israelite had to pay annually. In addition to the income of the temple, the treasurers also managed its expenses. They bought the firewood, examined the wine for the libations and the flour for the two loaves of firstfruits that were baked on the Pentecost feast. Finally, part of his task was the administration of the temple's reserves and its treasury. 

## The priests

The simple priests, called _kôhen hedyôt_, were the great mass of existing priests scattered throughout the geography of Palestine.

The priests were organized into priestly classes. In the time of Jesus there were 24 priestly classes, whose roots went back to the distant past and whose transmission was carried out in a hereditary way. For this reason, each priestly class was usually assigned a liturgical week, and the priestly classes were also called weekly sections. The 24 classes comprised all the priests scattered throughout Judea and Galilee. Each class consisted of 4 to 9 families of priests, called sections or daily shifts, because they were the ones that officiated in turns during the seven days of the week that their weekly section was on duty. We have already seen how a chief priest, the _rôs ha-mismar_, was in charge of a weekly section, and another, the _rôs bet'ab_, was in charge of each daily section.

The total number of priests to officiate on every day of the year is considerable. They were, by way of estimation, about 7,200. The number cannot be exact because each weekly section had a variable number of daily shifts, between 4 to 9. To these, it will be necessary to add later the considerable number of existing Levites.

Every 24 weeks, and also on the three annual pilgrimage festivals, the entire weekly section of priests, consisting of an average of 300 priests and 400 Levites, and to which was added a group of lay representatives from their district, went up to Jerusalem to perform the service, from one Saturday to another Saturday. The section relieved by her solemnly handed over the keys to the temple and the sacrificial utensils. Thus, in the last years of Herod's reign, the eighth-ranked weekly section of Abiya moved from the Judean mountain to the temple. The priest Zechariah, on the day his daily section was on duty, had been appointed, according to Luke's account (Lk 1: 5-25), for the privileged function of offering the sacrifice of perfumes, probably at the hour of the evening sacrifice, called _tamîd_. And it is supposedly here that an angel appears to him.

The cultic functions of the priests were practically limited to two weeks per year, in addition to the three annual pilgrimage festivals. The priests lived ten or eleven months a year in their houses. There they very rarely had to exercise a priestly activity. An example of his duties was to declare a leper clean after his healing, before he went to Jerusalem, and there, after a sacrifice, to be declared fully clean. 

The tithes and other particular tributes constituted the income of the priests; but they were totally insufficient to allow them to spend the whole year in idleness. On the contrary, the priests were forced to exercise a profession in the place where they resided, usually a manual trade.

In many places there were priests who had a function in the courts of law, but most of the time, no doubt, on an honorary basis and without remuneration. Sometimes they were called in consideration of their priestly status; others because of their scribal training, insofar as they possessed it; sometimes, finally, to fulfill the biblical precept. 

Along with country priests provided with a deep scriptural training, who were most often entrusted with the synagogue service, the reading and explanation of the law, there were also others who were very uneducated. It was not a requirement to be a priest to have a certain degree of training. Many scribes, or _rabbis_, had much higher training than priests, and were not part of the clergy. 

## The Levites

The Levites constituted the lower clergy. Their name comes from Levi, one of the tribes of Israel, from which they had to be descended, just as the legitimate high priests were descended from Zadok. They were in a lower grade than the priests and did not participate in the ritual services; they were in charge only of the music of the temple and the lower services of the same. 

Their number reached 10,000 Levites. Like the priests, they were organized into 24 weekly sections, which were relieved every week, and each one with a chief. In the temple there were 4 permanent positions of Levites: 2 chiefs in charge of the Levitical musicians (the first chief musician and the choirmaster) and 2 chiefs in charge of the Levites servants of the temple (the chief porter and the chief guardian), called _strategoi_.

The Levites were divided into two groups of approximately equal numbers: 

* the singers and musicians (_msrrym_): constituted the upper class of the Levites. They had the function of musical accompaniment, singing and playing instruments, of the daily morning and afternoon worship and on the occasion of private parties. They had a platform for them outside the court of the priests. They were divided into three families, the houses of Heman, Asaf and Ethan or Jedutun, and they were divided into 24 shifts for service. As musical instruments they used to use the cymbals (_msltym_), which were also used to warn when the chants should start; the harp (_nbl_), with twelve strings; the lyre (_kinnor_) with ten strings; and in the outstanding festivals a kind of flutes or clarinets (_hlylym_).
* the servants of the temple (_hazzanîm_) were in charge of the inferior functions of sacristans, which consisted of all kinds of non-cult services: helping the priests to put on and take off the priestly garments, preparing the book of the law for reading , they collected the _lûlab_ (branches for the day of the Tabernacles) and piled them up, they did the cleaning service of the temple (with the exception of the atrium of the priests, which was cleaned by the same priests), and surveillance tasks as temple police. Among the temple guards or Levitical police, three groups must be distinguished: a) gatekeepers at the outer doors of the temple; b) guardians on the terrace, _jêl_, or _pronaos_, (or place of separation that marks the beginning of the area where pagans cannot enter); and c) patrols in the Court of the Gentiles.

It is important to point out that between both groups of Levites, that of singers and that of porters, there was a great social leap in the time of Jesus. The singers were like a layer between the priests and the gatekeepers, and were held in higher regard. 

## The hereditary character of the priesthood

The priestly and Levitical dignity was transmitted by heredity and could not be acquired in any other way; For this reason, it was of vital importance for priests and Levites to preserve the purity of their offspring, to which firstly a careful annotation of genealogies and, secondly, strict rules for marriages contributed. If a priest could not prove his legitimate origin, he forfeited for himself and his descendants the right to the function and income of the temple, and if he performed an illegitimate marriage, the children of that marriage could no longer occupy the temple. position.

In the temple of Jerusalem there was an archive where the genealogies of the clergy were kept up to date. These lists most of the times disappeared when a war or revolt broke out and they always had to be updated, which took time. And the importance of illegitimate marriages at the time has been pointed out above. Many women whom priests married were considered illegitimate because they had been prisoners of war, which invalidated them as wives.

When a son of a priest reached the admitted canonical age of 20, the Sanhedrin examined his bodily fitness and the legitimacy of his origin before allowing him to be ordained. If nothing was objected to him, after a purification bath (baptism) the priestly garments were imposed on him and a series of sacrifices and ceremonies were offered for seven days. 

For the musician Levites there was a similar practice, with a canonical age of 30 years, with an exam and a similar ritual.

When was a priest or a musician Levite of pure origin, so that he had no obstacle to participate in the cult? Whenever it came from the marriage of a priest or a Levite with a woman of the same condition of legal purity as him. When a priest or a singing Levite married, it was necessary to examine the genealogy of his wife. It was very common for priests to marry daughters of priests, which allowed the priestly role of future sons. (This is the case of Zacharias, as we are told in the Gospel, that he was married to Elizabeth, daughter of a priest). These marriages could be within the same priestly family (sometimes reaching the height of close kinship) or between different priestly families. There were also unions between descendants of priests and Levites, and even more so, with daughters of members of the lay nobility. The point was to ensure that the union was legitimate. The women who could not be married were the following: the prostitute, that is, the proselyte, the freed slave and the deflowered (prisoner of war); the raped one, that is, the one born of an illegitimate marriage, or the one repudiated by her husband. And a purity up to four and five previous generations was demanded on her maternal and paternal side.

When a priest or a musician Levite married a woman who was prohibited by law, it was proceeded with implacable severity: the marriage was declared illegitimate and future children deprived of the right to the priesthood. These children were called _halal_ (profane) and their children could never exercise the priesthood either. Hence, the authentic obsession with genealogies among the families of the clergy is understood. And from here that abuses and tricks were also carried out to get admission into the elite of legitimate families. 

## The lay nobility, the elders

Side by side with the priestly aristocracy was a lay nobility, much less important than the other. It was made up of the so-called elders, “the elders of the Jews” (_sabê yahûdayê_ in Hebrew and _presbyteroi tes choras_ in Greek). They form part, together with the priests and the scribes, of the Sanhedrin. These are the heads of the most influential lay families, who represented the lay nobility on the council. They are also sometimes called “the chiefs of the people”, “the first of the city”, “the chiefs of the people”, “the powerful”, the “notable” of the people, the “magistrates of Jerusalem” (_archontes_), and other similar titles.

We have in Joseph of Arimathea, the follower of Jesus, the clear example of this group. According to the gospel he was a rich landowner (_euschemon_), with a plantation near Golgotha, and was a member of the Sanhedrin. 

It was a small group. Specifically, those heads of patrician families in Jerusalem sat in the Sanhedrin. Their privileged position as part of the Sanhedrin gave them special distinctions in liturgical celebrations: on the day of atonement, as members of the Sanhedrin, they accompanied the first of the ten huts, located on the road, to which the priest had to lead. he-goat Azazel to the desert. And their minor male children could enter the court of the Israelites, normally reserved only for adults.

We are aware of eight families of this rank, who had retained an ancient privilege of supplying the wood needed for the temple sacrifices. These are their names, with their corresponding tribes: Arah of Judah, David of Judah, Parosh of Judah, Jonadab of Rechab, Senaah of Benjamin, Zattuel of Judah, Pajat-Moab of Judah, and Adin of Judah. In Jesus' time descendants of these families sat in the Sanhedrin. 

The Roman procurator in Judea chose the tax officials, the _dekaprotoi_, from among the elders, who were in charge of collecting the required tribute from the citizens subject to taxes. 

These elders had little influence over the town and lived with mostly Sadducean tendencies, following the Sadducean organization and tradition.

## The Scribes 

The scribes (_safra_, pl. _soferim_) were not only found in the upper strata of society. Scribes were often held by people from different social groups, from aristocratic families to simple priests, Levites, and even commoners. They could even come from Israelite families without genealogical purity. However, they constitute a rising power at the time of Jesus. They are designated as _grammateis_, the “experts of the Scripture”, “the learned” (_homines literati_), and also as _nomikoi_ or jurists (Mt 22:35; Lk 7:30; 10:25; 11:45s.52; 15:3) or _nomodi-dascaloi_, “doctors of the Law” (Lk 5:17; Acts 5:34). Flavius ​​Josephus calls them _sophists_ and _patrion exegetai nomon_. Finally, the denomination of sages (_hakam_, pl. _hakamim_) was frequent.

The only factor of power of the scribes was in knowledge. Whoever wished to be admitted to the corporation of the scribes by ordination had to go through a regular cycle of studies of several years. The young Israelite who wished to consecrate his life to the erudite activity of writing began the cycle of his formation as a student (_talmîd_). The teaching began in the young years, already from the age of twelve and thirteen. The student was in a personal relationship with his teacher and listened to his teaching. When he had mastered all the traditional subject matter and the method of the oral tradition (_halaká_), to the point of being able to make personal decisions in matters of religious legislation and criminal law, he became a “non-ordained doctor” (_talmîd hakam_). But only when he had reached the canonical age for ordination, in about 40 years, he was ordained a scribe or “ordained doctor” (_safra_ or _hakam_), receiving ordination (_samikah_). From then on he was authorized to settle questions of religious and ritual legislation himself, to be a judge in criminal proceedings and to make civil decisions, either as a member of a court of law or individually.

From that moment they had the right to be called _rabbís_ or _rabbunís_ or _rabbán_, that is, rabbis or teachers, although the term means “lord” or “chief”. In the time of Jesus, however, this term created some controversy. At that time not only were the scribes considered _rabbis_, but it was an honorary title given to those who deserved it. This was the case with Jesus of Nazareth, and with John the Baptist. As the years passed, the irritation of the scribes was getting the title reserved only for them. In addition, they were called “father” (_pater_), a designation that indicates the clear adoration and veneration that these men were beginning to have.

This esteem of the people meant that they were always given preference in positions, as reflected in the Gospels: «They love the first places at banquets and the seats of honor in the synagogues, that they bow to them in the street and that people call them 'my lord'' (Mt 23:6-7; Mk 12:38-39; Lk 11:43; 20:46). They even dressed in the style of the priests and nobles, with _stoles_, large cloaks that fell to their feet with large fringes, and in the synagogue they could sit with their backs to the Torah cabinet and facing the attendees.

Only ordained doctors created and transmitted the tradition derived from the Torah, which, according to the Pharisees, was equal to or above the Torah itself. His decisions had the power to “bind and loose” forever in the civil and religious questions of his time. For those who had completed rabbinical studies, all the doors of key positions in law, administration and teaching were opened in this way.

Together with the priests and elders, they formed an integral part of the Sanhedrin. All the Pharisees of the Sanhedrin were scribes. But there were also scribes who were not Pharisees. They could be Sadducees, although the Pharisees scribes were the majority, hence in many writings the Pharisees and the scribes are imprecisely designated as synonyms. Prominent members of the Sanhedrin at the time of Jesus were the scribes Shemaya, Nicodemus, Gamaliel I, his son Simon, etc. There were also scribes in the courts.

When a community had to choose between a layman or a scribe for a position of elder, synagogue chief, or judge, the scribe was usually preferred, and so they increasingly held important positions in Jesus' time. One of the reasons for this was not only the knowledge of the religious tradition, but also the possession of an esoteric and occult tradition. This knowledge contained secret assumptions about cosmology, about the origin of creation and about apocalyptic. These Jewish esoteric teachings were not isolated theological teachings, but constituted great theological systems or doctrinal constructions whose content was attributed to divine inspiration. There was great respect for it, and the dissemination of literature on these topics was strictly prohibited. In the time of Jesus, there was a belief that some teachings (such as the story of the sacred chariot, the name of God and the story of creation) gave magical powers to those who received them. That is why these teachings, like those contained in Ezekiel and Genesis, were taught by the teachers with a soft and reverential voice, and with their heads covered with a veil, and they tried to hide them in secret and offer them only in a private and privileged way.

However, all its educational activities were to be free. It was forbidden for a scribe to charge for his work as a teacher, or to receive gifts. So they had to earn their living in some other way. In this sense, we appreciate a clear opposition of Jesus to many of the practices of the scribes. For Jesús, the impossibility of charging for a religious education job seems unaffordable. “The laborer has a right to his sustenance” (Mt 10:10; Lk 10:7; [UB 140:9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p9)). He also advocated that there should be nothing occult, nothing esoteric (Mt 10:26-27; Lk 12:1-9; [UB 150:4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p4)). The teachings of Jesus were to be open to everyone and in everything. Another element of possible disagreement with Jesus, although it does not appear reflected in the gospel, it is the rabbinic custom of repeating the teachings. The student rabbi had to faithfully remember everything learned, since it was not recorded in writing, and it was forbidden to make any alteration to the received doctrine. “Everyone who forgets a word of his instruction in the Torah, let him realize that he has wasted his life” (Abot 3: 8) and “Everyone must copy the expression of his teacher” (Edu 1 : 3). The highest praise a disciple could receive was to be compared to “a well-revoked cistern that does not let a drop escape.” However, we see that Jesus does not offer his disciples a repetitive teaching and that he does not use the rote method in his preaching. His lessons seem occasional and he uses examples or parables depending on the circumstance. By last, it seems that Jesus was against the age of ordination being 40, since he ordained as apostles a much younger group of disciples. For Jesus, age did not represent a degree by itself.

# Social classes in the time of Jesus 

We distinguish three social strata, rich, middle class and poor. 

## The rich 

a) The court

The Jewish people in the time of Jesus lived under the auspices of the Herodian family. First with Herod the Great, then with his sons, there was a court surrounding the prince or king. This court conducted official life; even in the times of Roman domination the princely courts exercised their role, although they were only pale reflections of their former magnificence. 

Los reyes y príncipes solían gozar de un buen número de mujeres, como Herodes el Grande, que tuvo diez. Junto a ellas también disponían de un numeroso harén de concubinas. Vivían también en palacio toda la familia del rey o principie, y eran frecuentemente invitados a palacio todos los amigos y parientes, por muy lejanos que fueran, del monarca.

Estos palacios reales estaban servidos por una basta tropa de guardias, porteros, sirvientes, asistentes de cámara, ministros, cancilleres, guardaespaldas, compañía, músicos y todo un largo etcétera. Ese séquito, evidentemente, no vivía todo él al mismo tren que los dirigentes, pero sí gozaba de una envidiable posición social.

Next to the court of the sovereign there were also other minor courts, which were also in the palace, and had their own retinue and their particular service.

The tax revenue of the monarchs was impressive. Only in this way could they cope, and sometimes not even in this way, with the considerable expenses of their luxuries and extravagance. Herod Antipas received in taxes from his territory 200 talents; Philip, 100; Archelaus, and presumably then the attorneys, about 500; and Salome in his territories, 60. That is to say, that the totality of the Jewish territory could contribute between 800 and 1000 talents. At the time of Herod the Great, this figure could even be higher, because the cities of Gaza, Gadara and Hippos also belonged to his kingdom, which later passed to the province of Syria. Take as a comparison that a talent of the time came to be about €300,000 in 2006.

Despite these incomes, the monarchs were unable to meet their expenses. Herod also possessed an impressive private fortune, and made great wealth by confiscating the assets of many nobles. In addition, the emperor Augustus gave him, in 12 BC, the copper mines of Soli, in Cyprus, which gave him new income. Finally, the gifts, or rather, the bribes, came to cover more than one hole in the finances of the princes. 

b) The wealthy class

There was an upper aristocratic stratum, made up, first of all, of the priestly nobility and members of the high priest's family. They derived their income from the temple treasury, from the lands they owned, from temple trade, and from nepotism in appointing their relatives to the leading magistracies, which increased the family's wealth. The high priest had to bear the expense of the position; for example, he had to pay out of pocket for the sacrifice of the Great Day of Atonement. For representational reasons he was obliged to have his house open to everyone. In the families of the high priests there was enormous luxury. They generally belonged to the wealthiest families in Palestine.

With the circle of the high priest belong to the upper stratum of the rich the great merchants and the great landowners, called _eyschemon_, who were represented as elders in the high council, the Sanhedrin, and who for the most part lived in or near Jerusalem. , as well as tax tenants. This was the case with Jesus' two friends, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. In their homes they also led a life of luxury, visible in the ostentation of their home and clothing, at banquets and in jewelry, and in the trousseau of their daughters when they married. In the magnificent banquets that they gave, it was customary to make a previous invitation communicating the names of the guests and send a second definitive invitation on the day of the banquet, which is reflected in the parable of Jesus about the guests at the banquet. There were even open banquets to which anyone who wanted to attend was invited. Music and dance accompanied these treats. These houses were intended to emulate the royal court, which surpassed all in luxury and pageantry.

## The middle class 

Alongside the large merchant who imports goods from afar and deposits them in department stores is the small merchant who has his shop in one of the small bazaars. Here it is necessary to distinguish between the big merchants (_emporoi_) and small merchants (_kapeloi_). Moreover, the artisans, to the extent that they own their workshops and do not work as wage earners in other people's homes, fully belong to this middle class. There were no factories, and therefore there was no working class. From the artisans it went directly to the employees or serfs, and to the slaves.

In ordinary life, the normal practice was not to pay daily wages unless expressly requested; usually paid within 24 hours after completion of work; in the temple, on the other hand, the prescription of the scriptures was scrupulously observed, which ordered to pay the salary on the same day of work. Certainly, taking great advantage of the temple was considered a serious fault. 

Frequent trips made lodging a whole business. Frequent pilgrimages, especially to the holy city, were also a source of work for many middle-class families.

A large number of priests also belonged to the middle class; Most of them lived by practicing a craft or trade, apart from tithes, of which they received a part. However, the income from these cannot be overestimated, since, on the one hand, the number of priests was excessively large and, on the other hand, the tithes were given very reluctantly and in many cases were not even paid. When it was done, it was done in products of the field. To this were added, although only during the days of their service in the temple, part of the sacrifices and the first fruits that were offered in the thanksgiving festivals for the harvest. 

## The poor

The number of poor was great. Among them, the most numerous, were the day laborers; the average daily wage of a silver denarius roughly covered the minimum needs of a small family. If he did not find work for several days, the day laborer was left in the most absolute misery.

Slaves and freedmen, the latter especially in the immediate period after their emancipation, had no property or income and were therefore forced to live off the help of others. Jewish slaves were in Jewish houses under the protection of the law and were considered as day laborers who sold their work for a certain period; the sabbatical year, which was repeated every seven years, brought them freedom if their master was Jewish. More serious was the position of the pagan slaves, who frequently tried to improve it with their conversion to Judaism, becoming proselytes. These did not reach the protection of the sabbatical year. Their masters could apply corporal punishment to them. They had no rights. But, in any case, the number of slaves could not have been very large in Palestine.

Among the poor there were also many doctors of the law or scribes. The incompatibility between the study of the Torá and the exercise of a profession prevailed very soon. As the teaching of the law was to be free, the teachers had to live on the help they were given, which consisted, more or less, in the invitation to take part in the banquets held in other houses and in the support they received from their friends. administrators and minions. This seems to be shown in the life of Jesus and his disciples, since Jesus was considered as a rabbi. The doctors of the law were included in the distribution of the tithe of the poor, to which the amount of the tithes was destined every three and six years. Their poverty aroused in them a certain covetousness and led them to abuse hospitality; for example, that of widows, whose rights they declared themselves willing to represent, a fact that Jesus especially reproaches. Instead, the doctors of the law who were in the service of the temple had regular income; however, their number was not great, since there were also doctors of the law among the priests.

A special role was played by beggars. Most of them were blind, crippled or mutilated, who were forced to beg. There was no official social security. If these individuals did not want to be a burden to their family, they had to beg. In reality, the family often abused their status, since charity and almsgiving were held in high esteem by the Jews as especially meritorious deeds. A good beggar's post at the gates of the temple, on pilgrims' paths or in places of purification, such as in the pool of Bethsaida, or at the exit of the Siloam canal, could be very profitable. With the truly poor beggars were intermingled pretenders, who pretended to be blind and crippled, idlers and unsocial individuals, who exploited charity especially on religious festivities. The blind, the crippled or the truly mutilated were in a difficult situation not only economically, but also religiously. The law forbade them to enter the sanctuary. Those suffering from leprosy also figure in the series of poor and excluded, who are relegated to living on charity. Against the background of such provisions, the stories of miracles that refer to Jesus take on all the conflictive aspect of him: with his healing, access to the kingdom of God was opened to the sick. who are relegated to living on charity. Against the background of such arrangements, the stories of miracles that refer to Jesus take on all the conflictive aspect of him: with his healing, access to the kingdom of God was opened to the sick. who are relegated to living on charity. Against the background of such arrangements, the stories of miracles that refer to Jesus take on all the conflictive aspect of him: with his healing, access to the kingdom of God was opened to the sick.

Poverty in the times of Jesus was gradually increasing. The abusive exploitation of the country by the kings and governors, as well as the wars and looting that took place over and over again during the hectic events of this period, greatly contributed to this fact. All this brought with it hunger and famine, as well as the bodily mutilation of not a few of the inhabitants of it. But there was no shortage of attempts to help when major catastrophes arose. Similar relief efforts are reported from Herod the Great during the severe famine crisis of 25-24 BC Private charity was encouraged and held in high esteem. A legal sanction was given to the aspiration of the poor to share the harvest. A corner of the farms was left for them without harvesting, that they could collect in the fields and in the vineyards after the harvest. The fallen grapes during the harvest belonged to them. Also the cultural communities made efforts to help the poor or impoverished people. It is also convenient here to remember that Jesus, in his preaching, was not indifferent to this reality of his people. Through his teachings, the existence of many people who live in the most extreme poverty and their concern for social assistance can be guessed, as in the case of the poor widow who makes an offering to the temple.

# Religious and Political Groups in the Times of Jesus 

## The Pharisees 

Organization of the Pharisees

The Pharisees, whose name meant “the separated ones” (_parûs_) or “the saints” (_qadôs_), were the most prominent religious group at the time of Jesus. They were called that because they advocated being the “remnant chosen by God” for salvation, the true messianic community that on the day of judgment would be the first to be saved. It was not made up precisely of people from the upper stratum, but it encompassed all social categories, and even people without training for the most part. However, his relationship with the scribes was very close. All the Pharisees in the Sanhedrin were scribes, and although there could be non-Pharisee scribes, they were not common. That is why Pharisee and scribe were words in the time of Jesus that almost came to mean the same thing.

The Pharisees were grouped in Pharisaic communities (_habûrôt_), with a very closed tendency. You couldn't be a Pharisee if you didn't belong to some _habûrôt_. In Jerusalem alone, at the time of Jesus, there were several of these communities. They had in themselves many purposes of public interest and charitable works. They were a very important part of Pharisee thinking, whose basic pillars were: purity, the prescriptions of the law, and good charitable works.

The Pharisaic communities of Jerusalem had specific rules for the admission of members, which shows their character as particular communities. Before admission there was a trial period of a month or a year, during which the applicant had to give proof of his ability to observe the ritual prescriptions. Once the trial period was over, the candidate undertook to observe the community regulations on purity and tithing; in ancient times this promise took place before a scribe, a member of the community. From then on the Pharisee was a member (_haber_) of an association (_habûrah_).

These associations had their chiefs and their assemblies; these, it seems, were linked to a common meal, especially on Friday afternoon, at the beginning of Saturday. It seems that the Pharisaic associations intervened sometimes in public, to offer condolences or on the occasion of joyous events. They had their own inner justice; among other things, they could rule on the expulsion of a member. 

Despite being the largest religious group, it was rather small. Their number would range from 6,000 to 7,000 throughout Palestine. 

Due to the confusion that was often had about the conceptsscribe and Pharisee were assimilated to one another, but there are clear differences. Not all scribes are Pharisees. The leaders and influential members of the Pharisaic communities were scribes. (Nicodemus was a scribe and a Pharisee, so were the famous Hillel and Gamaliel.) There were also scribes who defended Pharisaic positions without belonging to any _habûrah_, but they were much less than those who did not belong to the Pharisees.

For the most part, the members of the _habûrôt_ were not scribes. There were a large number of priests who were Pharisees. There were also members of the clergy, who without training as scribes, were Pharisees. Precisely the members of the clergy used to submit with great scrupulosity to the Pharisees' demands on purity. The priests took a large part in the Pharisaic movement, which is explained by the fact that this movement had its focus in the temple; this movement tried to elevate to the category of a general norm, valid also for those who were not priests, the prescriptions on the purity that the Scripture imposed on the priests to consume the portion that was reserved for them. But these scribes, priests, and Levites were only the leading part of the Pharisees.

The innumerable prescriptions on the commercial relations between the Pharisees and non-Pharisees make it easier to know the circles that formed the great mass of the Pharisees: they were merchants, artisans and peasants who were part of the _habûrah_. In short, the Pharisaic communities were made up mainly of small commoners, townspeople without scribal training, serious men and ready to consecrate themselves. But, very often, they were hard and proud towards the great mass, the “people of the country” (_'ammê ha-'ares_), who did not observe the religious prescriptions of the Pharisees scribes as they did; Regarding these people, the Pharisees considered themselves to be the true Israel.

As for the organization of the _habûrah_ we must say that they had extraordinary similarities with that of the Essene communities, since not in vain both movements were formed at the same time (the Maccabean revolution). Hence, the same admission methods used by the Essenes are used for the Pharisaic communities: an inspector scribe (_archonte_ for the Pharisees and _mabaqqer_ for the Essenes) was in charge of examining the candidate. The inspector makes him aware of the secret legal provisions of the community. The candidate takes an oath of entry, is entered on the list of members and undergoes a test for two years, at the end of which he is considered a full member. Serious offenses are punished with temporary or permanent exclusion. 

Thought of the Pharisees

The Pharisees were concerned with the strict interpretation and observance of the Torah, being the most radical in applying the precepts in as much detail as possible. In fact, they held the traditional interpretation of the Torah, the _halakah_ or oral tradition, in as much, if not more, esteem than the written Torah itself. “It is more guilty to teach against the teachings of the scribes than against the Torah itself,” they said.

They believed in the immortality of the soul and in the existence of a life after death, where the righteous are resurrected in a new material body and the wicked suffer eternal punishment. The resurrection would take place at the end of time, when the messianic kingdom would prevail. The performance of good deeds is for them, therefore, an essential aspect to guarantee salvation in the future world. This aspect of the resurrection distanced them from their staunch opponents, the Sadducees, who denied this doctrine. Similarly, the Pharisees admitted the existence of angels and demons, while the Sadducees did not.

Also the doctrine of divine providence and destiny separated Pharisees and Sadducees. The Pharisees believed that both good deeds and fate and God are necessary for man's salvation. They maintained that the first origin of everything is the destiny and the will of God, although they admit certain importance to the works of man. However, the Sadducees absolutely deny destiny and argue that God offers man the free will to decide between good and evil, so it is human actions that cause a favorable or unfortunate destiny.

They considered it essential to separate and not have contact with people who, acting lightly, contracted ritual impurity on the occasion of innumerable prescriptions derived from the Torah. They tried to relate and live with Pharisees with the same principles, locked up in their own communities, avoiding the common people as much as possible. The _haber_ did not enter the houses of the commoners, _am ha-ares_, nor did they accept them as guests, especially because of the impurity (dirt) that the clothes of the commoners could harbor. 

## The Sadducees 

Organization of the Sadducees

The origin of this group is in the division that occurred in the Maccabean era. Their name comes perhaps from the fact that they considered themselves the legitimate offspring of Zadok, and therefore with the possibility of occupying the position of leading positions.

To this Sadducee group, apart from the ruling priestly families, also belonged the main patrician families of Jerusalem and the lay nobility of the Jewish countryside, whose representatives constituted, with the priestly aristocracy, part of the high council, the Sanhedrin. But this does not mean that all the priests were Sadducees, since there were also a good number of priests who were Pharisees or who simply did not belong to either faction. Basically, the Sadducean priests were the priests belonging to the most distinguished families and constituents of the institutions of power.

The Sadducees occupied a prominent place in Jewish history in the period from the Hasmoneans to the Jewish war. During this time, Judaism was radically transformed by Hellenistic and Babylonian religious influences. In the grouping of the Sadducees, liberal and conservative tendencies were associated: liberal in regard to the acceptance of Hellenistic ways of life, and conservative in regard to the preservation of the religious status of the temple state founded on law.

The Sadducees were an organized group. The number of his supporters is not very high. They had a tradition (_halaká_) based on the interpretation of writing, a tradition that members had to follow in the conduct of their lives. Membership in the Sadducee group, like that of the Pharisees, was limited. It could not belong to anyone. 

Thought of the Sadducees

Some of their beliefs have already been seen in contrast to the Pharisees: they denied life after death, the existence of angels and demons, and providence or destiny, doctrines imported from other religions and that barely appeared in Jewish writings. Sadducean theology adhered strictly to the text of the Torah or Pentateuch (the law), particularly with regard to the prescriptions relating to worship and the priesthood; he was, therefore, in open opposition to the Pharisees and their oral _halakah_, which declared obligatory, even for pious lay circles, the oral injunctions on purity relating to priests. The Sadducees had consigned this theology in a fully elaborated _halakah_ founded on exegesis.

As for the issue of purity, they accepted only the prescriptions that emanated directly from the Torah, so their customs were more relaxed, except for the chief priests who were in charge of celebrating the cult, whose scrupulousness in matters of impurity was still greater than that of the Pharisees. 

They also rejected the prophetic claims of the Hasidic and Essenian circles. Above all, they condemned the development of apocalyptic and the eschatological ideas linked to it. For them, salvation consisted of the earthly act of purifying themselves and becoming part of the people of Israel. That is why they never accepted foreign domination, although they were very adept at establishing adequate commercial ties with them.

Their limitation to the Torah and their rejection of reformist tendencies made them accept only an earthly vision of man. They equally rejected the Greek theory of the soul and the Persian hope of the resurrection. For them there was no afterlife. “He is not in the law,” they said to justify their position. However, they saw the man free in his actions and responsible for his actions, which should be governed by the law. Hence, they issued severe sentences against offenders, which they applied according to their own penal code. The Pharisees, due to their constant oral reinterpretation of the written law, tried to adapt and soften the sentences. There was a Sadducean court of chief priests, and they pronounced sentences according to their own right. There were scribes who were Sadducees, though few. 

## The Essenes

The Essenes (_eseos_ or _essenoi_) were a true religious sect that was formed as a result of the division with the Hasidians in the Maccabean era. Their number hovered around 4,000, scattered throughout Judea and Galilee. They lived in rural communities, avoiding the cities and following a way of life that was already taught to the Greeks by Pythagoras. Certainly these curious men had much in common with the Pythagoreans: they organized themselves into communes, shared land and property, and practiced such virtues as abstinence, modesty, self-discipline, discretion, and strict spiritual and bodily purity.

They were a strictly organized group. There were registers with the registration of each member, which were made according to an order that was also valid for meetings: priests, Levites, Israelites and proselytes. There are prescriptions that exactly regulate admission to the community. Only adults can be admitted in the number of those who are inspected, and the minimum age to enter the congregation was 20 years.

Before entering the order, the aspirant had to pass outside it for a year of probation, in which he had to live in fidelity to the law and then for a two-year novitiate. The first year the seriousness of the novice's purposes was confirmed and he was indoctrinated in the precepts of the community. During that time he lived, so to speak, on the threshold, according to the rules of it. He kept his property and still could not take part in the plenary assemblies or in the sacred meals of the community. After this period, if he was deemed worthy of the community, his property passed to the administration of the community, but he was still kept apart from the common property. His abilities and his work already belonged to the community. At the novice's acceptance, which took place on the Covenant renewal festival,

The organization of the community was adjusted to the division of the Jewish camp and army into thousands, hundreds and dozens, according to hierarchical criteria. There were four classes. In this organization the priests and Levites played a special role, but there were also ministries for the laity. The order was governed by a commission of twelve lay members and three priests. Each one had his rank and held his position, which was set according to his age, knowledge and efficiency. They observed strict composure among themselves and gave total obedience to their superiors. Any fault against these and against the precepts was rigorously punished. The community council had judicial powers over its members and there was a criminal law that listed what was considered misconduct among members.

They attached great importance to ritual purity, lavatories and ritual baths, much more than the Pharisees. Baptism was a compulsory rite every year. There were very important ritual purifications, like the one that was done before the meal. For all these rituals, the monasteries had cisterns, baths and water pipes to supply the necessary water. 

They had a great community spirit. They all ate together, they had all the goods in common, and any profit obtained became part of the community money deposit, which was administered equally among the members. They lived in total austerity and poverty. Always the same dress and shoes, they did not have any kind of luxuries and everything was regulated with the most complete sobriety.

As for their customs, they had no slaves with them, they never swore oaths except on the day of their admission, they refused anointing with oil, they bathed in cold water before each meal and after contracting any impurity, they relieved themselves in places sections that are then covered so as not to contaminate the home. They did not prohibit marriage but used to live celibate. 

As far as the government was concerned, an inspector (_mabaqqer_), aged over 30 and under 50, was in charge of each camp. He is a scribe who teaches the exact meaning of the law, since great importance was attached to the knowledge of the scriptures, and to whom one had to go to manifest the faults committed.

The Essenes call themselves “the converts of Israel”, “the converts of the desert” or “the men of the council of God”. They consider themselves the true redoubt of the loyal people of Israel, “the few” who would be saved by God at the end of time.

Their doctrine and their vision of themselves is based on the core of their teachings: everything that happens in the world is planned by God. They maintain an eschatological vision of the times. The time when God was going to reestablish Israel as a light to the nations was near. They believed in the arrival of the Messiah and Elijah. They specialize in doctrines about angels and spirits. The doctrine about the spirit of truth or light and that of injustice or darkness, which reminds us of the Gospel of John, is his work. They also believe that man at birth receives the spirit of God, that after being purified of his stains in this life is renewed by the Holy Spirit of God, making man a son of truth and light, and by a third spirit, a child of heaven equal to the angels.

The Essene communities (_yahad_) maintain a different Alliance with God than that of the common Jewish people. It is an Alliance within the community. That is why its most important annual celebration is the feast of the renewal of the Covenant, a feast that was not celebrated in the same way and with the same meaning by the common Jewish people of the time of Jesus. That is why they also have a different calendar, solar and not lunar, and the Essene Jewish holidays were always made to coincide on the same days of the week. With all this they showed their character of opposition that they had against the authorities of the Jerusalem temple, and their closed and rigid character in the face of popular custom. 

## Therapists

It is a Jewish sect with very similar characteristics to the Essenes, so much so that researchers even wonder if they were not the same sect or a variant of it. Although they must have had communities everywhere, they were especially numerous in Egypt, especially in the vicinity of Lake Mareotis near Alexandria. They lived as a community, but separating men and women in different areas. Upon entering the order, they abandoned their possessions and during the time they remained there they did not perform any paid work or trade, since they devoted themselves fully to the contemplative life.

The communities were presided over by the oldest member or priest. The hierarchy was based only on the number of years spent in the order. They lived celibate as long as they were there. They also took vows of poverty, having only one summer dress and one summer dress, eating frugally, abstaining from meat and wine, and fasting frequently.

His usual day consisted of a morning prayer facing the sun, a day of scripture study and prayer, an afternoon communal meal, and a sunset prayer facing east. On Saturday the president held worship and delivered a sermon. His most important festival, like the Essenes, was the festival of weeks or Pentecost. This day they ate their sacred food, leavened bread seasoned with salt and hyssop, surpassing in their degree of abstinence even the Jewish priests, who at least on this day did drink wine. Then they sang hymns until nightfall. 

## The Nazirites

The Nazirites constitute a small brotherhood of men and women consecrated to God. They were held in great respect because only they could have access to the holy of holies in the temple, along with the high priest. 

They lived in small communities where they had everything in common. To enter the order, one had to take vows for life: to refrain from all alcoholic beverages, nor from any fruit of the vine, even if it was not fermented; they were to let their hair grow freely; they did not go near places where dead people had been, nor did they touch any dead person or anything that had been in contact with a dead person. It was considered at that time that it was these three things that caused an impurity that prevented being completely pure in the presence of God.

The vow could also be for a period of time, at the end of which they purified themselves for seven days (Num 6:9; Acts 21:27), cut their hair and burned it, and also partook of certain offerings, including unleavened bread. and oil. When the vow was fulfilled, they could once again drink wine and eat grapes. Women used to take the vow voluntarily for the purpose of making a special request to God, or to dedicate themselves to some special purpose. There are biblical examples of the vow being for life (Judges 13:5). A vow was often made in thanksgiving to God; its purpose was not to replace character weakness in the sense that someone needed to vote to be aligned to God's way.

Incidentally, we should not confuse the words Nazirites and Nazarene. The word Nazirite comes from the root _nazir_, which means “separated” or “away from”, while Nazarene denotes a resident of Nazareth. Confusing the words, some have argued that Jesus Christ was under a Nazirite vow, and use that reasoning to argue that this is why he had long hair. But Jesus was not a Nazirite because he drank wine (Mt 11:18-19) and on at least one occasion he touched a dead body (Lk 8:51-54). And so, he could not have had long hair (1Cor 11:14). The apostle Paul took a Nazirite vow, not cutting his hair until the vow was completed (Acts 18:18). And he later shared in the purification rites of four others who completed Nazirite vows (Acts 21:23-27).

Induction ceremonies took place at the headquarters centers of each district. These ceremonies were to be completed with a series of offerings and sacrifices in the temple in Jerusalem. 

These vows were very solemn and conferred a very high distinction on those who adopted them. Samson and Samuel were two illustrious Nazirites. Who was not faithful to his vows was expelled from the order. If he committed any fault, he was obliged to purify himself and offer sacrifices for his compensation.

The colonies where they met were authentic centers of knowledge. They were men who deeply studied the scriptures, led a very monastic rural life, almost in the style of the Essenes, and earned their living from the fruit of the field and livestock and from the gifts that rich Jews often made to order. At the head of each colony was a director. In many things of their organization the Essenes copied these simple brotherhoods or communities. 

They were very few in number. The little more than five colonies that would have meant about 300 Nazirites (_Bereshit Rabbá_ 91:3). 

The law of the Nazirite is described in Numbers 6. 

## The prophetic communities 

They are not true monastic communities, because they do not contemplate separation from the world, celibacy and a common rule.

They exist since the times of Samuel (1 Sam 10:5-6.10-13; 19:20-24), reach their maximum splendor in the times of Elijah (1 Kings 18:4.13.19-20; 20:35) and last until the times of the prophet Amos (Am 7:14), to disappear in exile (Zac 7:3; Neh 6:10-14) 

They were independent and itinerant communities. They revolve around a prophet considered as «Father». They live poorly from their own work or from public charity (2 Kings 4:8.38-44; 6:1-7). They could exist but continence was not mandatory (2 Kings 4:1) 

They were linked to sanctuaries such as Nayot next to Rama (1 Sam 19:18-24), Bethel (1 Sam 10:3-6), the Jericho (2 Kings 2:3), Mount Carmel (2 Kings 2:25). With David they settled in Jerusalem, becoming a body of Levite-prophets. Its components were from the lower layers of society.

## Movements or political forces 

## The Zealots 

The history of Israel between the Maccabean uprising and the war against the Romans is full of resistance movements. The Zealots are just that, a resistance group against the invaders. The founder is a certain Judas the Galileo, and the origin of him as a result of the census and the subsequent collection of taxes that took place the first around the time of the birth of Jesus, and the second in his adolescence.

Their resistance was not based only on armed actions, but they promulgated a series of subversive doctrines, never proclaimed until then, which very soon gave their members a coherence of principles and unity. The movement started from Galilee, although the greatest agitation for the payment of taxes occurred in Judea and then moved north.

In its beginnings, the Pharisaic forces played an important role; It seems that it was mainly the disciples of Rabbi Sammay who swelled the ranks of Zealotism, while the Hillelites, who definitively rose to the preponderance of the rabbinate after the war, adopted a negative attitude towards said movement, although for the moment they did not could be imposed on the Sammayites. The proximity with the thought of the Essenes is also very evident. They hold very close points of view on prophetic questions, and on eschatology and judgment wars. It is quite possible that many of the Essenes became Zealots over time.

The name Zealots speaks of the zeal they had for God and their fiery passion in discussing matters of final judgment and eschatological wars. To the Romans, they were no more than thieves, isolated highwaymen, or entire gangs of bandits. They didn't want to pay much attention to them until they were finally forced to in the Jewish uprising. The designation of assassins, on the other hand, does not seem to include all of the Zealots, but only a group of them, especially active; the name derived from the small daggers (_sica_) that they carried hidden under their cloak and with which they assassinated their adversaries, often in the middle of the crowd. It seems that they were mainly concentrated in Judea and Jerusalem. They are the last ones left as resistance in the Masada fort.

For them, the doctrine with which they justified and undertook the fight was decisive. Its central point is the interpretation they gave to the first commandment. In his view, the kingdom of God in Israel was incompatible with any domination. His revolutionary spirit lay in this fundamental dogma. For centuries Israel had lived under foreign domination and under it had served its God, accepting it as something that God allowed or as a punishment. The Zealots broke with this, and from this break sprang their zeal for God's exclusive monarchy and their resolve to suffer persecution, if need be, as well as to sacrifice money, property, or life for his creed. His readiness to suffer and his strength in martyrdom aroused the admiration of his enemies. With martyrdom they proclaimed their zeal for God and atoned for the sins of Israel. Conversion took on among them the grave modality of denying obedience to earthly powers and only obeying the law of God. The repercussion of this doctrine was all the greater because it sprang from the very core of Jewish beliefs: in the time of Jesus the first commandment was cited together with the _shema_ Israel, and the rabbis did not consider valid any prayer in which God was lacking the king's name. (If not, remember the third sentence of the Lord's Prayer, as Jesus' Jewish prayer). The repercussion of this doctrine was all the greater because it sprang from the very core of Jewish beliefs: in the time of Jesus the first commandment was cited together with the _shema_ Israel, and the rabbis did not consider valid any prayer in which God was lacking the king's name. (If not, remember the third sentence of the Lord's Prayer, as Jesus' Jewish prayer).

(If not, remember the third sentence of the Lord's Prayer, as Jesus' Jewish prayer).

Judas formulated this decisive part of his doctrine in view of the census ordered by Octavian Augustus. The Romans upheld the legal principle that, with the conquest of a country, its lands became the property of the Roman State, whose usufruct was left to the indigenous people. On this principle they based their demand for taxes. But this axiom collided with the Israelite belief that the holy land had been inherited by God to Israel as an inalienable title. Obedience to the commandment of God prohibited, therefore, the Zealots, compliance with the Roman legal principle and as such they interpreted participation in the census. The irritation produced in the town by the high amount of taxes and the hardness of their collection cooperated to accept the zealot thesis. Regarding the census, the Zealots said: “The appraisal brings with it nothing more than an obvious slavery” and, therefore, they exhorted all the people to protect their freedom. The war was triggered precisely by the elimination by the zealots of the tax farmers.

God's unique monarchy, as preached by Judas, was closely intertwined with Israel's freedom and its hostility to Rome. With what force the notion of freedom burst among the Zealots. His notion of freedom was conditioned by eschatological considerations. By freedom was meant the redemption of the end time, for which all pious Israelites prayed daily. While the Pharisees hoped that it would be realized by a miraculous intervention of God, the Zealots were convinced that the belief in the exclusive kingdom of God implied that Israel would make it a reality and that God would reciprocate the heroism of their action. with signs and miracles, to make the work of deliverance successful.

The activity of the Zealots to make their creed of the exclusive kingdom of God a reality developed in different ways. They abhorred images in all their forms, whether they were images of men, especially rulers, or images of animals, most of which had symbolic meaning. The emerging cult of the emperor decisively fomented opposition to Rome; the images of the Emperor were the ones that produced the greatest scandal. The lynchings became the general norm against the impurities and desecrations perpetrated in the precincts of the temple. The revenge of the Zealots fell also on the Israelites who married non-Jewish women. People were forced to be circumcised; Otherwise, he was killed without any consideration. The prophets and false Messiahs accompanied the Zealots on their way:

His social position was revolutionary. They were against the rich, and befriended the poor, the small peasants and landowners, while the big landowners allied themselves with the Romans. The social situation worsened more and more. The poor resented it, the small farmers feared for their land. They had to take out loans and mortgage their farm, until it fell into the hands of the big landowners and their tenants, and from them to the Romans. The Zealots therefore did not stop committing acts of violence against the Romans and against their friends.

Among all this agitated world, it is not surprising that Jesus was confused with a supposed Messiah of those who proliferated at the time, that he was crucified between two zealots, and that even the Sanhedrin accused him of provoking revolts to earn enmity with the Romans. . Without a doubt, many times Jesus had to endure comparisons with the Zealots, and not only that, but the contrary accusations of being on the side of the Romans. In such troubled times it was not easy not to live under suspicion, whether you were on one side or the other. 

## The Herodians

They were a political party that also proposed the expulsion of the Roman power from Palestinian lands, but in this case by implantation of the Herodian kingship. They were a small group of relatives and supporters of the royal family of Herod; its members, Jewish by birth, were at bottom pagan. However, this reason did not make them be despised by the people because they had the Sadducees as allies. Since they lived in a privileged position, they were rich and also skeptical. That is why they did not believe in the considerations of the Zealots, who were supported by the Pharisees and were both zealous defenders of the law. It could be said that the Herodians represented the political party of the rich, while the Zealots represented the political party of the poor. Their number, however, was always much more limited than that of the Zealots.

Jesus, during his life, as is clear from the gospels, had to face some situation with them. 

## The Samaritans 

The Samaritans were a Jewish-pagan mestizo people who lived embedded in a small territory between Judea and Galilee, called Samaria. The attitude of the Jews towards these non-Jewish neighbors of theirs was one of utter contempt.

This feeling of enmity between Jews and Samaritans arose in the following way: Some 700 years before our era, Sargon, king of Assyria, in crushing a revolt in central Palestine, carried off into captivity more than 25,000 Jews from the northern kingdom of Israel. Israel and installed in their place an almost equal number of descendants of the Cutites, Serfavites, and Amatites. Later, Ashurbanipal sent still other groups of settlers to Samaria. The religious enmity between the Jews and the Samaritans dated from the return of those from the Babylonian captivity; on this occasion, the Samaritans actively tried to prevent the rebuilding of Jerusalem. Later they offended the Jews because they offered aid to Alexander's armies. In reward for your friendship, Alexander gave the Samaritans permission to build a temple on Mount Gerizim, where they worshiped Yahweh and their tribal gods and offered sacrifices, all very much in the manner of the Jerusalem temple services. They continued to practice this cult until the time of the Maccabees, when John Hyrcanus, around 129, destroyed his temple on Mount Gerizim. Perhaps there was a slight improvement in the situation towards the end of the 1st century BC. Herod married a Samaritan woman, trying to unite both peoples; but twelve years after Herod's death, under the procurator Coponius (6-9 AD), when Jesus was alive, tempers flared again at a Passover feast for an act of revenge by the Samaritans in retaliation for another of the Jews, by profaning the temple by spreading human bones on the porches. This most serious desecration, which probably resulted in the break-up of the party, provided new nourishment for the old friendship. From this moment on, the hostility between the two groups becomes implacable.

When the Jews of Galilee went to Jerusalem, especially on festivals, they certainly had the custom, in the time of Jesus, to go around Samaria, although sometimes it was unavoidable to cross it, because the detour made the trip much longer. There always used to be incidents, and even bloody encounters. Tempers were very tense on both sides. As we move away from the times of Jesus, the situation calms down and relations between the two peoples improve a lot. 

Hence, it is not surprising that it is surprising that Jesus crosses Samaria to preach there, or that in one of his trips among Samaritans he is despised in a village and is not wanted to give him lodging. These cases were common at that time.

The Samaritans hated the Jews to death, and the Jews called the Samaritans cuteos, and the word Samaritan was a serious insult in the mouth of a Jew. 

The Samaritans attached great importance to descent from the Jewish patriarchs. That claim was denied: they were Cuteos, descendants of Medo-Persian settlers from outside the town. They were also denied all blood ties with Judaism, and vice versa by the Samaritans. The fact of recognizing the Mosaic law and scrupulously observing its prescriptions did not change their exclusion from the community of Israel, since they were suspected of idolatrous worship because of their veneration of the Garizim as a sacred mountain.

This judgment on the Samaritans brought a consequence: they were considered pagan from the cultural and ritual point of view. For them, as a result of the event at Easter, the doors of the temple were closed. For this reason, there was no room for a marriage between the two peoples, and they were even considered impure from birth and as the cause of impurity, which prohibited contact with them. 

However, the reality was often very different. Many Jews lived without problems among Samaritans, and vice versa. It is in this context that the famous parable of Jesus must be understood: he put before the eyes of his compatriots a Samaritan as a model, humiliating for them, of gratitude and love of neighbor that triumphs over nationalist hatred with such old roots. .

# Social situation of Jewish women in the time of Jesus 

The role of women in the Eastern world at that time, and in particular in Israel, was much more suffocating than one might think today. The contempt of the men of those days for their women was something that today is difficult to understand.

For example, when the Jewish woman went out of her house, no matter what for, she always had to have her face covered with a headdress that included two veils on her head, a diadem on her forehead, with hanging ribbons down to her chin, and a headdress. mesh of cords and knots. In this way the features of her face could not be known. The woman who thus left her house without wearing her head covering offended “good customs” to such an extent that her husband had the right and, according to the doctors of the law, even the duty to fire her, without being obliged to pay her. the sum stipulated for the divorce case. And about this, it must be said that there were women who were so strict as well, who didn't reveal themselves in her own house either. Only on the day of the wedding, and if the woman was a virgin and not a widow, she appeared in her courtship with her head uncovered.

It goes without saying that the Israelites, especially those in the cities, must have gone unnoticed in public. The “Judaic” rules then followed held that it was preferable not to speak to women in public for the good of the soul. These rules of “good manners” even forbade meeting a Hebrew alone, and looking at a married woman, or greeting her. It was a dishonor for a student of the scribes to talk to a woman in the street. That rigidity reached such an extreme that the Jewish woman who entertained herself with everyone in the street or who spun at the door of her house could be repudiated, without receiving the payment stipulated in the marriage contract.

But really, don't generalize. There were also exceptions. These rules were taken into account only among the most puritanical groups, especially the Pharisees. The truth is that twice a year, on the 15th of April and the day of atonement, there were dances in the vineyards of the fields, and the girls asserted themselves before the young men. Above all, these prescriptions affected wealthy families, where the woman could lead a retired life, but not in popular families, where economic reasons prevented it: the woman often had to help her husband at work. In addition, freer and healthier relationships reigned in the countryside than in the big cities, where manners and customs were something that was given more importance. In the villages, the woman goes to the fountain for water, he joins the work of the men in the fields, sells products of the harvest, serves at the table, etc. Nor was the custom of covering one's head in the field so rigorously followed.

The situation of the woman in the house was not modified, in relation to this public behavior. The daughters, for example, always had to cede the first places, and even the passage through the doors, to the boys. Her training was strictly limited to housework, as well as sewing and weaving. They took care of the younger siblings and, with respect to the father, they had the obligation to feed him, give him water, dress him, cover him, take him out and put him in when he was old, and wash his face, hands and feet. Their rights, as far as inheritance is concerned, were not the same as those of men. Sons and their descendants preceded daughters.

Parental authority was very large with respect to the minor daughters before their wedding. They were in the possession of her father. The Jewish society of that time distinguished three ages: the youngest (_qatannah_, up to the age of twelve years and one day), the young (_na'arah_, between twelve and twelve and a half years), and the oldest (_bôgeret_, after the age of twelve and a half). Until this last age, the head of the family had all the power, unless the young woman was already engaged or separated. According to this social code, daughters had no right to own anything at all: neither the fruit of their work nor what she could find, for example, on the street. Everything belonged to the father.

The daughter, until she was twelve and a half years old, could not reject a marriage imposed by her father. The father could sell his daughter as a slave, as long as she had not reached the age of twelve. Betrothals used to be celebrated very early. A year after she was older, her daughter celebrated her wedding, then passing from the authority of her father to that of her husband. And really, there was no telling what could be worse. After the purchase contract, because that was basically the betrothal and marriage ceremony, the woman went to live in her husband's house. This generally meant a new charge, in addition to the confrontation with another family foreign to the newcomer, to whom open hostility was almost always manifested.

To tell the truth, the difference between the wife and the slave or a concubine was that the former had a marriage contract and the latter did not. In exchange for very few rights, the wife was burdened with duties: she had to grind grain, sew, wash, cook, nurse the children, make her husband's bed, and, in compensation for her support, spin and spin. weave. Others even added to these obligations those of washing the face, hands and feet, and preparing the husband's cup. The power of the husband and the father reached the extreme that, in case of danger of death, the husband had to be saved first. As polygamy was allowed, the wife had to endure the presence and constant insults of the concubines. But polygamy could only be assumed by wealthy people and it was not usual. As for divorce, that was admitted according to the Mosaic Law, the right was solely and exclusively on the part of the husband. Only he could start the process. This led, logically, to constant abuse.

Naturally, within these limits, the situation of women varied according to particular cases. There were two factors that were especially important: on the one hand, the woman found support in her blood relatives, especially in her brothers, which was essential for her conjugal life; on the other hand, having children, especially boys, was very important to women. The lack of children was considered a great misfortune, even as a divine punishment. The woman, being the mother of a son, was considerate: she had given her husband her most precious gift.

The widowed woman was also linked to her husband on some occasions: when he died without children. In this case, she had to wait, without being able to intervene in anything herself, that the brother or brothers of her late husband entered into a levirate marriage with her or expressed her refusal, without which she could not remarry.

Of course, from the religious point of view, the Israelite woman was also not equated with the man. She was subject to all the prescriptions of the Torah and the rigor of civil and criminal laws, including the death penalty, not having access, however, to any type of religious education. A statement by Rabbi Eliezer, for example, said that “whoever teaches the Torah to her daughter teaches her licentiousness,” and another said: “It is better to burn the Torah than to pass it on to women.” The woman was not obliged to go on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem for the festivals of Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles, to dwell in the tents at the festival and wave the _lûlab_, to sound the _sopar_ on New Year's Day, to read the book of Esther (_magillah_) on the _Purim_ festival, reciting the _semá_ every day, etc. Of the two parts of the synagogue, _sabbateion_ and _andron_, the first, dedicated to liturgical service, was also accessible to women; on the contrary, the other part, intended for the lessons of the scribes, was only accessible to men and boys, as its very name indicates. But this was not followed exactly, because in families of high rank, daughters were given a secular education, making them learn Greek.

Women's religious rights, as well as duties, were limited. Women could only enter the temple to the Court of the Gentiles and the Court of Women; during the days of monthly purification and for a period of 40 days after the birth of a boy and 80 days after that of a girl they could not even enter the court of the Gentiles. During this period women were considered sources of impurity and had to be kept away from places of worship. It was unusual for women to lay their hands on the heads of sacrificial victims and shake their portions. Women could enter the part of the synagogue used for worship; but there were some barriers and a grating that separated the place destined for the women. Later, a gallery with a private entrance was even built for them. In the liturgical service, the women were limited only to listen. They couldn't do the reading because it was very rare for them to know how to read and much less was it expected of them that they could do public teaching.

In the house, the woman was not counted in the number of people invited to pronounce the blessing after the meal, nor did she have the right to testify in court. Quite simply, she was considered a liar by nature. 

To conclude, it was very significant that the birth of a boy was a reason for joy, and that of a girl was accompanied by indifference, and even sadness. Rabbinic writings went so far as to proclaim: “Woe to him whose children are girls!”

Taking into account all these precedents, the value represented by the fact that Jesus also surrounded himself with women, that he conversed freely with them and that he treated them as men would be valued more in its fair measure; and even that he instilled those same new spirits and feelings in the minds of the men who knew him. In the story of _Jesus of Nazareth_, the teacher, in an unprecedented action for the time, came to appoint a group of women as preachers, even ahead of our time. This attitude brought nothing but enormous headaches and failures for the Rabbi, and the first Christians did not take long to silence these positions so as not to lose followers.

# Groups according to racial purity in the time of Jesus

If there has been a more characteristic people in terms of the racial purity of the unions and the separation from the rest of the peoples of the world, that has been the Jewish people of the time of Jesus. The different social groups were often marked by this fundamental Jewish idea of ​​preserving the purity of the people. The priests, as the holy head of the people, scrupulously guarded the legitimacy of the priestly families and separated from their bosom all the descendants of priests who had been born from an illegitimate union. But they were not the only ones: in the theory and practice of religious legislation in the time of Jesus, the whole community was also distributed according to its purity of origin. Only those who could claim a legitimate origin were considered true Israelites. The reason for all this lies in the belief of “God's chosen people” held by the Jews of that time. They, the legitimate Israelites, were the authentic children of God, chosen by Him, and in whom His promises would be poured out at the end of time.

Next we are going to see these groups in order of Jewish purity from highest to lowest. 

## The pure-origin Israelites 

Together with the clergy (priests and Levites), the pure-origin Israelites constituted the authentic Israel. 

To enjoy some very important civic rights, it was necessary to prove that one was of legitimate origin. Every legitimate Israelite knew his closest ancestors and could indicate which of the twelve primitive tribes he belonged to. Even if any Israelite wanted to hold public office, he was required to undergo a test of legitimacy, accounting for the last five generations of him.

In the time of Jesus the most frequent tribe to which one belonged was that of Judah, and through it, to the family of David. The fact is easily explained because at that time David's family conferred distinction for the messianic hope. To marry or become related in any way to this large family of David was a great honor. 

Another of the families or tribes to which one belonged a lot was that of Benjamin. (This was the case with Paul the apostle and his teacher Gamaliel). There were few people who were related to this tribe.

Thus, any pure Israelite worth his salt, whether poor or rich, had some form of written record of his ancestors down to at least the fifth generation. And these genealogies in the time of Jesus were something that was preserved and kept in families with great value.

The main privilege granted by the designation of legitimate Israelite was that only they could marry their daughters with priests. Only Israelite mothers of pure origin could give birth to children worthy of performing the service of the altar in Jerusalem, which was the highest peak to which one could aspire. But this right was not the only one. All dignities, all positions of trust, and all important public posts were reserved for full-fledged Israelites. Proof of purity of origin was required to become a member of the highest courts, the Sanhedrin, and one of the 23-member courts, which had the right to hand down capital sentences. This extended even to court clerks and bailiffs, as well as the officials of the community (especially the local council of seven members) and the men of trust entrusted by the community with the care of alms. In all these cases the genealogy was examined before a position was granted.

There were even places in Palestine where this was done in a particularly exclusive way and where the privileges of legitimate Israelites were even more extensive. In Sepphoris, even where there was a Jewish garrison, proof of ancestry was required to belong to the troops.

However, of all the mentioned civic rights enjoyed by legitimate citizens, we have not yet mentioned the most important one: the religious one. Thanks to the pure origin one could, in the first place, be sure to participate in the messianic salvation, and secondly, to participate in the merits of the ancestors, which were transmitted to the children and had a substitution function. This second participation was carried out in a double way: a) according to the common doctrine, all of Israel participated in the merits of the patriarchs, especially Abraham. These merits were to receive prayers, protect in danger, assist in war, supply the merits that each one lacked, atone for faults, appease the wrath of God, suspend his punishments, deliver from the _Gêhinnôm_ and grant participation in the kingdom. eternal of God; b) but,

## The despised trades 

Family origin was not the only thing that marked the men and women of that time. There were also a series of trades that were considered despicable and lowered socially, more or less inexorably, those who exercised them. We are going to detail these trades and the reason that made them be despised: 

* trades related to transport: donkey drivers, camel drivers, sailors and coachmen. These people were suspected of being thieves, since they transported goods and could be tempted to steal something from them.
* Pastors: they did not enjoy a good reputation. As experience proved, they were most of the time cheats and thieves, leading the herds to other people's properties and, in addition, stealing part of the products of the herds. That is why it was forbidden to buy wool, milk or kids, and to do so only directly from the owners of the cattle. 
* shopkeepers: suspected of exploiting their customers. 
* doctors: it used to be said: “the best of doctors is good for hell”. They are mentioned as thieves, as they were suspected of giving their preferences to the rich and neglecting the poor, who paid poorly. 
* butchers: they are suspected of not being honest, since they are exposed to the temptation of selling _tarepah_ meat, or meat from animals affected by deadly physical defects.
* garbage collector, tanner and copper smelter: three of the most despised trades. If someone exercised one of these three trades, his wife had the right to demand a divorce in court and the payment of the money of the marriage contract. 
* weavers or tailors: suspected of immorality since his trade was considered women's work. 
* trades that relied on fraud and were outlawed: dice players, loan sharks, gambling organizers, sabbatical dealers, tax collectors, publicans (or customs tax collectors) and money changers. Pharisees who accepted a publican position were forced to leave the Pharisaic community.

Those who exercised these trades could not hold high positions in public office. In many cases their testimony was not accepted in a trial. In a word: they were deprived of the civic and political rights that every Israelite could possess. This fact allows us to appreciate how striking it was at that time that Jesus called a publican to be his intimate disciple and that he announced the good news to publicans and sinners under the symbol of a community banquet.

Also within this group of despised people we can include those called by the Orthodox Jews _am-ha-arez_. Although the word meant “the people of the land”, with the passage of time, the term _am-ha-arez_ had acquired a pejorative tinge, permanently fueled by the hatred and insidiousness of the rabbis and the priestly castes. Hillel claimed that the _am-ha-arez_ had no conscience, and did not reach the category of men.

Orthodox Jews ended up giving this description to all the human groups that, according to them, had usurped the land of Israel, especially after the Babylonian exile. During this deportation, many of the lands of Palestine were occupied by peoples of pagan and impure origin: Samaritans, Philistines, Arameans, and others. Upon their return, the Jews did not forgive them for this usurpation, and the hatred and contempt towards the _am-ha-arez_ reached the extreme of being defined in the Talmud as those “who do not eat their bread in a state of ritual purity.”

In this state of things, the fact that Jesus preached to these poor people, deprived of all education, and they listened to him with pleasure, can be better understood. His position, many times, reached the levels of a poor slave. Those men, elderly, adults, and even children, were treated without mercy. During the work it was allowed to flog them, hit them and insult them with all kinds of imprecations and ill-treatment, all as long as they made an effort. 

## Jewish slaves

The so-called “Jewish slaves” were not so. These were people who worked as day laborers for a maximum of six years and then abandoned their service, unlike pagan slaves, whose servitude was perpetual. Hence the difference in price: a Jewish slave cost about 5 mines, while a pagan 100 mines. 

The number of Jewish slaves in Palestine was not high and their legal status was regulated by law. A Jew could become a slave in three ways:

1. In the event that a thief could not restore the equivalent of the theft. According to the law it was sold by imposition of the court. The sale could only be made to Jewish men. Herod the Great imposed that they could also be sold to foreigners. Women could not avail themselves of this situation, so a thief found herself in a more precarious situation: either someone returned what was stolen for her, or a physical punishment was imposed on her.
2. A Jew could also sell himself as a slave. It used to happen in cases of extreme poverty. He could only be done with men and not with women. Sale to non-Jews was possible, but that imposed the duty of ransom on relatives. Most of the time it was a desperate gesture from a man in debt, who had lost all hope. Israelite women were forbidden, which put poor women, especially widows, at a dead end.
3. Girls under the age of twelve could be sold to a man. Normally this meant that the girl became the wife of the Jew, but other times there was no wedding, and everything consisted of a contract of sale between the father of the girl and the buyer. The poor girl, more often than not, was then exploited as a worker in the house of her lord.

The state of slavery with a Jewish owner lasted six years and could not last any longer, unless the slave renounced his liberation and transformed it into perpetual service, in which case it ended with the death of the master. This happened especially when the Jewish slave had children of a non-Israelite slave belonging to her owner and did not want to separate from her or her children. He could also end the term early if the ransom for his release was paid.

Regarding the legal situation of the Jewish slave, it must be said that slave service was not considered dishonorable, and the owner had to prevent the Jewish slave from dishonorable slave labor. The Jewish slave, legally equal to the eldest son of the family, was entitled to the same treatment as his owner: good food, good clothing and a good bed. Unlike the pagan slave, he could acquire goods by find or gift and pay to shorten his time of service. Nor could the owner of it consecrate it by means of an injunction; if he was married, his owner was obliged to support his wife and children. In a word: the legal situation of the Jewish slave was regulated according to the prescription of the law: “he must be in your house as a day laborer.” He was like a worker who rented for six years, to a certain owner,

Only at one point was the male Jewish slave deprived of his rights, where the law prescribes: “If it was his owner who gave the slave a wife, by whom he had sons and daughters, then the wife and children belong to the slave.” to the owner; the slave will go alone.' Since an adult Jewish woman could not be the slave of a Jew, the passage was interpreted in this sense: the owner had the right to give a pagan slave to the Jewish slave as a wife, even against her will; upon the liberation of the slave, she and her children remained in the possession of the owner.

However, the harsh reality was often harsher than the rabbinical legislation. Jewish slaves formed the lowest link in the Jewish social chain. In Varro's words, “the slave was a kind of tool that could speak.” Although they had a reputation for being lazy, dissolute and thieves, the truth is that the treatment and working conditions in which they worked were not the ideal framework for pretending otherwise. Perhaps the general feeling of high-ranking Jews towards slaves can be summed up in the phrases of Jesus the siracid: “The fodder, the stick and the load, for the donkey; bread, correction and work, for the servant. Make your servant work and you will have rest; give him a loose hand and he will seek freedom. As the yoke and the chains make the neck bend, so the malevolent servant whips and tortures; make him work and do not let him idle. And although the legislation that protected slaves closed the door to arbitrariness on the part of their owners, the sad reality was always the same, whether they were called by euphemisms such as servant or servant.

## The illegitimate Israelites marked with a light stain 

In this section we will examine three population groups, among which the proselytes stand out by far in number. The members of these groups have in common that their union with Levites and Israelites of pure origin was recognized as legitimate. But they could not marry into priestly families, an exclusive privilege of the Levites and full-fledged Israelites. His social position was clearly lowered; exclusion from marriage bonds with priestly families was not only a social deprivation, but also, ultimately, a religious one. In addition, these population groups were deprived of important civic rights: they had no place in certain assemblies and courts, and access to dignities was prohibited.

a) Illegitimate descendants of priests 

Among the Israelites marked with a light stain were in the first place the “profane” (_halal_, _halalah_), that is, the illegitimate children of priests. These are children born from the marriage of a priest with a woman who is not of the same condition of purity or who he cannot marry for other reasons.

An illegitimate son of a priest, like his descendants, could not exercise the priesthood; furthermore, he could not marry a priest's daughter. If an illegitimate son of a priest had a half-brother of legitimate origin, he could not, in the event that the latter died without leaving children, enter into a levirate marriage with his brother's widow, since, given his illegal origin, he was not in a position to preserve through a son the name of legitimate priest. The illegitimate daughter of a priest could not marry a legitimate priest, not even in levirate marriage. Furthermore, the widow of a _halal_, even if she was of legitimate origin, could not, according to the existing priestly law, marry a priest; by her marriage to a _halal_ she had become illegitimate herself, since its own legitimate origin did not change anything. And these prescriptions were carried out to the letter, even by the most liberal factions such as the Pharisees. However, the scribes did not approve of such prescriptions being carried out even in cases of simple suspicion, and not in complete safety. The families called _'îssah_ were priestly families in which some of their members were under suspicion for their strict purity. With these families there was a lively controversy in the time of Jesus: the Hillelite scribes were willing to accept them, while the intransigent priests unceremoniously rejected them, and at the slightest suspicion, they did not marry the daughters of these families. However, the number of this group was very small. even by the more liberal factions like the Pharisees.

However, the number of this group was very small. and at the slightest suspicion, they did not marry the daughters of these families. However, the number of this group was very small. and at the slightest suspicion, they did not marry the daughters of these families. However, the number of this group was very small.

b) Proselytes 

The proselytes were also part of the group of Israelites indicated with a light stain; they were much more numerous than the _halalim_. They are full-fledged proselytes, “proselytes of justice,” that is, pagans converted to Judaism who submitted to circumcision, baptism, and sacrificial offerings. They must be clearly distinguished from the 'God-fearers', who accepted only the monotheistic profession of faith and the observance of part of the ceremonial laws, without fully converting to Judaism. Legally they were considered as pagans.

Way back from the time of Jesus, when the Maccabees, the conversion to Judaism had been imposed by force. As we approach the time of Jesus, a current against Judaism spread throughout the geography of the Roman Empire, and conversions were increasingly rare. These conversions, however, were not rare when Jesus lived, and were formalized as such in a ritual baptism in the Siloam pool in Jerusalem.

Most of the proselytes came from the regions located on the very edge of the territory inhabited by the Jews. Some were from Idumea, others from Batanea, Auranitis and Trachonitis. It was discussed in Jewish circles whether the admission of people from Moab and Ammon as proselytes was valid. They could be people from Egypt and Edom. Many of them were from Syria (from Antioch, Palmyra...). Also from the kingdom of Adiabene, from Media, and from many other places. 

In terms of his legal status, a proselyte did not enjoy the same rights as a full-fledged Israelite. On the other hand, he was subject to the full weight of the law.

Regarding the situation of the proselyte or pagan, the following principle was rather decisive: «the pagan has no father». This legal principle reflects the extraordinarily pessimistic judgment of Rabbinic Judaism on paganism, especially in its moral life: every pagan, even a wife, is suspected of having practiced prostitution; it is doubted on principle that the pagan can know his true father.

Based on this legal basis, the legislation relating to proselytes affected marriage law in the first place: proselytes were not eligible to marry priests, although they could marry each other or other groups of the population (Levites, Israelites of pure origin or with a stain at its origin). They are also affected by the right of succession: the proselyte was allowed to appropriate, in the inheritance of his pagan father, only those objects that, such as money and harvested products, were not related to the worship of idols; another similar question was that the children and wives of the proselytes did not have the right to inherit from their father and husband even if they had converted with him. As for occupying official positions, the proselyte was prohibited from being a member of the Sanhedrin and the 23-member court,s courts (such as the one that ruled a rejection of marriage due to barefoot or _halîsah_), although in cases of property litigation. The religious rights and privileges of the chosen people were not shared by the Israelites with the proselytes. On the other hand, they did have to comply with the obligatory social aid that every good Jew was obliged to comply with those in need. 

It is worth remembering here that the Herodian royalty of the time of Jesus was all Idumean, and therefore proselyte. King Herod and his later sons, according to the Jewish law of Deut 17:15 (“You shall appoint one of your brothers as your king, you may not appoint a foreigner”), could not be legitimate monarchs. This always provoked the opposition of the Jewish people towards these rulers, and therefore, to the Romans who had forced them to put up with them.

c) Emancipated or freed pagan slaves 

Slaves obtained their freedom in accordance with norms from Roman law. The freedmen constituted the third group of the population that was part of the Israelites marked with a light stain. They are pagans and pagans by birth who, converted into slaves in the service of a Jew, had submitted, when becoming the property of the Jewish master, to circumcision and baptism of conversion, being freed later.

Emancipation could be obtained in these ways: a) by free decision of the owner, b) by rescue through other people, c) by forced emancipation, or court decision, when the owner in the presence of witnesses caused a mutilation of some part of the body, or by payment of half its value by the emancipated, d) by the death of the owner, e) by a baptism of conversion to become free. However, the real chances of a slave becoming free were slim.

The freedman who had taken the baptism of conversion was from that moment legally equal to the other full-fledged proselytes. However, the practical reality was different, since the old slavery weighed heavily morally. As an example, every emancipated slave was considered to be like a prostitute because there was no doubt about her possible sexual commerce as a slave. 

The number of freedmen was not high, and in the time of Jesus, it was even discussed whether it was propitious to allow emancipation. As for marriages, it was not uncommon for Israelite women to marry these freedmen, for they were only considered to be Israelites with a slight blemish. But the reality was that they were the last social stratum considered Jewish, and therefore highly despised. 

## Illegitimate Israelites marked with a grave stain

The Israelites marked with a light stain were not allowed to marry those belonging to priestly families and leaders, but those who had a serious stain, as we are going to see, were not allowed with any social stratum, not even with the above. They were considered the trash of the community and despised in such a way that their only way of life was to isolate themselves in closed communities and not mix with the rest of the people. 

a) bastards

They are the _mamzer_ (pl. _mamzerîm_). In general terms, they were all those born from a union prohibited in the Torah, mainly from incest and adultery. But some rabbis had extended the idea to other cases, such as the son of the union with a _halûsah_ (or childless widow whose brother-in-law did not accept by leviratic marriage), or with her relatives, or with the divorced woman who does not have the divorce paper in order. However, these last cases were not unanimously accepted and an opinion more limited to incest and adultery was usually adopted. 

The population group that these _mamzer_ constituted, including their descendants, was important. People marked with the grave stain were well known, though naturally they tried to hide their stain.

As for their legal status, they were not admitted to the Jewish community, nor were their descendants until the tenth generation, that is, almost without limits. This prevented the _mamzer_ from marrying, even levirate, with the families of the priests, Levites, Israelites and illegitimate children of priests; bastards could marry only into families of proselytes, emancipated slaves, and severely tainted Israelites. If the daughter of a priest, a Levite or a legitimate Israelite married a bastard, she was henceforth unfit for marriage with a priest. Every child of any such union was a bastard; It was the same with every descendant of a bastard.

The bastards had no access to public dignities; his participation in a court invalidated the decision. He was only allowed to participate in the courts of three for civil cases. 

You have to think that the stain of the bastard marked all male descendants forever, and indelibly, it was discussed whether the families of bastards would participate in the final liberation of Israel. Thus it will be understood that the word “bastard” was one of the worst insults, and that whoever used it was punished with 39 lashes. 

b) Temple slaves, children of unknown father, foundlings, eunuchs

The temple slaves, _natînîm_, were also part of the group of Israelites marked with a serious stain on their origin. This was because according to the scriptures these temple servants were originally Gibeonites, and therefore not Jews. There was a ban on having sex with them. 

The fatherless and foundlings were suspected of being bastards, treated as such, and subjected to the same segregation as everyone else. 

Los eunucos tampoco eran aceptados en la comunidades Israel. No podían formar parte de cargos ni podían establecer matrimonios fuera de su rango. Eran un grupo numeroso sobre todo en la corte del rey y su harén.

## The pagan slaves 

This social group was in a special intermediate situation: it was in very close relations with the Jewish community, but, nevertheless, it was not counted in it. Their position regarding Hebrew law was much worse than that of the Jewish slaves.

It is false that slavery was not in use at the time of Jesus. Certainly, in the Palestine of that time the existence of industries that employed a large number of slaves was not confirmed; nor are there hardly any estates cultivated by slaves on a large scale. But we certainly find domestic slaves of heathen origin in large numbers in the houses of the notables of Jerusalem. We must remember here first of all the Herodian court, then the houses of the priestly nobility, where there were also many slaves.

Slaves of both sexes were bought or born in the house. It could be that the slave traders, who brought their 'merchandise' to the Jerusalem slave market, came mainly from Phenicia. Many of these slaves came from Arabia, as the number of Arab prisoners of war captured by the Jews in the course of Herod's wars was high.

The price of slaves varied greatly according to age, sex, bodily and spiritual qualities or defects. Circumstances also exerted their influence: periods of war increased supply and lowered prices; in times of peace, they rose. In the Roman period, under Augustus, prices had risen considerably. These could range from 500 drachmas (5 minae) to over 100,000 sesterces (over 150 minae). In the first century before ours, the average price was therefore about 20 mines, and in the first century of our era, 30 mines. In Palestine, the prices also underwent great variations: during the Maccabean struggles the price was ridiculous and then it goes up a lot, up to 100 mines, which, compared to the current price outside Palestine, represents a relatively lower slave price. This is doubtless due to the fact that in Palestine the luxury slaves, men (eunuchs, learned people) and women (citarists, hetairas), for whom the highest prices were paid, did not play a great role. The price of 20 mines will offer an idea of ​​its important sum if we compare it with the average salary of a day laborer at that time, which was one denarius. The price of 20 mines (2,000 denarii), therefore, corresponded to 2,000 times the daily wage of a worker. A slave, male or female, therefore represented a very considerable value.

The price of 20 mines (2,000 denarii), therefore, corresponded to 2,000 times the daily wage of a worker. A slave, male or female, therefore represented a very considerable value.

A description of the social situation of the slaves must start from the fact that they were the total property of their owner. The slave could not own any property; it is his owner who receives the fruit of his work, and what he finds, what is given to him, what he receives in compensation for an injury or a humiliation suffered, in a word: everything that is his, even his children, belongs to its owner. Like any other object owned, it can be sold, given away, given as collateral, declared sacred, and constitutes a part of the inheritance. This situation, like wherever slavery reigned, brought with it above all that male slaves were deprived of protection against mistreatment, punishment, services, and that female slaves had to submit to the sexual whims of their owners. Nevertheless,

Pagan slaves of both sexes who became the property of a Jew were required to take a ritual baptism to become slaves. If the slave was female, this baptism meant conversion to Judaism; male slaves were required to perform this conversion by also undergoing circumcision. 

The pagan slave was a servant, but circumcised; that explains the equivocal and special situation in which he found himself. By circumcision he was a “son of the covenant,” but since he was a freedman, he was not a member of the community of Israel.

As for the religious duties that were incumbent on him, the slave had to obey only the precepts that were not related to a specific moment, since he was not the owner of his time. The slave, therefore, was freed from reciting the _semá_, from wearing the phylacteries, from going on pilgrimage for the festivals of Easter, Pentecost and Tabernacles, from living in the tents and waving the lûlab and from blowing the horn at the New Year festival. New. On the contrary, he was obliged to pray at the table after the meal and to the daily recitation of the “eighteen blessings”, as well as to place the _mezuza_ on the door.

The religious and civic rights that the slave obtained with his conversion to Judaism were limited. The advantages of the Jewish religious laws did not affect the slave except to the extent that the rights of his owner were not prejudiced. In the first place, he had the same right to Sabbath rest as every Israelite; he had the right to participate in the Passover festival, including the Passover banquet. Finally, the owner of it had no right to sell it to a heathen. The rights that a slave obtained with his conversion were more or less reduced to this. In the rest he had no rights. In the first place, from the religious point of view he could not, for example, neither lay hands on the head of the victim in the temple nor shake the portions of it; in the synagogue he could not be counted to complete the figure of ten present, I couldn't do the reading, nor do the blessing at the meal. He had no right to testify as a witness. Finally, he was deprived of all rights from the matrimonial point of view. A slave, male or female, was unable to contract a valid marriage with any kind of Israelite, even with whom he was marked with a very serious stain; the child born from the union of an Israelite with a slave was (like the mother), a slave and belonged to the owner of the slave. As far as marriage law was concerned, therefore, slaves of both sexes, despite their conversion to Judaism, were still regarded as pagans. he was incapable of entering into a valid marriage with any kind of Israelite, even one marked with a very serious stain; the child born from the union of an Israelite with a slave was (like the mother), a slave and belonged to the owner of the slave.

As far as marriage law was concerned, therefore, slaves of both sexes, despite their conversion to Judaism, were still regarded as pagans.

Simply put, pagan slaves were not Jews and had no essential Jewish rights, although they had to behave as if they were. 

It is necessary to have before our eyes this social situation, which made the word “slave” one of the worst insults punished with anathema, to understand the indignation that Jesus provoked in some of his listeners by calling them “slaves of tradition”.

# The great sanhedrin of Jerusalem and other Jewish courts 

## The Jerusalem Sanhedrin

The great Jerusalem Sanhedrin was basically an administrative council made up of seventy members whose functions were basically legislative (promulgating laws, mostly of a civic-religious nature) and judicial (resolving important legal cases and acting as the supreme Jewish court or _beit dyn_ ). But the executive power did not compete with him, which the Jews normally preferred to fall into the hands of a legitimate king, which, however, happened in a few periods of Jewish history. The reality is that the Jews never considered their kings very important because their state was a theocracy, where they considered God as king, and therefore the dignitary with the greatest weight for the Jews was the high priest, who was believed to show in their decisions the designs of God.

The Jewish sages wanted to trace its origin back to a council of seventy elders that Moses supposedly surrounded himself with, but historical data confirms that such a council of seventy elders was a reality long after Moses and that the reference in Nm 11 16 was a later interpolation of the Rabbis. Its real origin must be sought at the time of the Persian domination, in which the Jews enjoyed a certain freedom in their religious affairs, and it was then that a council was organized, made up of nobles or dignitaries (_horym or saganym_) to decide on religious affairs, although nothing is known of their number or organization, and the number of seventy was not yet established.

The Hellenistic influence that the Jewish state received after the Persian period, which normally established two typical democratic institutions as administrative bodies in the cities, the _ecclesía_ or assembly and the _boulé_ or council, was not so much felt in Jewish territory. Here the ancient council of nobles or elders, called by this time _gerousía_, still continued in force with full power, since the Greeks also left much freedom in internal affairs to their conquered. This gerousía is clearly constituted by priests and its constitution is not democratic, but hereditary. Only a few priestly families from prominent lineages were part of this council.

In the Roman period, Gabinius (57-55 BC) divided the Jewish territory into five _synedria_ or administrative regions, three of them, Jerusalem, Gazara and Jericho, located in Judea and under the influence of Jerusalem. Surely from this time dates the time when the council or _gerousía_ of Jerusalem was also called _synedrion_, a name that lasted despite the fact that only ten years after Gabinius the divisional system of the synedria was dissolved when Caesar handed over the entire territory to the ethnarch Hyrcanus II. The importance of this court in Jerusalem is evident from the fact that King Herod, when he took office as king, had all or practically all of his members executed and had them replaced by more docile members.

In the time of Jesus, beside the usual appellation of _synedrion_ for the supreme Jewish court, the terms _presbyterion_, _gerousia_, _boulé_, _beit dyn hagadol_ (the great court), _sanhedrin gadol_ (the great sanhedrin), and _sanhedrin sl sb ym-w'hd_ (the Sanhedrin of the seventy-first).

At the time of Jesus the Sanhedrin was made up of a mixture of Sadducees (priests and laymen), aristocrats and wise Pharisees, and consisted of seventy-one members. This number of seventy-one was a common number in the administrative councils of many cities of the time. Within the Sanhedrin there were three categories, from highest to lowest importance: the high priests (_archiereis_), the nobles or aristocrats (_arcontes_, _bouletes_ or _dygnatoi_), and the sages or rabbis (_grammateis_ or _presbiteroi_). The high priests were almost always Sadducees while the wise men were usually Pharisees. The power of the latter increased over time, especially after the time of Jesus, but in the time of Jesus both religious parties shared power halfway, neither group had pre-eminence in court. It seems that within the Sanhedrin, the ten most prominent members once served as spokesmen and were called _deca protoi_, in the style of the committee of the same name that was frequently found among Greek cities.

Absolutely nothing is known of how a vacant post was filled, but it was certainly not done in a democratic way, as in the Greek councils. Here surely the members held the position for life and the new members were chosen for the position among several candidates by vote of their current members. Applicants were required to master rabbinical learning and be pure, legitimate Israelites by birth, and the admission ceremony was the “laying on of hands” (_smykt ydyn_) or “ordination.” The president of the sanhedrin or _proedros_, who was the high priest, placed his hands on the head of the admitted pronouncing some phrase granting powers.

The civil authority of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin was restricted in Jesus' time to the eleven toparchies or regions into which Judea was divided. That is why he had no jurisdiction over Jesus while he was in Galilee or other regions. However, he had a high moral influence on the councils and synagogues of the entire Jewish world, although he could not force any institution in his determinations. It was a competent court to make judicial decisions and administrative measures of all kinds, except what was the competence of the superior courts or was reserved to the Roman governor. This was not a final court of appeal if you disagree with a lower court's ruling. At that time the appeal did not exist. When a court ruled, its decision was irrevocable.

The serious cases that were reserved for the judgment of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin were those related to the judgment of a whole group of people, such as an entire city, or when it came to judging a false prophet or the high priest himself. But at the time of Jesus, the Roman authority was ultimately the executor of death sentence cases in Jewish territory for any of the above cases. A certain independence of the lower courts, which could execute capital punishment in certain cases (for example, an adulterous woman could be stoned to death, since it was a minor case of local jurisdiction), was usual, but the case of Jesus, for example, who was considered a false prophet, could be sentenced only by the Jerusalem Sanhedrin, but the sentence could not be carried out by him. For these capital cases, Rome had the last word. Augustus had determined in the eastern provinces, through the fourth edict of Cyrene (7/6 BC) that capital cases would be reserved for the governor. This was not the norm of the Empire, because in other provinces there was more distribution of powers.

The Sanhedrin therefore had certain powers to make arrests, and had its own police force, could try criminal cases, and carry out minor sentences other than capital cases, such as the execution of a religious teacher. Emperor Augustus had enacted a policy of permissiveness towards all non-degrading religious forms, and the Roman Empire, following this doctrine, protected all religions. The Jerusalem Sanhedrin, falling under Roman jurisdiction, thus lost the right to annul the religious initiative and to coerce religious freedom in its territory.

The meetings of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin could not take place on the Sabbath or the day before the Sabbath or holiday, since a sentence could not be passed until the day after the trial. The place where he met, called the _bouleyterion_ or _liskat ha-gazyt_, was a room outside the temple compound, along the western wall. It was a construction made by normal architectural means, and that is why it was also called the hall of carved stones or ashlars as a distinctive feature, because it was not usual for the high priests to celebrate in a place where the stone had been carved. The temple was built with rough stones.

In a trial the members of the court sat in a semicircle, from which it must be assumed that the room with the carved stones had seats forming a C. In front sat the two court clerks, who took notes of the accusations and arguments in favor of the accused. Behind it were three rows of seats where the rabbi students could sit to listen to the trials. The accused had to adopt a humble posture, wear loose hair and wear black clothes. First, the arguments in favor were made and the witnesses who spoke favorably of the accused were brought, then the opposing party was heard. In capital cases, the students, who could ask questions, could only act in favor, but not against. In all other cases, they could act in defense or against the prisoner. The acquittal sentences could be dictated the same day of the trial. A simple majority vote was sufficient in this case. A majority of at least two was required for a conviction in the lower courts, which were made up of twenty-three members, but in the case of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin, of seventy-one members, there was no possibility of equality. The simple majority determined the verdict. there was no chance of equality. The simple majority determined the verdict. there was no chance of equality. The simple majority determined the verdict.

## Other minor courts 

The Jerusalem Sanhedrin could not deal with all the cases that could arise, as it was only one court, so it was logical that it had the support of other minor courts to which it delegated part of its functions. Specifically, there was talk of the existence in Jerusalem of two other minor courts called “the court of the gate of the temple mount”, in the first instance, then the court of the “court of the temple”, in the second instance. If neither of them achieves unanimity in a given case, then it was lawful to take the case to the supreme court.

The large cities of the Jewish land all had courts or lesser Sanhedrins (_sanhedrins qtnh_), consisting of twenty-three members, and with jurisdiction over certain types of cases, including some death penalty cases. For example, they could execute an adulteress. The Jerusalem Sanhedrin was, therefore, for the cases that have already been seen and for cases that occurred in Jerusalem and its surrounding villages that the lower courts of the city had not been able to rule on. It is possible that the great Jewish capitals even had courts consisting of seventy-one members. These courts or councils were constituted in the same way as the one in Jerusalem and their functions, constitution and procedures were to be similar,


## The influence of Jewish institutions on the Jesus movement 

It should not be taken for granted that Jesus' intention in creating his evangelical movement was to form the Christian institution as we see it today. Christianity is much more pagan and gentile than what Jesus initially organized. Actually, from the study of the gospels, an influence of the Jewish organization of that time can be seen in the way the incipient Jesus movement was organized:

* Jesus forms a group of twelve outstanding disciples, to whom he gives the title of apostles, a non-Jewish word, of Greek origin, which designated a royal messenger or envoy. Curiously, the number twelve, of great Jewish importance, imitates a council of twelve outstanding men that apparently existed in Jewish antiquity when there were twelve tribes. Each male was the maximum representative of each tribe. Apparently, the followers of Jesus saw in this number twelve a symbolism in this sense. They believed that Jesus closed the number at twelve because they considered that the apostles would act as representatives of the twelve tribes of Israel when the world reached its fullness in the immediate end of time. However, the end of the world did not come and the accent of the Christian organization passed from the East to the West, and the number of apostles did not seem suitable to limit to twelve in a Roman setting. Today, the synod of bishops, current equivalent of the twelve apostles of Jesus, obviously does not present the limitation of this number.
* The procedure by which Jesus invests his twelve outstanding disciples as apostles is the same rite of “laying on of hands” (smykt ydyn) or “ordination” that was already practiced by the members of the Sanhedrin in his day. This ceremony has been perpetuated until today. Christianity modified it in its initial Jewish sense considering it the rite by which the holy spirit was communicated. But it would be convenient to analyze if Jesus really practiced the imposition of hands as a customary rite and because he wanted his followers to follow the same practice, or if it was a rite performed very occasionally and to mark special moments. From reading _The Urantia Book_ one gets the feeling that Jesus never attached much importance to ways and means of celebrating rituals, and I doubt that, as some scholars point out,
* Jesus organized a group of seventy evangelists or disciples commissioned to evangelize, who acted for several months led by the twelve apostles (Lk 10:1-24). This number again seems to be taken following the example of the high Jewish courts, formed by a similar number of members. Even the denomination of some members of the Sanhedrin (_presbyters_, for example), remained in the Christian church. But did Jesus appoint seventy evangelists because this number represented some special criteria, or was it just chance?
* The way in which in Acts 1:21-26 Matthias' appointment as Judas's successor is told to us also seems to follow a Jewish way of thinking. It was not carried out democratically, but was drawn by lot. The Jews considered “casting lots” a way of consulting the divine plan. It seems that the mode of succession in the group of apostles was in the line of the Sanhedrin.

# The emoluments of the Hebrew priesthood

After the period of the Jewish people in exile and until Hellenistic times the undisputed leadership group in Israel were the priests. They organized the new community, they perpetuated the teachings of the Torah and in their hands was the spiritual and material direction of the community.

Gradually, with the passage of time, the group of scribes or teachers was formed alongside the group of priests, especially from the period of the Maccabees. However, although this meant a reduction in the power of the priests in terms of leadership in the teaching of the Torah, it did not mean any setback in the rest of their powers. The priests, from time immemorial, were the only ones authorized to perform the temple sacrifices. They were a very closed group. Only those who could prove concrete ancestry, inheriting from the legendary Aaron, could be admitted as a priest. That achieved the necessary survival of the priests despite their loss of authority in legal and educational matters.

The only temple admitted by the Jews was that of Jerusalem, a peculiarity that distinguished them from the rest of the world's peoples, which centralized and granted enormous power to the few priests who had to attend this central temple of the Jewish faith. All sacrificial offerings, of which the priests received a part, had to be made in the temple in Jerusalem, and could not be made at a distance. That concentration of power notably benefited the priestly community, which was always a privileged group in the status of the Jewish groups.

The need to ensure legitimate descent meant very strict and rigorous legislation regarding which marriages were valid for a priest. There were records in Jerusalem where the detailed genealogy of each priest was recorded, and any aspiring priest had to take great care that these records were kept up to date and without errors. 

Despite the strictness, priests could marry women who were not daughters of priests as long as they were not prostitutes, women without virginity, divorced or prisoners of war (they were considered without further suspicion of having been raped). They could, yes, marry a widow, but only in certain circumstances. All these careful rules have their origin in the book of Leviticus (Lev 21:7-8).

The reason for all this madness about genealogical ancestry is in the sacred character that the Jews granted to their priests. They were special people, who could not be in contact with anything that caused ritual impurity. Their rites in the temple were the only ones that the Jewish people performed, so they were required to perform them in a state of extreme purity. If the Pharisees were legalists to death on these issues, the priests were three times more so. Their obsession with the issue of purity reached such a point that they never attended funeral ceremonies. The potential contact with a corpse would have made them unable to perform their rituals, which is why a Jewish priest would never officiate at a funeral. Furthermore, they did not even participate in mourning ceremonies for a close family member. In short:

Priestly purity included not only potential contact with impure things, but also any physical problems of the priest himself. Diseases, deformities, skin blemishes, dozens of things could disable a priest, either temporarily or permanently. Of course, they always maintained their status as priests throughout their lives and continued to receive their share of profits from the temple. 

It is not known exactly at what age someone could begin their exercise of the priesthood, but it is estimated that it was at least twenty years old. The applicant was carefully examined, his genealogies were verified, both by his father and mother, and if he was finally considered fit, the act of consecration was performed.

This rite lasted a total of seven days and consisted (Ex 29, Lv 8) in a purification bath or baptism, the delivery of the sacred garments and a series of ritual sacrifices. Certain parts of the aspirant's body were to be sprinkled with sacrificial blood, as well as his garments. Blood, let us not forget, was considered the essential element for the total cleansing of the individual, since it eliminated sins. Another rite consisted of the “filling of hands,” that is, placing a portion of the sacrificed animal in the hands of the aspirant. The rite of anointing seems to have been reserved for the high priest alone.

Even though there was only one temple to attend to, and the number of Jewish priests was very low compared to the number of priests in other religions at that time, it was still high enough that they could not all officiate together. For that reason they were divided into twenty-four families or shifts. Only four priestly families returned from exile in Babylon (Ezra 10:18-22), but later these families were divided into groups and they shared which days each one would attend in the temple.

Each of the twenty-four sections was in turn divided into others. Their number varied from five to nine for each shift. The main sections are given the general designation of _mhlqwt_ (classes) or _byt `bwt_ (houses of fathers) in that each was made up of a family, or _msmrwt_ (watchmen) in that they were responsible for the service of the temple. In Greek the main divisions were called _patria_, _efimeria_ or _efimeris_ and the subdivisions _fulí_. The heads of shifts and subdivisions were called _srym_ or _r`sym_, or also _r`s hmsmr_.

Not all shifts had the same prestige. Jojarib's turn, from which the high priests and the Hasmonean princes came, had an advantage. The families from which the high priests came had more weight and authority than the families of minor priests. The economic and social differences between some families of priests and others were very great. The privileged families lived in opulence, while some priests, restricted in their remuneration, could end up being destitute. No wonder the poor priests supported the revolt against Rome when it came, when the wealthy priestly families were all against it.

Originally the Levites were nothing more than priests and priestly families who performed rituals outside the temple in Jerusalem. When all ritual was prohibited except that of Jerusalem, then the foreign priests began to be called Levites to distinguish them from the priests of Jerusalem. From now on, they could no longer carry out their activity outside the holy city. Finally the legislation established this distinction and it was registered (Num 18:7). The priests could officiate at the altar and the sanctuary, while the Levites would perform the other services of the tabernacle, such as slaughtering and preparing the sacrificial victims, but never access the altar or the interior of the sanctuary.

For real purposes the Levites were like a caste of priests. They also formed a closed group, they also had to prove a genealogical ancestry, in this case as supposed heirs of Levi, one of the twelve patriarchs of Israel, and they also had to comply with a rigorous system of marriages and consignment in the records of their offspring. . Similarly they had a division in tours of duty. Initially very few returned from exile, but over time they acquired the same division into twenty-four groups as the priests. Over time, and especially around the time of Jesus and later, the Levites became divided into three groups: Levites in general, temple singers, and gatekeepers. Each with its own organization into twenty-four groups,

Both priests and Levites did not live only in Jerusalem. The number of the families residing in the holy city must have been no more than a fifth of the entire number of priests and Levites who were distributed throughout the different cities of Judea, Perea, Galilee, and other regions. 

Originally the amounts received by the priests were very precarious. With the passage of time, the divine character that was granted to the priestly function made them take on such importance that even the scribes, who often distrusted them, could not prevent the taxes or tithes that were granted to them from ending up grow up.

In Jesus' time the priests were entitled to obtain the following earnings from all members of the Jewish people: from sacrifices, from payments in kind for agricultural products, and from payments in kind for livestock products. 

## I. Sacrifices 

In the first place, they obtained the totality of the expiatory and penitential sacrifices. The fat of the animals was burned on the altar, but all the meat passed to the priests. This in ancient times was the other way around. An offering was made on the altar, but all the meat was consumed by the offerer in a ritual banquet as part of the offering.

Second, the grain offerings also went almost entirely to the priests since only a small part was burned on the altar. These offerings were quite frequent, although the opposite might be expected. They used to be offered by individuals, but it turns out that they were a complementary sacrifice that had to be made obligatorily every time an animal sacrifice was made. 

Third, the showbread, bread that had to be renewed every week, was also for the priests. It was not a large amount, but it was also for them. 

These three emoluments were earnings of the priests, but they were considered “most holy” and could only be consumed within the temple and only by them, not by relatives.

Then there were what were known as “thanksgiving sacrifices” or “communion sacrifices,” in which the offerer had to consume a portion. The priests perceived the chest and the right shoulder, a not insignificant part of each animal, but it could also be consumed by them and by their relatives outside the temple. 

Finally, there were the sacrifices called “holocausts”, which were those that were burned completely on the altar, and from which the priests took only the skins, the least profit. Although when you think about the number of animals that were slaughtered in a year, it was a really juicy income. 

## II. Payments in kind of agricultural products

The sacrifices, although they already represented a good amount for the priests, since they provided them with good amounts of meat, grain and skins, and some of these things could be sold outside the temple, they were only a small fraction of their profits. The bulk of their earnings came from payments in kind or equivalent money made apart from the sacrifices.

One of the most important payments was the first fruits or _bikurim_. The so-called “seven species” were offered, that is, the most cultivated in Palestine: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives and honey. Delivery used to take place in summer. The starting point of the period in which they could be delivered was marked by _Shavuot_, Pentecost, and there was enough time until _Sucot_, the Tabernacles. People used to take it in a very festive way because it was not for nothing that it represented a celebration of having managed to finish the exhausting harvest. Those who lived near Jerusalem brought the product fresh, and those who lived far away brought it dried. They used to form a procession led by a bull destined for a communion sacrifice, with golden horns and crowned with olive branches. The procession was solemnly received by the priests, who guided the locals to the temple to deliver their baskets and baskets. An entire Mishnah treatise was devoted to detailing these _bikurim_. The firstfruits were not only a considerable amount of the harvest that was placed in the hands of the priests (an amount difficult to quantify), but also the best part, the first fruits, and therefore, the freshest and highest quality. This evidently allowed the priests to resell that product at a substantial profit. The firstfruits were not only a considerable amount of the harvest that was placed in the hands of the priests (an amount difficult to quantify), but also the best part, the first fruits, and therefore, the freshest and highest quality. This evidently allowed the priests to resell that product at a substantial profit. The firstfruits were not only a considerable amount of the harvest that was placed in the hands of the priests (an amount difficult to quantify), but also the best part, the first fruits, and therefore, the freshest and highest quality. This evidently allowed the priests to resell that product at a substantial profit.

Another of the most important payments to the priests was the _terumah_, which was the fiftieth part of everything produced, not only of the important species. This two percent of the field's production represented another large benefit for the clergy.

But the largest and most important payment of all was the tithe. Once the previous offerings of the _bikurim_ and the _terumah_ were separated from everything else, the farmer had to reserve the tenth part that would be taken to Jerusalem. The gospels explain very well to what extent the clergy took the delivery of this payment seriously. All products, even the least valuable, had the obligation to suffer the tithe. Even products like mint, dill and cumin, of little benefit, had to be paid for (Mt 23:23; Lk 11:42). The large income from this concept was not intended, however, directly for the priests. It was in the first place for the Levites, who otherwise would not see a single income, but indirectly the Levites had to give a tenth to the priests.

Even worse was the situation for the long-suffering taxpayers of Jesus' time if we think that after separating that tithe they still had to separate a second tithe or _maaser shení_. This, at least, was not intended directly for the priests or Levites. It was an amount that was to be consumed in Jerusalem during the festivals. Many pious Jews used this second tithe to make sacrifices and offerings, so if not all of it, a good part ended up in the hands of the clergy as well.

The last payment was called “mass offering” or _hallah_. It applied to wheat, barley, spelt, oats and rye. The offering was not to be made in the form of flour but dough. It represented one twenty-fourth of the harvest of these products for an individual farmer, and one fortieth if he was a baker. 

## III. Payments in kind of livestock products

The ancient legislation established that the firstborn male of the animals should be given as a sacrifice to God. Later this legislation was modified saying that it should be put in the hands of the priests. Furthermore, although there was no such legislation for human firstborns, it was established that the children had to be ransomed from the sacrifice by paying a tax (called a `ransom'), which also went to the priests. 

So we had the following income for the priests:

* The first-born male of the so-called “pure cattle”, that is, especially bulls, rams and goats, was delivered in kind. If the animal was found pure, that is, without any stains or defects, it was considered “holy”, it was sacrificed on the altar, its blood was sprinkled on the altar, the fat was burned there, but the rest of the animal, the most substantial and useful part passed to the priests. If the animal presented some defect and could not be considered worthy of the altar, then the priests rubbed their hands even more, since the animal passed to them intact.
* The male first-born of the so-called “impure” species, that is, the horse, the donkey and the camel, had to be redeemed by paying a tax, according to Josephus of a shekel and a half. The payment in shekels had the advantage for the priests that it was a currency only used in the temple, and therefore it had to be exchanged, and in exchange the priests returned to get a percentage of benefit.
* In the case of a child, the first male child in a family was to be “ransomed” at the age of one month by paying five shekels. It was not necessary to present the child in the temple, as is often thought when reading Lk 2:22. This rate was inexcapable. Every family, whether rich or poor, was obligated to her without exception. If we think that 5 shekels were approximately 20 denarii, and that a denarius was equivalent to a day's wages for a day laborer in the field, the “rescue” of the firstborn male of a poor family could leave it in the most miserable poverty. 

In the case of animals that were sacrificed in the temple for whatever reason, then the priests had the right to keep three portions of the entire animal: the shoulder, the two jaws and the curdle.

Finally, the priests were also entitled to another part of the livestock income: those from shearing. The minimum number of sheep, between two and five, to participate in this tax, made its application lighter for poor families that only had a few animals. But everyone else had to give five _sela_ from Judea, or ten from Galilee to satisfy this tax [^1]. 

## IV. extraordinary offerings

The emoluments of the priests did not end in all of the above. Another series of offerings could still be delivered in the temple, of which the priests received a part. An individual could consecrate himself, and in order to “ransom” himself he would deliver a payment. It was a significant amount: 50 shekels for a man and 30 for a woman. Animals, houses and plots of land could also be consecrated. The animals could be given in kind, but the properties, again, were only given in money. 

The anathema, which was a votive offering that could not be redeemed, remained intact for the priests.

Lastly, stolen or illicitly acquired goods, when it was impossible to return them to their rightful owners, were money that the priests kept with them. That is why we see Judas Iscariot returning the coins of the payment of his betrayal in the temple. He does not consider that he has legally acquired those coins. 

## V. The half shekel

The annual half-shekel (or the two drachmas or denarii) that every Jew was obliged to pay to the priests to support the temple was no longer something oriented towards the performance of a cultic rite. It was a plain and simple tax that was introduced in recent times. In ancient times, the maintenance and costs of the temple were borne by the king. But later it was added as an obligation of Jewish citizens. It is mentioned in the gospel (Mt 17:24) and every male Israelite twenty years of age or older, whether rich or poor, was obliged to pay it, and he had to pay it necessarily in the “official” currency of Tyre. The time fixed for making the payment was the month of Adar (February-March), and the method followed was by means of a collector who went to each community collecting the collection and then sending it to Jerusalem.

## SAW. The offering of firewood 

Another annual tax that is made in the middle of the month of ab was for firewood to be able to maintain the altar of holocausts. Each family contributed what they could and any type of firewood was allowed, except olive and vine. 

## VII. freewill offerings

It was not uncommon for many devout Jews, aside from all annual obligations, to still contribute donations to the temple. The offering of objects to be used as ornaments in the temple was frequent, especially in the form of clusters of gold to adorn the portal of the temple, or to plate doors in gold. Even donations from gentiles were admitted. In the gospels we have the story of a poor old woman who contributed her few coins to the temple treasury (Mk 12: 41-44; Lk 22: 1-4) in one of the thirteen chests with trumpet-shaped mouths that served to cover some liturgical expenses. The priests also received a good part of that money, since they kept part of the sacrificial animals that were bought with that money.

This concludes the series of concepts by which the priests and the Levites received their income. What is not clear to experts is whether this income was contributed by all Jews, including those living in foreign Roman provinces, or only by the inhabitants of the holy land. Of course, no foreigner came to Jerusalem with goods in kind unless the distance to the city was short. The normal thing is that the contributions of the Jews of the diaspora were in money. 

## Notes 

[^1]: A _sela_ of Judea was equivalent to two shekels of the temple, but if it was the usual currency of Galilee, since it was minted with less silver, it was necessary to pay more

# The fishing sector in the Sea of ​​Galilee 

## Importance of the Sea of ​​Galilee for Jewish fishing

The Jewish territory hardly had access to the sea. The Dead Sea was not suitable for fishing, and from the vast Gaza Strip and the Mediterranean coast to Phenicia, none of the important fishing ports remained under Jewish influence for long. Of Gaza Maiumas, Antedon, Ashkelon, Ashdod Paralios, Jamnia Paralios, Joppa, Apollonia Sozusa, Caesarea Maritima, and Dora, only Joppa can be considered a Jewish port, since in the rest its inhabitants are almost all Greeks or Gentiles. Therefore, in Jerusalem, the so-called Fish Gate (Neh 3:3) was so called because it used to be the place where the Phoenician merchants from Tire and the Phoenician coast used to sell their product.

All this caused the Sea of ​​Galilee, the region's small freshwater lake, to become an industrial fishing center of great importance to the Jewish world, as fish caught by Jewish fishermen was preferred and guaranteed to he would comply with the rabbinical precepts of alimentary purity and he would avoid the fish called impure, as opposed to the fish by the gentile fishermen. However, the fact of the existence of the Fish Gate in Jerusalem as the location of the Tyrian fishermen means that the fishing of the Sea of ​​Galilee did not provide all the catches necessary to supply Galilee, Judea, Perea and the rest of the world. territories under Jewish influence, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem had to accept the consumption of fish from Gentile cities.

The importance of the fishing sector in the economy of the Sea of ​​Galilee is evidenced by the names of toponyms, many of them with reference to this sector. Betsaida, the population that scholars discuss whether it was one or two, means village or house (_bet_) of fishermen (_saidan_). Tariquea, the town that many scholars today identify with Magdala (erroneously, as we have seen in another article), means “place of conservation of fish”. In fact, the Sea of ​​Galilee, in the time of Jesus, is also called “sea of ​​tariqueas”, because the products derived from the drying of fish produced in the lake were world famous. 

## Fishing ports at the time

During a prolonged drought in the 1980s, Sea of ​​Galilee scholar Mendel Nun was able to identify the remains of ancient jetties from the time of Jesus. What is striking about these discoveries is that the Sea of ​​Galilee appeared to be practically covered along its entire coast by these piers. This suggests that next to the waters of the sea there were, almost without solution of continuity, a large number of small and large populations dedicated to fishing. Some of these populations were, however, a smaller population or village associated with another more important population, on which it depended, but which was located inland. This last case corresponded to the port of Hippos and Gadara, two independent city-states of the Decapolis with a large _chora_ or territory under their jurisdiction, that occupied a wide swath of the eastern lake. Continuing from here, clockwise, we have the following towns: Tariquea was the furthest south, located at the mouth of the lake in the Jordan River; A little further north was Senabris, and then Hammat, the latter place highly appreciated for its hot springs; then there was the new city of Herod Antipas, Tiberias or Tiberias; to the north of Tiberias was Magdala; on the north face of the lake were the populations of Genesaret, Bethsaida and Capernaum; it is possible that near the mouth of the Jordan there was a small village called Aish; crossing the Jordan we passed into the territory of the Gaulanitide by paying a fee at the required customs; there, a few kilometers away we find its capital, called Betsaida-Julias (it was called in times Betsaida but was renamed as Julias); to the south of Bethsaida-Julias, occupying the eastern coast, there were three other towns: Kefar Aqbiya, Queresa and Ein Gofra.

As can be seen, they added up to a total of fifteen ports, a not insignificant amount if we consider that the Sea of ​​Galilee only had a perimeter of 50 km (today it has about 53 km but at the time of Jesus the sea level was lower than current and the coastline was less extensive). 

## Economic model of the fishing sector at the time of Jesus

The productive economy of Jesus' time in the Roman Empire was not a free market economy, but a controlled market economy. No industrial activity could be carried out without receiving state authorization, either from the emperor himself or from his subordinates (whether they were governors or client-kings). Farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and artisans were all subject to a hierarchical scale of powers in which those at the top of the pyramid brought together all rights to control rates and leases, and progressively, along an endless succession From intermediaries, it reached the worker or salaried worker and the slave, the lowest in the hierarchy.

In these economies, the final peasant and artisan has no voice or vote in the allocation of taxes, which is left entirely to the free whim of the top leaders. For this proletariat, the only way out is to submit to this rigid system, or else evade taxes through lies or anonymity. However, a strict census system made it difficult to evade these taxes. In this situation, technological innovation was meaningless, since greater production also increased the contribution to the treasury in the same proportion. The only innovation allowed in terms of public constructions, roads, canals, ports, or war material, served the sole purpose of aggrandizing wealthy families, but hardly benefited small workers.

Focusing on the fishing sector, under the governors and client-kings (in the time of Jesus Pontius Pilate and the other prefects of Judea, as well as the kings Herod Antipas and Herod Philip), the following organization was arranged: 

* First Ultimately, these rulers auctioned the rights to collect taxes and leasehold rights to the “chief tax collectors” or _architelônai_. They were very wealthy people, because they had to be able to advance large sums, and they acted as bankers, but they were also in charge of leasing their rights to the following. Each ruled a region or _toparchy_. In Galilee there were four: Tarichea, Gabara, Tiberias, and Sepphoris.
* Secondly, the chief collectors sold their rights to second-class collectors, who were in charge of the collections: rental or leasing of rights to carry out an industrial activity (for example, in order to fish, one had to pay a fee or a fishing license to a port chief, who authorized a family to fish); fees to canning factories to be able to carry out their activity; tolls for carriers at ports and roads, especially when changing jurisdiction or for the use of an imperial road; finally, the merchants had to pay taxes that allowed the sale of the products to the consumer. In these tax collectors we must exclude those who collected the obligatory tax for the temple of Jerusalem (Mt 17:24) and other religious taxes that were required of all Jews, and that they were controlled by their own network of collectors under the command of the Jerusalem Sanhedrin. However, this autonomous Jewish collection was not well seen by the Roman authorities, although accepted in theory. On several occasions, the Roman prefects did not hesitate to plunder the coffers of the Sanhedrin using any favorable pretext. In a certain way, the prefects saw this second collection as an interference and the cause of a decrease in their fiscal capacity.
* In third place were the groups or corporations with an industrial purpose: in many cases they are simply families (for example, several fishermen from the same family organize fishing crews or koinônoi that use the same boat, which could be owned by the family , or leased to a boat owner); in other cases they could be companies owned by an entrepreneur who put up the investment money and others worked for him (such as canned fish factories or tariqueas). 
* Finally, the salaried worker received his support from the corporations to which he belonged. In the worst case, there was the slave, who could only receive room and board, but did not charge a single coin for his work until he was freed.

As for the types of professions that were related to fishing, there was a whole tangled network of professionals living from this activity: 

* In obtaining the fish were the fishermen. 
* In obtaining fishing instruments: the carpenters who built the boats (shipyards), the farmers who grew flax, the flax weavers for nets and sails, and the stonemasons who polished stones with holes to make anchors and weights for the networks.
* In obtaining products derived from fish, salting fish required factories with large surfaces for drying, then winemakers who grew grapes and made wine to add to preserves, salters or salt merchants, and potters to produce vessels in which these preserves were transported. 
* In the distribution of the products we have the brokers of the markets, who bid for the purchase of the catches to later resell them to the distant merchants of another city, boatmen who transported the merchandise by sea, the stevedores, the drivers of caravans and wagons, the guards who keep shipments safe by protecting them from thieves and end traders. 

## Tenants

Fishing was not a liberalized activity, but was exercised as a right provided by tenants to whom these privileges were delivered. Surely Flavius ​​Josephus is talking about them when he says “the elite and the urban rulers” during the Hellenistic period (_AJ_ XII 169, 175, 184). And the term _kômogrammatoi_ (_AJ_ XVI 203) may refer to the village “accountants” who supervised these rents and other taxes. Ultimately, the fishermen received capital together with fishing rights, and therefore, they were indebted to local brokers responsible for the ports and the fishing leases. These tenants were also very possibly the owners of the boats and the gear, so that the fishermen only offered the labor,

Records also indicate that there was (at least in some older locations) a fishing police (_epilimnês epistatês_; or what we might anachronistically call “game keepers”), who made sure that no one fished illegally (without a fishing contract). ) or sold to unauthorized intermediaries. 

## Fishing societies and fishing families 

Fishermen could form “cooperatives” (_koinônoi_) to bid on fishing contracts or leases. One of the most interesting observations the gospels make about the families of Jonah and Zebedee is Luke's comment that they were a small-scale collective/cooperative:

> «...they signaled to their partners [_metachoi_] on the other ship to come and help them. And they came and filled both ships... [Simon] was amazed, and all his men with him, at the great number of fish they had caught; and likewise James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were members of the cooperative [_koinônoi_] with Simon» [Lk 5:7,9-10]

As it appears only in the Gospel of Luke, this description may be due to the evangelist's own experiences or interests rather than those of the fishermen. But the evidence for guild fishing in Palestine exists for a slightly later period. Evidence of an ancient Egyptian fishing lease has been found from the Roman era, an Egyptian papyrus from 46 AD identifying a fishing collective of thirteen fishermen and their scribe who took an oath to the Roman Emperor (Tiberius) regarding not catching fish sacred sites, and a fishing cooperative in Asia Minor provided an impressive stela dedicated to the tax office the cooperative paid for in AD 54-59. This cooperative (or guild) from Ephesus included both fishermen and vendors,

## Types of fishermen 

In my opinion, I believe that the appreciations of some authors are correct that among the fishermen of the Sea of ​​Galilee there were two social classes or categories: one of them would be those fishermen or businessmen who had salaried fishermen in their charge, and another that of the inferior fisherman who cannot afford to have anyone in his name. In either case, both were frequently part of family cooperatives, as we have seen. We can appreciate the difference with Zebedee. The father of the apostles must have had a comfortable financial position or else he would not have been able to do without his children for a few months.

If there were not enough family members in the cooperative, the fishermen had to employ workers to help with all the responsibilities: operating the oars and sails, mending nets, sorting fish, etc. These workers represent the bottom of the social ladder in the fishing subsystem. In Mark 119-20 we find Zebedee as a fisherman who not only has two sons working in the business, but employed workers as well. This number corresponds to the crew required for the largest ships. Both agriculture and fishing used these workers, who were perhaps day workers, that is, whose contract expired in the evening and had to return to look for work the next day (for example, Mt 20:1-16) or workers seasonal (eg, Jn 4:36).

## Types of fish 

Fish, at a general level at the time of Jesus, were classified into permitted and prohibited, that is, into clean and unclean. The Mosaic law (Lev 11:9-12) established that only vertebrate fish, with scales and fins, could be considered edible, while the others were considered prohibited. This is the underlying reason for the text in the gospel, in Mt 13:48, where there is talk of good fish (allowed by law) and bad. At the end of each catch, therefore, the fishermen had to gather on the beach, and separate the impure fish, returning them to the water. 

The Sea of ​​Galilee has been famous for its fish since ancient times. There are eighteen indigenous fish species in the lake, which are classified locally into three main groups:

* Las sardinas. Son endémicas al lago. Actualmente, en la temporada alta, decenas de toneladas de sardinas son capturadas cada noche. Se parece a la sardina de agua salada, y puede encontrarse en enormes bancos. Se utilizaban mucho para conservas. Estas sardinas constituyeron una parte importante de la dieta diaria en todo el país, especialmente para los que vivieron cerca del lago.
* El _biny_. Consiste en tres especies de la familia de la carpa. Su nombre viene de una palabra semítica que designa al «pelo», que se debe referir a las lengüetas típicas de los bordes de la boca del pez. Son pescados carnosos muy populares en banquetes y en la celebración del sábado.
* The _musht_. In Arabic musht means “comb”, and the five species it comprises are very famous because they have a long dorsal fin that looks like a comb. The largest and most common of these is the Galilean tilapia, today also called “San Pedro fish”, which can reach a length of 40 centimeters and weigh 1.5 kilograms. Its flat shape makes it ideal for frying, and its easy-to-separate meat and few bones make it highly sought after in meals. 

Sardines are often mentioned in the gospels as “small fish”, in contrast to the other two species, which were larger. I knowhe clearly mentions them in the miracle of the feeding of the four thousand. According to Mt 15:34 and Mk 8:5-7, “five loaves and a few small fish” was all the followers of Jesus had to eat. 

The miracle of the feeding of the five thousand appears in all four Gospels. Mt 14:17, Mk 6:38 and Lk 9:13 mention “five loaves and two fish.” But John's version (Jn 6:9) is slightly different in that it specifies that the bread is barley and uses another Greek word for fish: _opsaria_ (little fish) instead of _ichthyes_ (fish). We can assume that these small fish are not the young individuals of the large species, but that they were sardines and therefore small by nature. These, with bread, in fact, have been the usual diet of the local population.

There are several passages in the gospels that suggest the _musht_. When winter comes, this fish, which is a tropical fish, congregate in schools in the northern part of the lake, where they are attracted by the warm water of the springs that flow into the lake. This attraction offers anglers a chance to catch a bountiful catch. This fact could explain the miraculous catch of fish mentioned in the gospels (Lk 5:1-11).

In the spring, the _musht_ mate and lay their eggs on the bottom of the lake. After fertilization, the parent musht carry the eggs in their mouths for three weeks until the eggs mature. So they take care of them for a few days, and then they release them. To prevent its offspring from entering the mouth again, the parent fish ingests pebbles so that its old “home” is no longer as comfortable. They may also swallow coins and other objects with the pebbles, and many coins have been found in the mouths of _musht_. This could explain the passage in which Jesus asks Peter to look for a fish with a coin in its mouth to pay the taxes (Mt 17:24-27).

In the Church of the Multiplication which was built to commemorate the miracle performed by Jesus, in Tabgha, two small fish are shown in a sixth century mosaic. We see a basket with four loaves with a fish on each side. However, these fish do not appear to be from the Sea of ​​Galilee. All fish caught in the Sea of ​​Galilee have a single dorsal fin, while those in the mosaic have two dorsal fins. The artist who designed the Tabgha mosaic probably came from abroad to do his work and used a pattern without making sure of its correctness by taking a look at the fish in the lake. 

## A popular fishing suburb

There is a place in the lake that had at the time, as today, a special relationship for fishing. This is Tabgha, located two kilometers southwest of Capernaum. The name is a corruption of the Greek _Heptapegon_, or “Seven Springs”. And the name is very correct, because in the vicinity of Tabgha there is a group of springs that vary in volume, temperature and salinity. Flavius ​​Josephus referred to the larger one as the Capernaum Spring, thus pointing to a clear connection between Heptapegon and Capernaum. In another article it has already been studied that this location of Heptapegon or Tabgha is actually one of the firm proposals that archaeologists made during the first campaigns to the holy land for the location of Bethsaida, the city of origin of the apostles Andrew, Peter and Philip.

In winter, when the warm water drives the neighborhood's heat-loving mush banks, Capernaum's fishermen would remain in this area until early spring, making Heptapegon a major commercial suburb of Capernaum. A small port that must have served fishermen was discovered in 1975. 

## Fishing techniques 

Various fishing methods have been used for centuries on the Sea of ​​Galilee: 

- a) Some fishermen caught with bare hands, 
- b) some used spears , arrows or harpoons 
- c) hooked—a rod with a hook and flax line. Peter and Andrew were said to be fishing with a hook and line when they caught the fish with the coin in its mouth (Mt 17:27). 
- d) throwing linen nets into the water;
- e) some used wicker baskets or other kinds of traps made of nets or ropes. 

While hooks are mentioned in the Gospels (Mt 17:27), the most common mode of fishing in Galilee seems to have been with nets. After the generic word “nets” (Mk 1:18-19) in the New Testament three different types are mentioned:

* the shuttle net (_amphiblêstron_), used both from a ship and from the shore (Mt 4:18); it is circular, about 7 meters in diameter, with control weights attached to the edge. A man usually throws the net in a circle from the shore, but it was also done from boats. It required great skill as it had to open wide when it fell into the water to catch the fish below. Peter and Andrew were busy with this type of fishing when Jesus called them out. The weights gather as the nets sink and surround the fish. Sometimes fishermen in a boat had to jump into the water to retrieve the net and this is why they so often fished naked. The disciples were probably fishing with shuttle nets when they discovered Jesus on the shore (Jn 21:7).
* and the much larger dragnet (_sagênê_), used from a boat (Mt 13:47). It is the oldest type of network. The net was made as a long wall 100 meters long and 4 meters high. The bottom of the net had weights with plumb lines, and the top end had cork floats. The net was bending. A team of up to 16 men kept the rope tightly attached to the sweeper. The boat sailed with other equipment until the net was fully stretched and then it turned around and returned to shore. Here the second team set foot on the ground and maintained the ties. Both teams then dragged the net and its contents (in the best of cases many fish), towards the coast. This method made it possible to capture the fish that were hiding at the bottom of the lake.
* The third method is the trap net, which was actually made up of three nets, two large mesh walls one and a half meters high with a finer net in between. The boat went out into deep water where there are no stones so that the nets would not break. It was usually done at night. One end of the net was submerged in the sea, the boat made a circle that formed a type of barrel in the water. The net caught all kinds of fish, as they were unable to escape through the three layers of net. When the fish were brought ashore, they had to be removed from the nets and this took time and skill. The nets were spread out on the stones to dry and be repaired. Only in emergency situations were the ships repaired. Thus we find James and John mending their net on a ship (Mt 4:21).

Greek authors, such as Oppiano and Aeliano, mention up to ten different types of networks, but are unable to distinguish between them. The nets required a lot of attention: the fishermen and their employees not only made the nets, but after each outing the nets had to be repaired, washed, dried and folded (Mk 1:19). 


## Useful for fishermen 

For their work, fishermen needed the resources of farmers and artisans, including (but not limited to): flax for nets and sails, cut stone for anchors, wood for boat building and repair, and baskets for fish.

As for the baskets, they are called in Greek _spuris_ (Mk 8:8) to a basket with handles, and kophinios (Mk 6:42) to a wide basket that was used since time immemorial carried by women on their heads.

As for boats, the Gospels and Josephus speak of boats on the Sea of ​​Galilee for fishing and shipping. In 1986 an ancient fishing boat was discovered in the mud on the northwestern shore of the Sea of ​​Galilee, just north of Magdala. It was a small boat, about 8.8 meters long, 2.5 meters wide and 1.25 meters high. These boats, called _ploiarion_, allowed four to six fishermen to fish and maneuver the ship comfortably. The large ships, or _ploion_, intended for transport, were 18 meters long by 5 meters wide, and could accommodate a cargo of over one tonne, which included the five crew members and cargo, or a crew of about ten passengers (Mk 6:45). In some cases they had a small shed in the stern.

The wood used to make the boats was of poor quality, coming from the Golan forests. For the keel they used to reserve the best wood, the cedar of Lebanon, but for the planks they used what they had on hand: pine, jujube and willow. This made the boats extremely fragile to the winds and the wear and tear of work, so they had to be repaired continuously with patches from other boats. 

The need for these resources is often ignored by scholars when imagining Jesus' activity in Capernaum. As a carpenter, he could perfectly well work in a shipyard responsible for the manufacture and repair of boats. The manufacture of ships, in addition, attracted other subsidiary industries (that of pitch to caulk the ships, that of painting, etc.).

## The fish canning industry The fish 

trade also brought with it the fish processing industry. During the Hellenistic era, seasoned fish had become a staple food throughout the Mediterranean, in town and country alike. The result was the development of a distinction in trade between those who caught fish, those who processed fish, and those who sold fish. But as a stela from Ephesus shows, fishermen and vendors may have worked cooperatively. The distribution of catches was also controlled by government-approved wholesalers. While fish processors are not explicitly mentioned in the gospels, seasoning fish is mentioned (Jn 6:9-11; also Tob 2:2).

Fish was processed for preservation and transportation as cured, pickled, dried, or salted; and could be mixed with brine and with wine. The Bible and the Mishnah also speak of various ways of eating fish: roasted or grilled (Lk 24:42; Jn 21:9; Tob 6:5), minced (AZ 2:6), cooked with leeks (M.Sh 2:1), with an egg (Beit. 2:1), or in milk (Hul. 8:1). Fish oil could also be used as fuel for lamps (Shab. 2:2) and as medicine. The writer Athenaeus (c. AD 200) speaks eloquently of the varieties and uses of processed fish (_Deinosofistas_ 3.116a-121d). He also mentions “vendors of processed fish.” In the work Geoponica (a Byzantine compilation of recent sources) we find the recipe for _garum_, a fish-based sauce that was all the rage in Roman times.

The _garum_, also called _liquamen_, is made in this way: the entrails of the fish are placed in a vat and salted. Whole minnows are also used, especially smelt, or tiny mullet, or minnows, or anchovies, or whatever small fish is available. The entire mixture is salted and placed in the sun. After it has been aged in the heat, the _garum_ is extracted in the following way: a thickly woven basket is placed in the vat filled with the aforementioned fish. The _garum_ is placed in the basket, and the so-called _liquamen_ is strained through the basket and collected. The remaining sediment is _allex_. There were different variants of _garum_. Three famous ones were the Hispanic _garum_, the Bithynian and the Judeo. Pliny the Elder identifies the Jew with a particular variety of processed fish: _castimoniarum_ (_Historia Natural_ 31,

During the Roman period, fishmongers exported many varieties of processed fish, differentiated by the type of fish used, the parts of the fish, the process, and the recipe. The four basic types were _garum_, _liquamen_, _muria_ and _allex_. The terms _salsamentum_ and _salugo_ referred to the saline solution used for salting. It has been shown by literary references and amphorae that there were many categories of these products, the best being the _garum sociorum_ produced in Hispania (Pliny, _Historia Natural_ 31.94).

The articles necessary for the processing of fish had to be supplied by merchants, farmers and artisans, which dragged down an entire subsidiary industry. We have: salt, wine, amphorae and possibly olive oil. The brine supplies would no doubt have come from the Dead Sea in the south or Palmyra in the northeast.

Canned fish and fish sauces were distributed by merchants throughout Galilee and the rest of Palestine, as well as throughout the Mediterranean basin. This involved shippers and packers. The most used distribution route was the _Via Maris_, which flowed into Capernaum to the north, bordered the western coast and then branched off to the west, surely once at the height of Genesaret and Magdala, through the valley of Asochis and Cana, in the direction of Ptolemaida (Akkó), or at the height of Tiberias, in the direction of Sepphoris and then to Caesarea Maritima. In any case, looking for a seaport in the Mediterranean (hence the “via del mar”).

Jewish amphorae with traces of fish sauce have been found in shipwrecks. In a description of a ship built for Heiron of Syracuse, Athenaeus states: “On board were loaded ninety measures of grain, ten thousand jars (keramia) of seasoned fish (tarichôn), six hundred tons of wool, and other merchandise totaling six hundred tons.” » (_Deinosophists_ 5,209). 

## Relationship of Jesus with fishing 

Jesus had personal knowledge of the life of the Galilean fishermen, as can be seen in Mt 7: 9-10: «Which of you, if his son asks for bread, will give him a stone? Or if he asks for a fish, will he give him a snake? »

This reference to the stone and the snake seems to be taken from the fishermen's daily experience, as it symbolizes the frustration of a disappointing catch. It often happens that instead of fish, mostly stones appear in the net, and it may even happen that, along with the fish, the net catches some water snakes, which are very common in the lake. We can imagine Jesus and his followers, carrying their packages of bread and pickled sardines, appreciating these references to a reality they knew so well. 

## Christianity and the symbology of the fish

Until the Second Vatican Council, Catholics could be identified by eating fish on Fridays. And it has been a very frequent religious practice of Catholicism to replace meat with fish during certain liturgical moments in the diet. Is there perhaps in this conduct a certain reverence for the Jewish way of life of Jesus, who as a Jew despised pork and prioritized fish in his diet, even more so as he was a Galilean?

The fish is the oldest Christian symbol. The Greek word for fish, _ichthus_, is an acrostic for the Greek words that translate “Jesus Christ Son of the Savior God.” The symbol of the fish is constant in Christian art and literature. The symbol is seen on mosaics in Christian churches, on frescoes, on a painted wall in the catacombs of Rome, on crystals, goblets, sarcophagi, and monuments throughout the Roman world.

The fish symbol was used by persecuted Christians as a code meaning “Christ” to avoid arrest and execution by the Roman authorities. When a drawing of a fish appeared outside a Roman home it meant that the Lord's Supper would be observed that night. Only some time later, the sign of the cross, scandalous at first, ended up substituting the fish as a universal symbol to signify the new Christian religion.

# Monetary system and cost of living in times of Jesus 

## The monetary system 

The value of the currency was not equal to its content in precious metal . It can be estimated that the denarius, the reference currency, was 1.6 to 2.85 times the value of the silver it contained.

The authority to mint gold or silver coins was held only by the Roman emperor (in the time of Jesus first Octavian Augustus and then Tiberius), and the minting of high-value coins was centralized in Rome. These coins were the interesting ones for the tax collection machinery. As for bronze and copper coins, there was more permissiveness and Rome allowed local minting to be carried out by client-kings or by their provincial governors. In the year 18 BC, Augustus carried out a monetary reform that left the value and currency conversions as indicated in this document. 

The official coins of the Roman Empire and its provinces were these: 

* Aureo (Latin _Aureus_): it was the highest coin, made of gold. It was equivalent to 25 denarii or 400 aces.
* Gold Quinary (Latin _Denarius Aureum_ or _Quinarius Aureus_): it was half aureus, gold, that is, 12 and a half denarii. 
* Denarius (Latin _Denarius Argenteus_): it was the official coin of the Roman Empire, made of silver, a replica of the ancient Greek drachma. At the time of Jesus it was worth 16 aces. It started out worth 10 aces (hence the word denarius) but by the time of Jesus it had depreciated to 16 aces. It had a bust of the emperor on one side and on the other it used to have Roman religious motifs, such as the lituum or crook of the augurs and ceremonial vessels. It weighed about 3.36 g, an eighth of an ounce (27 g). 
* Silver Quinary (Latin _Quinarius Argenteus_): or half denarius, also made in silver, it was equivalent to 8 aces.
* Sestertius (Latin _Sestertius_): used to be a bronze coin, although it could be made of silver, it was a quarter of a denarius or 4 aces. 
* Dupondio (latin _Dupondius_): bronze, the eighth part of the denarius or 2 aces (hence its name). 
* As (Latin _Aes_): Augustus minted a double series of bronze and brass or orichalcum, difficult to distinguish from the dupondians. 
* Semis (Latin _Semis_): half of the ace, minted in a double series of bronze and brass or orichalcum. 
* Quadrant (latin _Quadrans_): the fourth part of the ace, was made of bronze.

However, in the Judea area and its surroundings, and in the rest of the known world, other currencies were used that were used locally in a preponderant way over the official currencies. They were never gold, as this metal was reserved for imperial coins, and they used to be silver and bronze. Along with the official coins of the Roman Empire, provincial coins minted in Antioch and Tire (of the Greek type) and then local Jewish coins (probably minted in Caesarea) were also in circulation in Judea. To this we must add the special case of the currency used for the payment of taxes in the temple of Jerusalem,

In short, the following coins were used in the Hebrew area: 

* _Sela_ (Hebrew word, plural _sela'im_): silver. It was a coin equivalent to two shekels of Tyre, which was called the tetradrachm there, but it was obviously not the same as the Greek tetradrachm. 
* Shekel of Tire: it was a _shekel_ (see below) minted in Tire with which every Jew was obliged to pay the taxes to the temple, which was half a shekel per year per person. This was the reason for the existence of money changers in the precincts of the temple, which Jesus did not like so much, that as usurers they took a hefty commission for exchanging money. It was equivalent to four silver denarii. The famous thirty coins paid to Judas for his betrayal are believed to have been shekels. See later.
* _Zuz_ (Hebrew word, plural _zuzzim_): silver. It was a currency equivalent to the denarius and the drachma that was in use before the Jewish territory fell under Roman rule and that was minted again by the Jews themselves during the Bar Kochba revolt, but that during the life of Jesus it was overruled in favor of the Roman denarius. However, due to its popularity among Jews, it is quite possible that in certain regions it continued to be used in a subversive and shadowy way. Although this term is used interchangeably with the denarius, in reality the zuz was originally equivalent to the Greek drachma which was a quarter of the Greek tetradrachma, about 17 grams in weight, while the denarius was a quarter of the Tyrian shekel (or Jewish shekel). for the payment of the tax) or the tetradrachm of the provinces of the Roman Empire, about 14 grams of weight. Therefore, he had something more value than the usual drachma in the provinces, and hence he was preferred by the Jews.
* _Kalbon_ (Hebrew word, plural _kalbonot_): silver. It is not very clear if it was equivalent to a sixth or a twelfth of a denarius or zuz. If it was a sixth then it was equivalent to an ancient Hebrew coin called a _gerah_ or _ma'ah_ (plural _ma'ot_), and if it was a sixth then it was equivalent to an ancient coin called a _half-ma'ah_. Two kalbon was the typical amount the priests kept when collecting the temple tax supposedly to pay the money changers. 
* _Perutah_ (Hebrew word, plural _perutot_): bronze, there were 2 _lepta_. It was equivalent to the Roman quadrans.
* _Lepton_ (Hebrew word, plural: _lepta_): bronze, the smallest coin used in Judea at the time of Jesus. It was also called _mite_. The famous widow of the gospels dropped several of these coins into the temple offering chest.

It should be noted that in the time of Jesus there were always two current currencies. One was the “official” currency used in the Jerusalem temple (such as _selaim_, shekels, or half-shekels), and then there was the same currency, but in use outside of Jerusalem, in Galilee or other regions. Those coins used to be called by the same name, but they contained much less silver, like half or a fifth less, and therefore had less value. When a tax was requested, it was usually indicated in amounts of the sela of Judea, or the sela of Galilee. A Galilean had to pay an extra percentage if he paid with the local currency of his region, or else he was forced to exchange currency for the official currency used in the temple through money changers who charged him a commission for these transactions. 

In the Phoenician and Carthaginian area:

* Trishekel: silver, or three shekel. 
* Dishekel: silver, or two shekel. 
* Shekel or shekel: silver. It was equivalent to 4 denarii or drachmas, or the tetradrachma. 
* Half a shekel: it was worth half a shekel. 
* Quarter shekel: it was worth a quarter of the shekel. 
* Agora: it was worth from 1/20 to 1/25 of a shekel. 

In the Greek zone (Alexandria and Greece): 

* Tetradrachmas of fleece: introduced by the emperor Tiberius in Alexandria, it was equivalent to four drachmas. There was an earlier silver tetradrachm, but it fell into disuse because of the fleece coin. The fleece is an alloy of silver and copper at 50% more or less, called from the French billon, which means ingot.
* Drachma: silver, equivalent to the denarius, and represented 6 obols, 24 dicalques or 48 calques of this time. It was the official currency of the Hellenistic era, which in pre-Roman times served the same purpose as the Roman denarius, but ceased to be minted during the Roman Empire in favor of the denarius. 
* Pence: bronze, one-sixth of a drachma, introduced by Augustus in Alexandria. It was an intermediate coin between the sestertius and the Roman dupondium. 
* Dicalco: bronze, a quarter of the obolus, introduced by Augustus in Alexandria. It was a coin between the Roman semis and ace. 
* Calco: of bronze, the eighth part of the obolus, introduced by Augustus in Alexandria. It was a coin. It was a coin between the Roman semis and quadrans. 

In Mesopotamia:

* Talent: although initially it was a Babylonian monetary measure, the one with the highest value, later its designation was extended throughout the known world, to designate large sums of money. In Roman times a talent was 100 pounds of silver, or 1,200 ounces of silver (1 pound = 12 ounces), or 9,600 denarii (1 ounce, 27 g = 8 denarii), or 153,600 aces (about 25 million of the old pesetas). Spaniards, compared to the current cost of living). 
* Mina: another monetary measure, not currency, which was 1/60 talent, or 160 deniers or 2,560 aces. 

In Pergamon:

* Cistóforo: Silver coin symbol of the ancient kingdoms of Pergamon (kingdoms that later would be the Roman province of Asia) that was minted from the second century BC and continued to be issued during the first century AD. C., with the first emperors of the Empire. The name cistophorus comes from the person who carried the “cista mystica” used in the cult of Dionysus, which contained a snake inside. Minted mainly in Ephesus and Pergamon and with the value of three denarii, it gradually adopted the motifs and styles of Rome over time. 

In India: 

* Satamana: silver, 3 karshapana
* Karshapana: Characteristic rectangular-shaped silver coin from ancient India. Their minting on one side only, the absence of writing and, above all, the different symbols that distinguish the series (and perhaps the reigns, although they have not been clearly deciphered), differentiate these primitive coins from those minted in the Greek world. These early issues (5th-2nd centuries BC) are based on silver, their unit of account being the 'ratti', the mass of the scarlet colored gunja seed weighing 0.11 g. The main coins are called: satamana, weighing 11 g (100 rattis) and karshapana weighing 3.5 g (32 rattis). It was roughly equivalent to a denarius.

## Comparison with today's coins (in the year 2009) 

Bearing in mind the prices and cost of living at the time of Jesus, it is safe to say that there is a relative correspondence between the value of the Roman ace and the euro of the countries of the current European Community. This can serve to give an idea of ​​what the products would cost at that time. But a warning must be made. Of course, at that time the cost of living was lower because there was hardly any middle class and people lived with far fewer material comforts than those enjoyed in Europe today. However, the euro-as correspondence can be used to calculate the relative cost of basic food products.

## Jewish Coins of Herod the Great (37 – 4 BC) 

Herod the Great's coinage continued the Jewish tradition of not depicting idols. However, a Herod _prutah_ was the first coin since the Persian period to depict a living being, an eagle, which may have been an allusion to the golden eagle that Herod had placed over the entrance to the temple and which caused such great offense to the Jews.

Other objects depicted on Herod's coins included a winged caduceus and the pomegranate (_rimmon_), one of the seven species mentioned in the Bible with which the Land of Israel had been blessed, a feathered helmet and shield, the stern of a boat and a palm branch. The largest issue denomination made by Herod is one year old, year 3, and shows a number of unusual designs, such as a helmet with large cheek pieces, surmounted by a star. The second-largest issue denomination features a crested helmet and shield, as well as the Greek letter Chi within a diadem and a tripod with a ceremonial bowl. These designs are surrounded by the Greek inscription ΉΡΩΔΟΥ ΒΑΣΙΛΕΩΣ (of King Herod).

The Greek letter Chi representing the “crown of Kehunah” (high priest) and the diadem representing the “crown of Malchus” are taken to mean that Herod ascribed both offices to himself. 

The most common _prutah_ issued by Herod the Great is similar in design to that of Hasmonean coins, an anchor inscribed in Greek ΉΡωΔ ΒΆCΙ (King Herod), and a caduceus between two cornucopias, which was intended as a continuation of the Hasmonean coin. , as well as a continuation of the Hasmonean dynasty.

## Jewish Coins of Herod Archelaus (4 BC - 6 AD) 

The most common coins of Herod Archelaus are small _prutot_ that they represent a bunch of grapes, one of the seven species, and a crested helmet with his name (Herod) and his title (ethnarch) in Greek (ΉΡΩΔ ΕΘΝ), and the prow of a ship and a crown of flowers with his name and abbreviated title. Grapes were commonly depicted on Jewish coins, as they served as a reminder of the country's fertility. Other Archelaus coins featured a ship's prow and a laurel wreath. 

A rare double _prutah_ of Herod Archelaus depicts a top hat attached to a double cornucopia, also inscribed in Greek with his name and title.

## Jewish coins of Herod Antipas (4 .C. - 39 AD) 

The coins of Herod Antipas are quite rare, and can be divided into four categories: i) the coins dated «24 years» with the inscription ΤΙΒΕΡΙΆC (Tiberias), where the coins were minted, with a crown In the reverse; ii) coins with years 33, 34 or 37, which also have the inscription ΤΙΒΕΡΙΆC on the reverse; iii) coins dated 43 with the inscription ΓΆΙΩ ΚΆΙCΆΡΙ ΓΕΡΜΆΝΙΚΩ (Caius Caesar Germanicus) on the reverse; and iv) a single known example of a coin dated “year 4” with the inscription ΤΕΤ ΡΆ-ΉCΔ, ΉΡ W.

Herod Antipas' coins were minted in four denominations, with the inscription ΤΙΒΕΡΙΆC on the reverse within a wreath. The obverse had the inscription in Greek “Herod the Tetrarch” (ΗΡωΔΌΎ ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ) with an upright palm branch. One type of variant depicts a cane in an upright position.

## Jewish coins of Herod Philip II (4 BC - 34 AD)

The coins of Herod Philip II are mostly medium-sized bronze. He was the first Jewish ruler to put portraits of himself and the Roman emperors on his coins. An early coinage has a portrait of Emperor Augustus, inscribed in Greek 'KAICAPI CEBACTΩ' on the obverse, and 'ΦΙΛΙΠΠΌΎ ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ' on the reverse. Later coins featured Tiberius, depicted on the obverse with the inscription 'ΦΙΛΙΠΠΌΎ TIBEPIOΣ ΣEBAΣ', and 'ΤΕΤΡΆΡΧΌΎ' on the reverse. Both types had the facade of a four-column temple on the reverse, possibly the Jerusalem temple. The coins were dated according to the year of the Emperor's reign. 

<figure id= “” class= "image image_resized"><img src="
<em>Coponius of Herod Philippi</em> 

## Jewish coins of Coponius (6 – 9 AD) 

Coponius was the first Roman prefect of Judea, being appointed in 6 AD, when Herod Archelaus, son of Herod the Great, was deposed , and banished to Gaul by Augustus. The coins of Coponius feature the palm tree with two bunches of dates, which have only appeared in rare cases on the coins of Herod Antipas. The palm tree design was later used to represent Judea on coins issued by the Jews during the First and Second Revolts, as well as later Roman coins.

On the obverse, Coponio's coins show an ear of barley. The representation of palm trees and barley was done out of sensitivity to the Jewish belief that living beings, and especially human beings, are not represented on coins, which is why they do not have the portrait of Augustus, the emperor. However, the inscriptions on the coins clearly proclaim that Judea was occupied by Imperial Rome, hence the Greek letters surrounding the barley: [K]AISA-ros [ “Caesar's”] with the date, also in Greek letters, under the palm tree. 

## Jewish Coins of Marcus Ambibulus (9 – 12 AD)

Marcus Ambibulus was the prefect of Judea from AD 9 to 12. He issued a coin for each of the three years of his rule. Like those issued by Coponius, Ambíbulo's coins represent a palm tree with two bunches of dates and an ear of barley.

<em>Marcus Coponius Coin</em> 

## Valerius Gratus Jewish Coins (12 – 26 AD)

Valerius Gratus was prefect of Judea under Emperor Tiberius. Grato issued several different types of coins in as many years. Symbols depicted on the coins included palm branches, lilies, horns of plenty or cornucopias, vine leaves, and amphorae. His coin showed the title of Caesar within a crown, and TIB, the name of the emperor, or that of his mother Julia (IOYLIA), and the year of his reign above two cornucopias. 

## Coins during Pontius Pilate (26 – 36 AD)

The bronze coins or _prutah_ issued by Pontius Pilate between 26 to 36 AD are of special interest to Christians and Jews for their relationship with Jesus and their involvement in Jewish history. From the minting of his coins, it is thought that Pilate was determined to promote the Roman religion in Judea, regardless of whether it was offensive to the Jews, because unlike his predecessors, his coins represent Roman symbolism related to the imperial cult, such as the _simpulum_ and _lituus_. However, it has been argued that if Pilate was deliberately trying to offend the Jews he would have depicted the emperor's bust on the obverse of his coins. Instead, he painted three ears of barley. A third type of coin featured palm branches and an inscription.

The _lituus_ was the wand of the augur, and was used to interpret natural phenomena such as lightning, the flight of birds, etc. The _simpulum_ was a spoon used to pour libations at sacrifices and was a common symbol of Roman priests. These symbols would undoubtedly offend Jewish religious sensibilities, especially being placed on a coin that is so widely used on a daily basis.

## The Tire shekel for payment of tribute

In the second century BC, Rome had two types of coins in circulation in the Mediterranean region, one at Tyre, in Lebanon, and the second at Antioch. Tire shekels and half-shekels, 95% pure silver, were made in Tire between 127 BC and 19 BC In 19 BC Rome closed the Tyre mint and began importing a silver coin bottom from the Far East that consisted of 80% pure silver.

Religious leaders in Israel, realizing that the new coinage was not pure enough to fulfill the commandment to give the Jerusalem temple a half shekel, asked the emperor for permission to produce a ceremonial coin pure enough to fulfill religious obligations. . The priests were given a special dispensation to produce the required coins, on condition that they continue with the Tyrian shekel motif, so as not to arouse objections in the Roman Empire. But it turned out that on the obverse of the coin of Tire appeared the image of Melkhart, the god of the Phoenicians also known among the Greeks as Hercules. On the reverse, an eagle appeared on the prow of a ship with the legend: “Tyre holy city and city of refuge”, and the date of his expedition.

Coins minted in Jerusalem between 18 BC and 65 AD were virtually identical to their Tyrian predecessors with one addition, the letters KP appearing on the reverse at upper right, perhaps an acrostic meaning “By the authority of Rome.” ». 

The weight of this shekel or “shekel” was very constant and reliable: it weighed about four whole silver drachmas, that is to say about the tetradrachm, or what amounts to the same half ounce, but the half ounce that was later used as a measure of precision in pharmacopoeias and which was formerly called the “half Attic ounce” (about 13.7 g).

This currency was pegged as a peso in a very ancient time. Already in the scriptures it is spoken of ([Ex 30:13](/en/Bible/Exodus/30#v13) and Ez 45:12) and in both it is established that it is worth 20 obols, but in reality it refers to 20 _gerah_, that is, 20 grains of _hharvb_ or _carob_ (a word that comes from the Arabic _alharob_ and in Latin was _siliqua_).

This shekel was called the “sacred shekel” due to its use as exclusive currency for making payments in the temple. The book of Leviticus is full of references to it specifying the different prices of the obligatory Hebrew offerings (Lev 5:15). The fine for the owner of the ox that kills the servant of another was stipulated in 30 silver shekels. With shekels, the fine for prevarication and damage caused to sacred things was also redeemed. With 50 shekels the redemption of the personal vote was assessed in the case of men and 30 in the case of women, lowering the price for young people under 20 years of age. For the fields also had to pay a surrender. As Leviticus indicates, “every appraisal was to be weighed in sanctuary shekels” (Lev 27:3-25).

The abuses that the priests committed with this currency were frequent. Because it was not a currency of frequent use, it had to be acquired through money changers, who charged a commission for the currency exchange. It is told in the Talmud that if a person went to the temple to pay his half-shekel tribute with a whole shekel, then the priests kept the full shekel, demanded an additional amount, 2 kalbonot, and returned to the taxpayer a half-shekel. shekel. The payment of the kalbonot, it seems, was justified in that the priests would then have to change those coins to the moneychangers, who would charge them for the change. In addition, by returning a half-shekel to the payer, they facilitated payment for the following year. In the end, the average Jew could expect to pay a fifth of a shekel in currency exchange.

## The cost of living 

Some prices of basic products: 

* One modius (the typical Roman unit of measure, equal to 6.67 kg) of wheat: until the year 14 AD, 16 aces in Rome, 8 aces in the rest from Italy, 5-6 aces in Palestine, 5-8 in Africa, 4-8 in Assisi Minor, and 4 aces in Egypt; from AD 14 onwards these prices rose until they doubled by the end of the century. With a modius of wheat, between 16-20 loaves were made. 
* A loaf of bread: 2 aces (a dupondio) in Rome. In other places this price would have to be reduced as before. For example, in Palestine it would be 1 to half ace. 
* A sextary of wine (approx. half a liter): 1 to 5 aces 
* A sextary of good wine: up to 30 aces. 
* A bathroom in a public toilet: a quarter of ace.
* A tunic: 15 sertercios. 
* A donkey: 500 sesterces. 
* A slave: 500 denarii. 
* A slave: 2,000 to 6,000 denarii. 

## 

Salary Typical salaries: 

* Secretary: 15 pence/month. 
* Teacher: 12 pence/month. 
* Messenger: 9 pence/month. 
* Fortune teller: 10 pence/month. 
* Low legionnaire: 10 aces per day (225 denarii/year). One denarius every day and a half, or two denarii every three days (equivalent to a current salary of 300 euros per month). 
* Praetorian Guard: 375 denarii/year. 
* Centurion: 3,750 - 15,000 denarii/year.
* A peasant, according to what we are told in Mt 20:1-16, used to receive in the time of Jesus a denarius a day for working in the field. But of course, not every day a worker was lucky enough to be hired. It is already known that in the field there are times of a lot of work and times of little or none, as can be seen in the parable. Therefore, a peasant's monthly salary could not amount to more than a few denarii after sowing, and would only rise to twenty denarii at harvest time. 
* A fisherman on the Sea of ​​Galilee, like many artisans, could think of earning a denarius every two days, or 8 aces a day (equivalent to a current salary of 240 euros per month).

# Taxes in the time of Jesus 

## Imperial taxes

At the time of Jesus there were no nations as we understand them today, but rather empires and vassal states. The empire that governed the Jewish destinies was the Roman one, and by the time of Jesus, the more or less extensive kingdom that Herod ruled until the year 4 BC was divided at his death into a set of tetrarchies (divisions of lesser category than the kingdom). Herod Antipas took over Galilee and Perea; his brother Archelaus, and later a Roman prefect, took charge of Samaria, Judea and Idumea, in this case forming an ethnarchy; Herodes Filipo de Batanea, Panias, Gaulanítida and Traconítida; Salome, a sister of Herod, from the cities of Jamnia, Azotus, and Phaselis. Furthermore, there existed in the midst of these territories an area called the Decapolis, a league of independently governed cities.

The final ruling power was in the hands of the emperor and the Roman aristocratic families. They were the ones who exercised the right to collect taxes in their annexed territories, and in case of rebellion, they relentlessly sent their troops. 

But the collection of taxes, which was the central axis that conditioned the economic life of the time, was not carried out in a simple and direct way, but was deployed through a whole web and a whole hierarchy of positions until it was carried out on the common inhabitant. 

This hierarchy can be summarized as follows: 

### 1. The emperor and the aristocracy

The emperors were the greatest multimillionaires of the time thanks to disproportionate income that they obtained above all from direct annual tributes that their client-kings exerted on land ownership and on individuals (Mk 13:12-17, BJ II:403 and 405). Second, they enriched themselves through indirect taxes of various kinds, including customs fees on ports and roads (Pliny, Natural History 12:32,63-65). Lastly, they were beneficiaries of the will of their client-kings, and this latter source was by no means negligible. Josephus reports that Herod the Great, for example, bequeathed Augustus 1000 talents (about 6 million denarii), and Augustus's wife Julia 500 talents (AJ XVII:146,190). Suetonius says that in the last twenty years of his reign,

The silver talent, which was actually a measure of weight (35 kg), roughly corresponded to 6,000 drachmas in ancient times, and to the same number of denarii. But this measure of money was not very precise and fluctuated at the time of Jesus. 

### 2. The client-kings and the prefects 

Below the emperor are the client-kings, like Herod Sr., and after him his sons Archelaus, Herod Antipas, and Herod Philip. Similarly, if it was not convenient for a local petty king to rule, the emperor could resort to Roman governors. During the period of Jesus' life, this is what happened to the ethnarchy of Archelaus, which passed into the hands of a Roman prefect.

As for Herod the Great, he gained a reputation for spending money. Josephus says of him: “Because he spent more than his resources allowed, he had to be hard on his subjects.” The substantial income from him through taxes earned him not a little antipathy among the people. His son Archelaus, like him, went so far in these matters and managed his ethnicity so badly, that Augustus did not hesitate to depose him, banish him and confiscate all his property, placing a Roman prefect.

Both client-kings and prefects must earn the emperor's trust. His position is not for life. They know that at any time they can be deposed and replaced by another more trusted sovereign. For this reason, they had to be ready to satisfy the emperor by giving him all kinds of flattery. For example, Antipas builds Tiberias in honor of Emperor Tiberius and her half-brother Philip reinforces Bethsaida by renaming it Julias, in honor of a daughter of Caesar, according to Josephus. 

Each administrative division had an annual income applied. Archelaus was required to pay 600 talents or 3.6 million denarii (according to Flavius ​​Josephus in AJ 17:318), Herod Antipas 200 talents or 1.2 million denarii, Philip 100 talents or 600,000 denarii, and Salome 60 talents.

However, these were the amounts at the death of Herod the Great, when his kingdom was divided by Augustus into tetrarchies. Very possibly, in the time of the adult Jesus, thirty years later, these taxes were considerably higher. We can deduce this by verifying that the 960 talents required among all the tetrarchies became 2000 talents (more than double!) with Agrippa I, in the time of Caligula, 38 AD (AJ 19:352). Therefore, by AD 30 the 960 talents had surely grown to about 1,500.

On the other hand, the petty kings and prefects also got their personal share of the collection of taxes. They had to deliver the required amount to the emperor, but in reality they charged the people higher percentages, sometimes truly abusive, so that those 1,500 talents could easily become 2,000. The profit of 500 talents would swell the private coffers of these client-kings and governors. This money represented a good fortune with which these characters could live on many occasions surrounded by luxury and waste. Herod Antipas was the epitome of a foolish king who earned the enmity of his people for his continual excesses. Not surprisingly, frequent protests arose among the Jewish people (BJ II:4; Tacitus, Annals 2:42). Josephus calls Herod Antipas a “lover of luxury” (AJ XVIII:245). Since Josephus himself was situated in the urban elite, this comment must be taken as critical, meaning that Herod Antipas was “overdoing it.” His half-brother Herod Philip, on the other hand, seems to have ruled his tetrarchy somewhat more sparingly.

As an element of comparison, it is convenient to remember that a denarius was the labor wage of a common worker. A legionnaire of the Roman army will receive two denarii a day. Those 500 talents that the tetrarchs could swell each year for their private coffers, or 3 million denarii, represented a disproportionate fortune. 

### 3. Chief Tax Collectors

These were the ones to whom the client-kings and prefects delivered the collection rights directly. Without a doubt, they took a very substantial part of the operation by raising the tax, which had already been increased with the extraordinary bonus applied by the rulers. As we will see, the tax was increasing through a good number of intermediaries, so that the final payers had to suffer a much higher tax than the one set by the emperors.

They were called _architelonai_. We have an example mentioned in the gospel with Zacchaeus of Jericho (Lk 19:1-10). Jericho was the capital of one of the toparchies of Judea (the toparchy is an administrative division just below the tetrarchy, for fiscal purposes), so Zacchaeus held a position of importance. It is curious, but Lk 19:10 proves the fact that these chief collectors enriched themselves to unsuspected limits at the expense of the commissions. Zacchaeus says: “Lord, half of my possessions I give to the poor, and if I deceived anyone, I will return four times more.” A lot of money must have hoarded this man to make such a claim. (It is interesting to think how Pilate, who ruled in Judea, must have felt that one of his _architelonai_ from Jericho suddenly decided to turn altruistic. We do not know what became of Zacchaeus, but it is unlikely that his sudden change in behavior allowed him to continue in office. The rulers needed unscrupulous people for these positions.)

The parable that follows the story of Zacchaeus in the Gospel of Luke (Lk 19:11-28) also has a great deal to do with these chief collectors. It is a veiled reference to Herod Archelaus and his attempt to obtain the crown from Augustus. The servants of the would-be king are actually the _architelonai_. As can be seen from the parable, these chief collectors had to have a very good nose for business, since they not only had to deliver the amount required by the emperor but also the plus that the local ruler demanded of them. Therefore, they had to be experts in making productive investments and making their money grow. Otherwise, there were no second chances, and the position was given to another. Such a charge, despite how frowned upon it was among the Jews,

### 4. Tax collectors and customs officials

The _architelonai_ actually sold their tax collection rights to local collectors, who raised the tax with a new plus for their personal gain before finally applying it to the citizens. In order to do this, it was required that every person liable to pay the tax (over sixteen years of age) be registered in some type of census. There were censuses of people, censuses of properties, and censuses of industrial activities. The collectors had these censuses and kept them up to date. No one could work without being registered in a census. The collectors literally chased the delinquent and went from house to house demanding the tribute. For this they would have a good number of officials in charge of collecting those who did not voluntarily present themselves for payment.

Taxes were applied, therefore, for possessions and goods (_tributum soli_), for production, and for people or poll tax (_tributum capitis_). In the case of an entrepreneur who had laborers or slaves in his charge, he withheld a part of the wages for the payment of the latter tax. In the payment of the tax for production, this could be done in kind. This payment in kind was often made for grain crops and for wine. 

When the day laborer could not pay the tax, these collectors also acted as lenders, advancing the money in the form of debt that later had to be repaid with bloody interest.

But all this is just direct taxes. There was also a good number of indirect taxes, coming from the use of bridges and roads, the transport of merchandise (even each product had its own price), the use of water from aqueducts, the use of port facilities, and a long etcetera. . For the collection of these taxes there was also a dense body of publicans (_publicani_) or customs collectors. Most likely, Matthew the apostle was one of them.

Customs rates were 2%, 2.5%, or 5%, depending on the goods; and this rate of 2% (more or less) is exemplified by one of the technical terms for “customs collectors”: _pentêkostologos_ (“the collector of the fiftieth”; Athenaeus, Los deinosofistas 2:49; 11:481). Toll fees for the roads varied considerably; they also applied to animals (at different rates for camels and donkeys) and to carts. Presumably the rulers raised a handsome sum from local traffic on roads and bridges. The construction of these infrastructures, paid for by kings and emperors, was not carried out for the satisfaction of the populace, but of the upper class. For the common people it only had a fiscal function. In a list of tolls from Coptus, Egypt (AD 90), the tolls appear, providing some idea of ​​1st century rates in a Roman province. They cover different classifications of people based on sex, position, and profession (for example, 5 drachmas for a sailor, 20 drachmas for a female sailor); and different animals and transport (for example, 1 obol for a camel, 4 drachmas for a covered wagon). Another example: the import duty to bring ripe fish to Palmyra in AD 137 was 10 denarii for each camel load.

## Religious taxes 

To all this suffocating situation of the economy of the time we must add the payment of the obligatory religious taxes for the sustenance of the priestly class and the Temple of Jerusalem. This payment was made both in currency and also in the form of a percentage of the production or tithe. 

There were several religious taxes that were required to be paid annually: 

* One from the production of the land and cattle, 
* another for the maintenance of worship, known as the “half shekel” or didrachma, 
* and finally, other minor ones, such as the earmarked for the purchase of firewood for the altar. 

Special mention are the taxes due to the birth of first-born children. 

### Tax from local products

This tax included several concepts that could be paid in money or in kind. From this tax and from the cattle is where the priests obtained their highest income. It consisted of the following:

* The firstfruits or _bikkurim_. It affected the so-called “seven species”, that is, the seven main crops in Palestine: wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives and honey. If you lived near Jerusalem, you took the product fresh, and if you lived abroad, dried. It is noteworthy that despite being a tax, the town organized festive processions with great excitement to carry the load. Garlands were placed on the baskets, a caparisoned bull led the way to be sacrificed, and the procession was received in the temple court by the Levites. Each participant then handed over his basket while intoning a passage from Deuteronomy. Perhaps this festive atmosphere is due to the fact that the people, despite knowing that it was a tax, still saw it as a religious offering in gratitude for the harvest,
* The _terumah_. Here not only the seven species of the firstfruits entered, but also the fruit of the trees. Above all it affected wheat, wine and oil. On average, one-fiftieth of a person's annual income had to be paid. This payment was surely seen more than the previous one as a payment to the priests, although both were in reality, since these first fruits could only be consumed inside the temple by the priests. Their families could not benefit.
* The tithe. It was the largest and largest. It affected everything, even the smallest thing that the farmer could produce, of which a tenth part had to be delivered annually. The gospels show in some passages the excessive scrupulosity that the priests applied to determine if the product was tithable or not. Even the less valuable products, such as mint, dill and cumin, had to be taken into account (Mt 23:23; Lk 11:42). This tax was intended for the Levites or second order ministers of the temple, but the priests had devised a ruse to seize part of the spoils. One tenth of what the Levites received went to the priests. And this part could be used by the entire priestly family.
* The second tithe. It was not intended for the priests or the Levites, but even so, it was one more tax that completely undermined the domestic economy of the time. It was another tenth of everything produced, which had to be taken to Jerusalem and consumed there in sacrificial feasts. 
* Finally, the “mass offering” or _hallah_. It affected dough made from wheat, barley, spelt, oats, and rye. The dough was delivered, not the grain. A normal citizen had to deliver the twenty-fourth part, and a baker the forty-eighth part of the total. 

If the percentages of each tax are added, it can be seen that in total the contribution represents a little more than a quarter of all agricultural production! 

### Tax from cattle

The most important thing was the delivery of the firstborn male of the cattle. In the case of animals suitable for sacrifice (bulls, rams and goats), it had to be delivered in kind. If they had no defect they were sacrificed, their blood was sprinkled on the altar and the fat was burned. The rest was kept by the priests and they could consume it in Jerusalem as they pleased. If they were defective, then the entire animal became the property of the priesthood. As for the impure animals (horse, donkey, and camel), an amount of ransom money had to be paid. For a donkey you had to pay a sheep. The amount came to be a shekel and a half for each animal. 

There was also a shearing tax for owners of flocks of sheep. It came to be about five sela from Judea, or ten from Galilee.

### The “half shekel” 
	
had to be paid in ancient Hebrew or Tyrian (Phoenician) currency. The time fixed to make the payment was the month of Adar (February-March) and it used to be collected by local collectors in the communities, who were then in charge of transferring it to Jerusalem. He was obligated to pay it to every male Israelite over the age of twenty. Due to the fact that the shekel was not a common currency, the people saw the need to use money changers who carried out the currency conversion, taxing the change with a not insignificant amount, and causing the half shekel to become almost three quarter shekel.

It is told in the Talmud that if a person went to the temple to pay his half-shekel tribute with a whole shekel, then the priests kept the full shekel, demanded an additional amount, 2 kalbonot, and returned to the taxpayer a half-shekel. shekel. The payment of the kalbonot, it seems, was justified in that the priests would then have to change those coins to the moneychangers, who would charge them for the change. In addition, by returning a half-shekel to the payer, they facilitated payment for the following year. In the end, the average Jew could expect to pay a fifth of a shekel in currency exchange. 

### Other taxes

Another fee was paid annually, specifically an annual offering of wood for the altar of burnt offerings. Any kind of firewood was admitted, except olive tree and vine stock. 

### The ransom of the firstborn 

The firstborn son, that is, the first male child that a woman had, had to be ransomed at the age of one month by paying five shekels (Num 18:15-16; Nm 3: 44ff; Neh 10:37; [Ex 13:13](/en/Bible/Exodus/13#v13); 22:28; 34:20). It was not necessary to present the child in the temple, contrary to what Lk 2:22 suggests. 

## In summary 

We can imagine the economic situation of an average peasant of that time, or a low-ranking merchant, if we assume an average income of 500 denarii per year, and we make the following list of taxes to be deducted:

Concept | Denarii 
--- | ---: 
Monarch taxes | 50 
Other taxes (roads, tolls, customs, etc.) | 25  
Firstfruits | 5 
Terumah | 10 
General Tithe | 50 
Tithe for the poor or second tithe | 15 
Annual sacrifices for any cause (livestock, first-born, etc.) | 9 
Annual rate for the Temple (taking into account money changers) | 2.5 
Overall | 166.5

In other words, only about 167 denarii, 33%, a third of the income of a person with few resources, and also subject to the risks of the weather and bad times, went into taxes. We can imagine the discontent that such bloodletting could cause in the population, especially when contemplating how those incomes that with so much effort and sweat the people were in charge of producing were wasted and squandered by their rulers. 

## Conclusion

In short, the economic situation in Palestine at that time was very precarious, mainly due to the burdensome taxes and the greedy bureaucracy that had been created around them. The workers of the time of Jesus earned just enough to live, there was no surplus and there was no possibility of saving. However, it was a situation shared throughout the Empire. The Jews were not especially taxed, and the citizen of that time, as much as he was indignant, knew that he could not do anything against an established power and supported by an iron army that would inexorably fall at the slightest sign of anti-Jewish rebellion. collector. They tried to make Jesus fall into the trap of making statements against the tax to Caesar (Mt 22:15-22; Mk 12:13-17; Lk 20:20-26), and he, with a keen eye, and knowing the null permissiveness that Rome had in these matters, he avoided the direct answer. Was it necessary to pay the tax, or was it necessary to rebel against this situation? In the case of the Jews there was a different background than in the rest of the people for the Roman tax. The Jews did not particularly resent the tax on Caesar for simple economic reasons, but rather for a criterion of religious zeal. And it was this religious zeal, and not the amount of the tax, that ultimately sparked armed rebellion against Rome on several occasions. But in general, the situation, although suffocating, was always admitted and supported in one way or another by all the inhabitants of that time. Or was it necessary to rebel against this situation?

# Pacificism in the time of Jesus

In many books that deal with the “time of Jesus” the period between the Maccabean revolts and the Jewish uprising of 66 AD is usually spoken of. But it is clear that this period is longer than the one that Jesus lived. That is why it has been especially satisfying for me to read the book by H. Guevara entitled _Political environment of the Jewish people in the time of Jesus_. The author truly sticks to the period between the end of Herod's reign (4 BC) and the end of Pilate's prefecture (36 AD) to carry out a detailed investigation that should more correctly be entitled «Violent and peaceful nationalism in times of Jesus. The conclusions of his work have been so interesting and of such repercussion to recount _Jesus of Nazareth_, that I have decided to prepare a brief summary here.

In essence, the questions that Guevara poses are stated in the introduction: 

> Was the time of the divided Judea (6 BC to 41 AD) a revolutionary time, characterized by growing violent hostility against Rome, or, on the contrary, Was that a peaceful time when Judea strove to resolve by non-violent means the inevitable tensions that arose? What was the attitude of the Jews towards Rome at the time of the divided Judea? Was it a conciliatory attitude or a revolutionary attitude?

As Guevara points out, it is indisputable that a revolutionary party organized by a certain Judas Galileo emerged in the year 6 AD. And that in AD 66 open rebellion broke out against Rome. But what happened from the formation of the party to the rebellion? Was the whole period a constant and increasing state of war, or did it first pass through a more moderate stage? 

The answer is important. Some authors have wanted to see in Jesus a revolutionary teacher close to the circles of the guerrilla party that would eventually come to be called the “zealots.”

According to Guevara, these claims are unfounded, as is the fact that the followers of Judas Galileo called themselves “zealots.” Apparently, this title, which reproduces the sound of a Greek word by which the Aramaic _qanna_ (“jealous”) was translated, was only applied to themselves by a small group of fanatics who entrenched themselves in Jerusalem during the siege of the legions. Romans. In short, that there were no zealots in the time of Jesus (rather a group of revolutionary followers of Judas Galileo, who did not give themselves that name at that time), and that the movement started by Judas Galileo, after an initial outbreak of popular enthusiasm which ended in tragedy in 6 AD, lived secretly and moderately throughout the life of Jesus. 

Moreover, Guevara goes so far as to affirm in his conclusions:

> The time of Jesus' public life was a peaceful time. This does not mean that there were no tensions between Jews and Romans in those years, but rather that the Jews resorted to legal and peaceful means to demand respect for their law; their attitude towards the government of Rome was a conciliatory attitude, they sought a way to coexist with foreign power, in full fidelity to Jewish law.

That is to say, we have gone from considering the time in which Jesus lived from revolutionary to peaceful, and we have gone from seeing a supposed guerrilla group that constantly spread panic among the Romans, and which some authors have wanted to see as part of the activity of Jesus, to see a group of organized and moderate Jews who carry out peaceful acts to seek a solution to their conflicts with the Roman government. Undoubtedly a significant change in the way of seeing the time of Jesus. But how does Guevara arrive at these conclusions? Why do some authors see in the time of Jesus such a different period?

The explanation is easily offered by the author. Apparently, many researchers have not resorted to a detailed analysis of the literary sources that we have about the time of Jesus, but have limited themselves to extrapolating the events narrated more than thirty years after the death of Jesus, to the period of his life public. All these scholars have followed the path set out many years ago by Emil Schürer, father of Jewish history in the time of Jesus, and author of the work _History of the Jewish people in the time of Jesus_. 

In this work Schürer states (volume I, page 462):

> Since the political situation of Judea during the period from AD 6 to 41 is essentially the same as that of Palestine as a whole during the years AD 44-66, we are going to refer simultaneously to both periods, combining all the data that we dispose

That is to say, that two very different eras merge into one, as Guevara's good analysis reveals, being the first writer to warn that an organized group of Jews must have existed at the time of Jesus who acted by peaceful means, in opposed to the group of violent revolutionaries who joined Judas Galileo. Unfortunately, this group of pacifists did not thrive, finally being drowned out by the revolutionary outbreak of 66 AD. However, there are pages of history in which their imprint has been recorded, for those who are willing to reread and re-study all the issues twice.

Guevara refers to the historical sources that we have, and which are, in order of importance: Flavius ​​Josephus, Philo of Alexandria, Cornelius Tacitus, apocalyptic literature, Qumran literature, Targum and Rabbinic literature, and the New Testament. 

Here I am only going to offer a brief summary of some references that I think will be adequate to understand why Guevara reaches his conclusions. We are going to limit ourselves only to references that have to do with the time of Jesus' adult life (5 - 30 AD), and that show tensions or revolts that occurred in that period. 

## Flavius ​​Josephus

He was born (surely in Jerusalem) around 37/38 AD, that is, only seven years after the death of Jesus. He belonged to one of the most influential priestly families. Apparently he was a Jew who tried everything: he became a Sadducee, a Pharisee and an Essene for a time, and then he went to the desert in the style of John the Baptist in pursuit of a teacher named Bannus. He also traveled to Rome. Upon his return, his country was found up in arms and he had to become part of it as commander of Galilee. But he was not convinced that the military uprising against Rome was a good idea, and as soon as he was captured by the Romans, he befriended them, providing them with all sorts of help in trying to put down the rebellion. From captivity he went on to win the freedom and favor of the new emperor Vespasian. It was then that he wrote _Jewish Wars_ (_BJ_), very critical work with the so-called «zealots». Twenty years later, and when the events of the war were already in the past, he published _Antigüedades jews_ (_AJ_), his _Autobiografía_ and _Contra Apión_, an _epilogue to Antigüedades jewicos_. His work is of incalculable value to know the time of Jesus because he is the author who gathers a greater amount of historical data on the period.

Here are some excerpts from Flavius ​​Josephus (with his parallels between _BJ_ and _AJ_). 

## The rebellion of Judas Galileo 

It was the best known rebellion of the time. According to Flavius ​​Josephus, this Judas was the initiator of the “zealot” movement, but apparently the movement suffered a severe setback in its beginnings. Only much later (AD 66) was the movement associated with open warfare against Rome. Until then, the type of activities they carried out is doubtful. The Jewish historian did not hold them in very good regard, charging him with much of the blame for the sad end of Jerusalem and of the Jews of his time.

The rebellion happened just at the time that Coponius was sent as the first Roman prefect to replace Archelaus (AD 6-7), at which time Quirinus was also sent to Syria as a consulate. 

Of course, the rebellion occurred at a very inopportune moment, because surely Coponio and Quirino were eager to demonstrate to their superiors the correctness of the trust placed in them, and they had to suppress the revolt quite rigorously.

> With the territory of Archelaus reduced to a province, the Roman knight Coponius was sent as governor, receiving full powers from Caesar, including capital punishment. Under his rule, a Galilean named Judas incited the country's inhabitants to rebellion, accusing them of being cowards if they paid the tax to the Romans and if they recognized mortal masters beside God. [_BJ_ II, 17] 

> Having annexed the territory of Archelaus to Syria, Caesar sent Quirinus, a man of the consular order, to carry out a census of properties in Syria and to liquidate Archelaus' assets. [_AJ_ XVII, 355]

> ^1^ Quirinus, a Roman senator, a man who had risen through all positions until reaching the consulate, arrived in Syria, sent by Caesar as juridicus of the nation and property censor. ^2^ Coponius, a Roman knight, was sent with him, as governor of the Jews, with full powers. Quirinus then went to Judea, which had been annexed to Syria, to value the properties and to liquidate the assets of Archelaus. ^3^ At first, the Jews were irritated to hear of declaration of assets; but then they condescended, thanks to the arguments made by the high priest Joazar, son of Boeto, and, convinced by his reasons, they declared their assets without hesitation. ^4^ But Judas, a Gaulanite from the city of Gamala, supported by the Pharisee Zadok, launched into rebellion, saying that the census implied slavery, and inciting the people to rebellion. ^5^ If they were successful, they said, they would have secured the happiness they possessed. If they failed in their attempt, they would obtain fame and honor for the nobility of their purposes. He said that God would collaborate in their undertaking if they, enthusiastic about the greatness of the cause, remained firm in their purpose without backing down even in the face of death. ^6^ People listened very willingly to what they said; thus the risky enterprise made rapid progress. There was no evil that these men did not cause and that did not influence the nation more than can be said. ^7^ Wars of uncontrollable violence, disappearance of friends who could have lightened sentences, attacks by bandits, murders of notables. All this under the pretext of the common good; in fact, for personal interest. ^8^ From here originated seditions and political assassinations, either at the hands of the enemies, or at the hands of the compatriots themselves, due to the blind hatred that pitted one against another. Famine that led to the worst abjection, seizure and destruction of cities, until the very temple of God became fodder for enemy flames. That was the sedition. ^9^ Thus, innovation in national institutions is an immense danger to the health of the nation. In this case, Judas and Zadok introduced a “fourth philosophy”, foreign to us; they gained numerous addicts; they filled the country with immediate disorders and sowed the roots of the evils that made themselves felt later. Everything happened because of the new philosophy. ^10^ Which I want to say something about,

Curiously, Flavius ​​Josephus does not call the sect founded by Judas Galileo “zealots”, but does not give it any name, speaking only of a “fourth sect”. 
> Judas Galileo was the master of his own sect, which had nothing like the others. [_BJ_ II, 118]

> ^23^ Judas Galileo was the founder of the “fourth sect”; this sect agrees in everything with the Pharisaic doctrine, with the exception that they have an irrepressible passion for freedom; Convinced that the only Lord and master is God, they have little to submit to the most terrible deaths and lose friends and relatives in order not to have to give any mortal the title of “Lord”. ^24^ I neglect to relate the unshakeable firmness they showed in such circumstances; Many witnessed this. I am not afraid that what is said about them seems incredible; Rather, I am afraid that my words fall short when it comes to how they accepted pain. ^25^ Such was the madness that began to affect the nation from the government of Gesio Floro, whose arbitrary measures decided the Jews to rebel against Rome. [_AJ_ XVIII, 23-25]

## Desecration of the temple courts at the hands of some Samaritans 

We cannot consider this event as a rebellion. Apparently, during the rule of Coponius (6 - 9 AD), some Samaritans scattered human bones from tombs in the temple of Jerusalem. The reason why the Samaritans did this is unknown, but it is possible that it was caused by some previous action by the Jews, which must have upset the Samaritans. In fact, Josephus says that the Jews did not retaliate for this act, but merely took measures to prevent it from happening again, surely reinforcing the security of the temple. The passage is found at AJ XVIII 29-30. 

## Pilate brings images into Jerusalem

From Coponius to Pilate nothing worth mentioning happened. Only Josephus mentions three more contemporary prefects of Jesus: Marcus Ambibulus (9 - 12 AD), Rufus (12 - 15 AD) and Valerius Gratus (15 - 26 AD). The latter frequently changed the high priest until leaving José Caiaphas in office. But no riots or disorders of any kind took place, or at least not of such a magnitude as Josephus deigns to remember.

Pilate, however, was another matter. Josephus spends a lot of time describing two very significant events. The first was the introduction of some images (probably badges without any image), an event that surely occurred during the winter of 26 AD, the year in which he took office. He probably arrived in Judea that summer, as sea voyages were common at that time and he would have traveled from Rome. The second the suffocation of a demonstration against the use of temple money.

> ^169^ Pilate, sent by Tiberius as governor to Judea, brought busts of Caesar, called insignia, into Jerusalem at night. ^170^ When the day came, this caused a huge uproar among the Jews; those present there were stunned to see how the laws that prohibit putting images in the city were violated; His indignation was immediately joined by the country people. ^ 171 ^ The Jews rushed to Caesarea, where Pilate was, begging him to remove the images from Jerusalem and to respect his laws. As Pilate refused, they fell prostrate around Pilate's house and remained motionless for five days and five nights. ^ 172 ^ The next day, Pilate went up to the court, placed in the great stadium, and summoned the people under the pretext of responding to his requests, and gave the signal to the armed soldiers to surround the Jews. ^173^ The Jews were speechless when they found themselves surrounded by a triple file of soldiers. Pilate told them that he would tear them to pieces if they did not accept the images of Caesar, and ordered the soldiers to draw their swords. ^174^ But the Jews immediately, at an agreed signal, all fell to the ground and, stretching out their necks, shouted that they were ready to die rather than break the law. Pilate, extraordinarily amazed at his deep religiosity, immediately ordered the images to be removed from Jerusalem. [_BJ_ II 169-174] ^174^ But the Jews immediately, at an agreed signal, all fell to the ground and, stretching out their necks, shouted that they were ready to die rather than break the law. Pilate, extraordinarily amazed at his deep religiosity, immediately ordered the images to be removed from Jerusalem. [_BJ_ II 169-174] ^174^ But the Jews immediately, at an agreed signal, all fell to the ground and, stretching out their necks, shouted that they were ready to die rather than break the law. Pilate, extraordinarily amazed at his deep religiosity, immediately ordered the images to be removed from Jerusalem. [_BJ_ II 169-174]

> ^55^ Pilate, commander of Judea, moved his army from Caesarea to Jerusalem to winter there; he, in order to abolish the Jewish laws, conceived the plan to introduce in the city busts of the emperor attached to the banners, even though the law prohibits the making of images. ^56^ That was why the first commanders had entered the city without such decorations. Pilate was the first, who without anyone knowing, at night, brought those busts into Jerusalem and installed them there. ^57^ When the Jews learned of this, they flocked to Caesarea and begged Pilate for many days to remove the images. Pilate did not agree, because he considered it an insult to Caesar. The Jews did not stop insisting on his requests. On the sixth day, Pilate, having secretly placed the armed soldiers with him, went up to court; he had prepared everything so that he could hide the army stationed there. ^ 58 ^ Again, the Jews persisted in pleading with him. At a prearranged signal, he surrounds the Jews with his armed soldiers and threatens them with immediate death if they persist in the melee and do not return to their homes. ^59^ The Jews prostrated themselves with their faces to the ground and, baring their necks, said that they gladly accepted death rather than transgress the wisdom of their laws. Pilate, amazed at his steadfastness in observing the law, immediately moved the images from Jerusalem to Caesarea. [_AJ_ XVIII 55-59] He surrounds the Jews with his armed soldiers and threatens to kill them immediately if they persist in the riot and do not return to their homes. ^59^ The Jews prostrated themselves with their faces to the ground and, baring their necks, said that they gladly accepted death rather than transgress the wisdom of their laws. Pilate, amazed at his steadfastness in observing the law, immediately moved the images from Jerusalem to Caesarea. [_AJ_ XVIII 55-59] He surrounds the Jews with his armed soldiers and threatens to kill them immediately if they persist in the riot and do not return to their homes. ^59^ The Jews prostrated themselves with their faces to the ground and, baring their necks, said that they gladly accepted death rather than transgress the wisdom of their laws. Pilate, amazed at his steadfastness in observing the law, immediately moved the images from Jerusalem to Caesarea. [_AJ_ XVIII 55-59]

## Pilate builds an aqueduct with sacred money 

Josephus places this event in his narration before speaking of the death of Jesus, so it seems that it happened during Jesus' lifetime, although it is strange that it is not mentioned in the gospels, unless It may be that this event and the one glimpsed in Lk 13:1-2 are the same. 

The personal conclusion that I draw is that this disturbance, like that of the insignia, did take place in the time of Jesus, although neither of them has been reflected in the gospels and there was a different one related to some Galileans. It seems that riots were not uncommon under Pilate, although they never had a guerrilla or popular uprising character.

> ^175^ After this, Pilate caused a new disorder, by wasting the sacred monies, called korbonas, in an aqueduct; the waters were carried from a distance of 400 stadia. At this, the people were indignant, and Pilate having appeared in Jerusalem, they surrounded his court, reproaching him with loud voices. ^176^ He, anticipating the tumult, had mixed armed soldiers among the people with the order not to use the sword, but to hit those who shouted with clubs. From the court he gave the agreed signal. ^177^ Many Jews fell under the clubbing and many others perished trampled by the Jews themselves in the flight. In the face of the massacre, the people fell silent. [BJ II 175-177]

> ^60^ Pilate built an aqueduct to Jerusalem with holy money, carrying the waters from a distance of 200 stadia. The Jews did not like this. Thousands of people gathered and shouted loudly to give up the project; some came to insult him with profanity, as happens with crowds. ^61^ He had sent a large number of soldiers dressed in the Jewish fashion, with clubs under their tunics, and scattered them among the crowd. He then ordered the Jews to withdraw. As the Jews persisted in reviling him, he gave the agreed signal. ^62^ The soldiers attacked with more violence than Pilate ordered, beating indiscriminately. The Jews showed no cowardice, despite being caught unarmed by the soldiers who had premeditatedly attacked them. Many Jews died; others withdrew wounded. Thus ended the sedition. [AJ XVIII 60-62]

## The crucifixion of Jesus 

It appears mentioned in Josephus in a passage that has provoked a bitter debate on the part of scholars, evidently because if it is authentic it is the most evident and palpable proof that Jesus actually existed and that the tradition on the form of his death is certain. It must have been quite a riot for Josephus to remember, since he later created the sect of the “Christians,” who were already known to Josephus at the time he wrote.
> ^63^ About this time there lived a wise man, if he can be called a man, because he did wonderful things and taught in such a way that the people received the truth with joy. He won over many Jews and many Greeks. ^64^ He was the Messiah. When Pilate, on accusations from our chiefs, condemned him to the cross, he was not abandoned by his followers. On the third day he appeared to them risen as the prophets of God had foretold of him, this and other wonderful things. The group that has taken from him the name of Christians has not disappeared until today. [AJ XVIII 63-64] 

## Conclusions on Josephus

Guevara's conclusions about these passages is that the events that occurred during the Jewish rebellion cannot be extrapolated to the time of Jesus. Josephus seems to speak of two times: “they filled the country with immediate disorders and sowed the roots of the evils that made themselves felt later.”

That is to say, after the revolt of Judas Galileo, the only one that occurred in the time of Jesus, which was bitterly put down, there came a period of tranquility or rather of clandestine and shadowy struggle. The revolutionaries did not throw themselves against the established power again. Throughout the life of Jesus, the Jews sought peaceful ways to demonstrate against the Roman power. Only some time later, more than twenty years later, did that seed of the Judas revolt germinate, with the revolutionaries reappearing as a group totally committed to armed struggle.

> In the sentence there is a clear opposition between immediate and later; in the original text appears παρόν-αΰθις. The image of planting the roots hints at a late post-term effect; After the disorders immediately provoked by the rebellion, the roots remained, whose fruits were perceived later. The phrase suggests that after the rebellion there was a recess, a period of calm; it does not say that the disorders continued uninterruptedly. [Guevara, p. 75]

> During the mandate of Pontius Pilate, the most important for our research, two episodes of serious tension occurred between the Roman prefect and the Jews. The Jewish reaction is characterized in both moments and, what is very remarkable, in both versions as resistance to a specific measure of the Roman magistrate, but not as an attempt to recover the freedom of the nation. They neither resort to violent means nor do revolutionary groups appear. It is true that the Jewish reaction in the first episode was more orderly and respectful; but in the second, the Jews did not do violence, but suffered it. [Guevara, p. 108] 

## Philo of Alexandria

He is the most contemporary writer of the time of Jesus. He was born in 20 BC and died between 45 and 50 AD. He belonged to a financial aristocratic family from Alexandria. The purpose of his writings was to unify the best of the Jewish faith and Greek philosophy. He wrote his book Legatio ad Caium shortly after Caligula's assassination, to convince Claudius that the success of his rule would depend on his policy towards the Jews. 

This writing mentions as an example for Caesar of the respect that Tiberius had towards Jewish customs an event of some shields that is not mentioned in Josephus.

> Tiberius... appointed Pilate governor of Judea. This one, not so much to honor Tiberius as to vex the Jewish people, placed in Herod's palace, located in the Holy City, some golden shields that did not have any image or anything prohibited, but only an inscription that mentioned the name of who built them and the name of him to whom they were dedicated. [_Legatio_ 299] 

> When the people found out, and it was known immediately, she took as spokespersons the four sons of the king, who had royal dignity, and, accompanied by the notables and principals, she asked that the law not continue to be violated with those shields, that the ancestral customs that had been religiously observed throughout the previous centuries by emperors and kings be respected. [_Legacy_ 300]

> Do not incite the people to rebellion, do not make war on us, do not end peace. Don't use Tiberius as a pretext to outrage our people. The emperor does not want to end our customs. If you say otherwise, then show us the order or decree of Tiberius so that, not bothering you, we can send an embassy to our lord. [_Legatio_, 301] 

Pilate, hearing about the embassy that he could accuse him before the emperor, was exasperated but did not remove the shields (_Legatio_, 302). Then the leading Jews wrote a missive to Tiberius, who angrily replied to Pilate to remove the shields immediately and move them to Caesarea (_Legatio_ 303-305).

The conclusion is once again the same as that reached with the data from Josephus: the Jewish people appear as a single united voice that appeals to the authority of the emperor and begs respect for their customs through peaceful diplomatic channels. 

It is also interesting to note that this event is often considered different from the event with the regalia mentioned in Josephus, which indicates that Josephus limited himself to recording only those events that were most remarkable to him, but probably more happened. 

## P. Cornelius Tacitus

Born around 55/56 AD Roman aristocrat with a great career in administration: first _vigintivir_ or _tribunus lacticlavius_ with Emperor Vespasian, quaestor during the reign of Titus, tribune or aedile under Domitian, praetor around 88 AD, consul under Nerva in the 97 AD and finally proconsul of Asia around 112/113 AD. 

He wrote two great books, Histories, dealing with the history of the Flavian emperors, and Annals, whose theme is the Jewish-Claudian dynasty.

The only mentions he makes of Jewish subjects are in Book V of his Histories, but everything he mentions is outside the period of Jesus' public life. It is also curious that he only mentions violent events before and after: an uprising led by a certain Simon just after the death of King Herod, the tension caused by the statue Caligula ordered erected in the temple, and finally the open rebellion during the procuracy of Gesio Floro. 

Guevara's conclusion is that the absence of mentions of violent acts during the period related to Jesus is clearly saying that this period was devoid of such events. 

## Jewish writings of the time

Guevara mentions several books that were written around the time of Jesus: Book 1 of Enoch or Ethiopian Enoch, the Book of Jubilees, the Psalms of Solomon, and the Testament of Moses. These writings all contain a reflection of the apocalyptic mentality of this generation. This movement, contrary to what its current meaning seems to denote, had as its center of gravity a hopeful illusion for the immediate future. According to the apocalyptic, there was a certainty that the time of tribulations and foreign domination to which the Jewish people had been subjected for so many centuries was going to end shortly to make way for a new era of peace and prosperity, thanks to the liberating intervention of God and of a special being, the Messiah.

Of all the books mentioned, it is worth pausing, as Guevara does, on the Psalms of Solomon. In the many verses it can be understood that the promised divine intervention was seen not as an armed struggle, but as a war on a spiritual plane, as the expression “with the word of his mouth” suggests. 

> ^21^ Look at it, Lord, and raise up for them a king, a son of David, at the time you choose, O God, for your servant to reign in Israel. 

> ^22^ Surround him with strength, to break the unjust princes, to purify Jerusalem from the Gentiles who trample it underfoot, destroying it, 

> ^23^ to expel with your righteous wisdom the sinners of your inheritance, to break the pride of the sinful as a potter's vessel,

> ^24^ to crush his whole being with a rod of iron, to annihilate the impious nations with the word of his mouth, 

> ^25^ so that before his threat the Gentiles flee from his presence and to convict sinners with the testimony of their hearts. 

> ^ 26 ^ he will Gather (the King) a holy people whom he will lead with justice; he will rule the tribes of the people sanctified by the Lord his God. 

> ^ 27 ^ he will not allow injustice to settle among them, nor will any man dwell there who commits evil, for he will know that they are all sons of God. 

> ^ 28 ^ he will divide them into his tribes on earth; the emigrant and the foreigner will no longer dwell among them; 

> ^ 29 ^ he will judge peoples and nations with just wisdom.

> ^30^ He will force the Gentile peoples to serve under his yoke; He will glorify the Lord in the sight of all the earth, and he will purify Jerusalem with his sanctification, as at the beginning, 

> ^31^ so that people from the ends of the earth may come to contemplate his glory, bringing his children as gifts, bereft of her strength, to behold the glory of the Lord, with which God adorned her. 

> ^32^ He will be over them a just King, instructed by God; there is no injustice during his reign over them, because they are all holy and his King is the anointed of the Lord. 

> ^ 33 ^ he will not trust horses, riders or bows; nor will he lay up gold and silver for war, nor in the day of battle will he increase the hopes of him the multitude of his warriors.

> ^34^ The Lord is your King. His hope is that of the strong who hopes in God. He will have mercy on all nations that live before Him in religious fear. 

> ^ 35 ^ he will strike the earth continually with the word of his mouth, but he will bless the Lord's people with wisdom and joy. 

Basically the background refrain seems to be the same in these psalms. The Messiah, when he arrives, will not require armed struggle, because it will be so miraculous that only with his voice his enemies will fall to the ground. That is to say, it is a somewhat peaceful vision, in a way, of a possible popular liberation. These verses are from Psalm 17 of the Psalms of Solomon, and it is dated to the time of Pompey, not many years before the birth of Jesus.

The rest of the Jewish literature from the time of Jesus that has come down to our days does not seem to contain more information that clarifies the prevailing mentality on the issue of the use or not of violence against the occupation. That is, literature that falls into the group known as “Qumran literature,” or literature found next to an ancient Jewish monastery, rabbinical literature or writings after the time of Jesus by the rabbis, and Targumic literature or translations. with commentaries on the Torah, also from a later period, none offer interesting qualitative data on historical events that occurred at that time. It seems as if all the relevant historical data were contained in the accounts of the historians already stated. 

But there is something else...

## Christian writings 

It is interesting to take a look at the New Testament and the writings of the first Christians that have come down to us. After all, they are also writers who comment on the time of Jesus, and who even do so more than their Jewish contemporaries. 

## Acts of the Apostles 

The evangelist Luke drops precious data in his account of the Acts of the Apostles. In the passage Acts 5, 21-33 he tells how the apostles had to appear before the Sanhedrin, where they were interrogated and pressured to abandon their missionary activity in the name of Jesus. The discussion that was provoked was softened thanks to the advice of the teacher Gamaliel I. The rabbi brought to the minds of the attendees two events that must have been very present in the auditorium:

> ^36^ Some time ago Theudas got up, who thought he was someone, and about four hundred men followed him. They executed him and all his followers disbanded and everything came to nothing. ^37^ After him, on the occasion of the census, Judas Galileo emerged, dragging the people after him; he too perished, and all his followers were scattered. [Acts 5:36.37] 

The two revolts that Luke mentions are from the time of Jesus. We already know that of Judas Galileo, it is the one that Flavio Josephus mentions in _AJ_ XVIII 1-10, but also here we are offered the final result: Judas was executed and his followers were dispersed. And it is also indicated, supporting _AJ_ and contravening _BJ_, that the rebellion was caused by a census (Josephus said that it was a census of goods, not people) and not for the payment of a tribute.

The one we did not know was that of Teudas. And this is so because the only source that explicitly mentions a Theudas is Josephus in _AJ_ XX, 97-99, whose description of the rebel and the results seem to coincide very well with the data given by Lucas. Historians debate whether Lucas was wrong or not, because the Theudas that Josephus mentions is from the time of the procurator Cuspio Fado (44-46 AD) while Lucas places his Theudas at a time before Judas Galileo, whose rebellion occurred at the time of the appointment of Quirinus as consul in Syria (6-7 AD). In any case, it would be a rebellion or provoked at the death of Herod I, or well after the death of Jesus, and therefore outside the time of our interest. Nevertheless,

## Luke 13, 1-5 

It is the only passage in the gospels that clearly mentions an altercation in the time of Pontius Pilate, and by appearance, it does not seem to coincide with any of those mentioned by Josephus. 

> ^ 1 ^ At that moment some came to tell him about those Galileans, whom Pilate had put to death, mixing his blood with that of the sacrifices they were offering. ^2^ Jesus said to them: -- Do you think that those Galileans died like this because they were more sinful than the others? ^3^ I tell you no; moreover, if you do not convert, you too will perish in the same way. ^4^ And those eighteen who died when the tower of Siloam collapsed on them, do you think they were more guilty than the other inhabitants of Jerusalem? ^5^ I tell you no; and if you do not convert, you will all perish alike. [Lk 13:1-5]

The passage is truly intriguing, since it seems that those Galileans whom Pilate executed did not find favor with the people. It seems as if the people consider them sinners. But what did these men do so that they did not obtain the favor of their people? 

## _The Urantia Book_? 

Although I am not trying to include _The Urantia Book_ here as a historical document, it may be helpful in shaping a new idea about these scattered and contradictory passages we have from the sources.

The event of Lk 13:1-5 is mentioned in the same words in [UB 166:4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p4). It does not offer us much more information about this event. But the extraordinarily interesting passage is [UB 185:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1). It is worth reproducing this section in its entirety here.

> If Pontius Pilate had not been a reasonably good governor of the minor provinces, Tiberius would hardly have allowed him to remain ten years as procurator of Judea. Although he was a reasonably good administrator, he was morally a coward. He was not a big enough man to understand the nature of his task as ruler of the Jews. He failed to grasp the fact that these Hebrews had a real religion, a faith for which they were willing to die, and that millions upon millions of them, scattered here and there throughout the empire, regarded Jerusalem as the sanctuary of their faith. and they respected the Sanhedrin as the highest court in the land. [UB 185:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_1)

> Pilate did not love the Jews, and this deep hatred began to manifest itself very soon. Of all the Roman provinces, none was more difficult to govern than Judea. Pilate never really understood the problems involved in the administration of the Jews and for this reason, from the beginning of his experience as governor, he made a series of near-fatal and near-suicidal blunders. These mistakes were what gave the Jews so much power over him. When they wanted to influence his decisions, all they had to do was threaten him with insurrection, and Pilate quickly capitulated. This apparent indecision, or lack of moral courage of the procurator, was mainly due to the memory of a series of controversies that he had had with the Jews, and in each case they had been the ones who had won. The Jews knew that Pilate was afraid of them, that he feared for his position with Tiberius, and they used this knowledge to the great detriment of the governor on numerous occasions. [UB 185:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_2)

> Pilate's disadvantage with the Jews came as a result of a series of unfortunate encounters. In the first place, he failed to take seriously the deep Jewish prejudice against all images, considered as symbols of idolatry. Therefore, he allowed his soldiers to enter Jerusalem without removing the images of Caesar from their banners, as the Roman soldiers had been in the habit of doing under his predecessor. A large delegation of Jews waited for Pilate for five days, imploring him to have these images removed from the military banners. He steadfastly refused to grant his request and threatened them with immediate death. A skeptic himself, Pilate did not understand that men with strong religious feelings would not hesitate to die for their religious convictions; so, he was dismayed when those Jews gathered defiantly before his palace, bowed their heads to the ground, and sent word that they were prepared to die. Pilate then understood that he had made a threat that he did not want to carry out. He relented, and ordered the images to be removed from the banners of his soldiers in Jerusalem; from that day forward he found himself largely subject to the whims of the Jewish leaders, who had thus discovered his weakness, that of making threats which he feared to carry out. [UB 185:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_3) He relented, and ordered the images to be removed from the banners of his soldiers in Jerusalem; from that day forward he found himself largely subject to the whims of the Jewish leaders, who had thus discovered his weakness, that of making threats which he feared to carry out. [UB 185:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_3) He relented, and ordered the images to be removed from the banners of his soldiers in Jerusalem; from that day forward he found himself largely subject to the whims of the Jewish leaders, who had thus discovered his weakness, that of making threats which he feared to carry out. [UB 185:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_3)

> Pilate later decided to regain his lost prestige and consequently had the emperor's shields, such as those generally used to worship Caesar, placed on the walls of Herod's palace in Jerusalem. When the Jews protested, he was adamant. As he refused to listen to their protests, the Jews quickly appealed to Rome, and the emperor just as quickly ordered the offending shields to be removed. And Pilate then enjoyed much less esteem than before. [UB 185:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_4)

> Another thing that earned him great disapproval among the Jews was the fact that he dared to take money from the temple treasury to finance the construction of a new aqueduct, in order to provide a greater water supply to the millions of visitors from Jerusalem in times of great religious festivals. The Jews believed that only the Sanhedrin could spend the temple funds, and they never stopped lashing out at Pilate for this arbitrary order. This decision provoked no less than twenty riots and much bloodshed. The last of these serious disturbances consisted of the massacre of a large group of Galileans while they were worshiping at the altar. [UB 185:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_5)

> It is significant to note that although this indecisive Roman ruler sacrificed Jesus out of fear of the Jews and to safeguard his personal position, he was ultimately deposed as a result of an unnecessary slaughter of Samaritans in connection with the claims of a false Messiah who had led some troops to Mount Gerizim, where he claimed the temple vessels were buried; and violent riots broke out when he failed to reveal the hiding place of the sacred vessels, as he had promised. As a result of this episode, the Syrian legate ordered Pilate to return to Rome. Tiberius died while Pilate was on his way to Rome, and he was not reappointed procurator of Judea. He never fully recovered from the pitiful conviction he made by consenting to the crucifixion of Jesus. Finding no favor in the eyes of the new emperor, he retired to the province of Lausanne, where he subsequently committed suicide. [UB 185:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_6)

> Claudia Prócula, Pilate's wife, had heard much about Jesus from her servant, a Phoenician who believed in the gospel of the kingdom. After Pilate's death, Claudia identified prominently with spreading the good news. [UB 185:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_7) 

> All of this explains a large part of what happened this tragic Friday morning. It is easy to understand why the Jews dared to give orders to Pilate—to make him get up at six in the morning to try Jesus—and also why they did not hesitate to threaten him with treason before the emperor if he dared to do so. refuse their requests to execute Jesus. [UB 185:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_8)

> A worthy Roman governor, who had not been unfavorably involved with the leaders of the Jews, would never have allowed these bloodthirsty religious fanatics to bring about the death of a man whom he himself had declared without fault and innocent of the false accusations . Rome made a big mistake, a momentous mistake in earthly affairs, when she sent the mediocre Pilate as governor of Palestine. Tiberius should have sent the best provincial administrator in the empire to the Jews. [UB 185:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/185#p1_9)

According to _The Urantia Book_ a fair amount of rioting occurred during the rule of Pontius Pilate. However, there were four of special importance, three of them mentioned in an identical way by Flavius ​​Josephus and one mentioned in the same way by Philo. 

The first was the image of Caesar on the banners of his troops entering Jerusalem, which matches the account of the banner incident. 

The second was the placement of shields on the walls of the temple in Jerusalem, an event mentioned by Philo.

The third was the use of sacred money from the temple, without authorization from the Sanhedrin, to finance the construction of an aqueduct. It is also mentioned by Josephus, but the historian mentions an incident due to a protest outside the temple. The novelty is that _The Urantia Book_ connects this fact with the event of the massacre of the Galileans mentioned in Lk 13. Simply, what _The Urantia Book_ says is that this event had many more implications, causing more than twenty disturbances, the last of which was a massacre of Galileans who were worshiping at the altar, the event mentioned by Luke. 

The fourth, which caused the removal of Pilate, occurred after the death of Jesus, and was a massacre of Samaritans.

On the event of the Galileans, I tend to develop my own hypothesis. Probably these Galileans, or all or some of them, were followers of the “fourth sect”, that of the Zealots, and had caused some disturbance when entering the temple, possibly rebuking the soldiers who were located at the doors. This provoked the wrath of the prefect, who was already very heated over the matter of the temple money, and in a fit of rage he ordered that they be executed right there, next to the altar. In the end some Galileans died through no fault of their own, which is why Jesus speaks of them as “sinners.” Actually nobody considered them such, but Jesus seems to be using the typical expression that in the end “just pay for sinners.” In _The Urantia Book_, Jesus' speech is recorded more fully in [UB 166:4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p4).

## In summary 

The time of Jesus' adult life was a tense time, where conflict with the authorities was the order of the day. But it cannot be affirmed that it was a time of insurrection, full of violence, and where there was a guerrilla group that spent the day carrying out murders and riots. This did happen during Jesus' childhood, although he spent a long time living in Egypt and did not suffer that, and also after his death, until the open war against Rome in the year 66.

But the time of his ministry, almost all under the government of Pilate in Judea and Samaria, of Herod Antipas in Galilee and Perea, and of Herod Philip in Iturea, Gaulanitide and Auranitide, was marked only by a peaceful desire on the part of his countrymen to resolve the inevitable disputes with the Roman authority. 

This was precisely what allowed Jesus to preach freely and circulate without problems throughout the nation touring towns and cities. If he had lived in an environment of tension, confrontation and violence, such insecurity would not have made so many trips prudent.

But there is a major conclusion to be drawn from all the readings carried out, and that is the fact that there was not only a group in Jesus' time, Josephus speaks of a sect, that proposed the use of weapons, but also one or several groups that proposed on the contrary, the peaceful use of deterrence and the use of Roman legal channels. These groups, which we will see appear in our story, have been strangely silenced from the pages of history. They do not appear under a common name, but they had radical importance despite their anonymity.

# Hellenism versus Judaism 

During the centuries before the birth of Jesus, the Jewish nation had gone through times of expansion and regression. Jewish culture was impregnated with Hellenic culture for many years until the Maccabean rebellion initiated a clear retreat from Hellenism in favor of Judaism. Some time later, when the Romans took control of the area, Judaism experienced a new setback.

The great dream of Alexander the Great was to found a universal empire unified not only by a single government, but also by a single language, customs and culture. It is what is known as Hellenism, and it spread to the death of the Macedonian conqueror like a trail throughout the East and West. New cities inhabited solely by Greeks were founded, and the old ones also received an incessant influx of Hellenes. 

Alexander's successors continued his work by carrying Hellenism throughout Asia and the West. The Middle East, at least the wealthy classes, was totally impregnated with Hellenic culture. Palestine also suffered this process. Greek civilization advanced everywhere.

Many cities were forcibly cultured into one form of government or another. In the time of Jesus, cities that were clearly Jewish, as well as clearly Hellenic or foreign-oriented cities, as well as intermediate situations, coexisted in the middle of Jewish territory.

During all this time from the Maccabees in 166 a. From C. until the Roman and Herodian rule, the Jewish population was always divided into two irreconcilable factions. There was a pro-Greek party that was prepared to assume certain Hellenic customs, even in religious worship, in order to preserve a lasting peace with Syria, the conquering kingdom, and later with Rome. And then there were the pious Jews, the Hasidim or Hasidim, who were the instigators of an entire rebellion being formed around one family, the Maccabees, named after their most prominent member, Judas the “Maccabee.” Judas's nickname meant “the Hammer,” and they were willing to take up arms and wage open war against the invader in order to keep their religious customs intact. They were even willing to make an exception for the Sabbath and fight on this day when all work was prohibited. The excesses of the Syrian rulers provoked the Jewish people in such a way that, united under the leadership of the Maccabean family, they achieved important military successes and expanded the boundaries of the Jewish nation as they had never been before and as they will never be again. never, because the Roman domination cut that extension considerably.

These two parties continued through all the years before the age up to the time of Jesus. After Syrian domination ended, Roman rule was not much different. During this time, two opposing parties also emerged, one of a Hellenistic tendency, within which we could classify the Sadducees, and another, such as the Zealot or jealous party, heir to the Hasidians, of a nationalist tendency. The Pharisees were also born into the bosom of the Hasidians. Jesus all his life had to live in this dual scenario of the existence of cities or groups with a marked Hellenic tendency or a strong Jewish character, or else in intermediate situations, such as those lived in many Galilean towns. The truth is that the Maccabees, who began their domain within a strict Jewish purity, With the passage of time and generations, they became more and more a party influenced by Greek customs and closer to the Sadducees. The truth is that at the time of Jesus it would not be possible to say which party or position was the more influential of the two.

Hellenization did not affect all areas of Jewish territory equally. We can take a geographical and historical review of the different regions to understand the differences between them. 

## Judea and the coastal cities

At the beginning of the Maccabean period the Jewish population was reduced only to Judea, a small province surrounded by non-Jewish peoples[^1]. At that time the Jewish cities that marked the borders of Judea were: Lida, Ramatáyim (Arimatea) and Ephraim to the north; the Jordan River and Jericho to the east; Bet-Zur at the southern tip; and Lydda, Adida (Hadid), and Emmaus to the west, far from the sea, for all the coastal cities, such as Raphia, Gaza, Antedon, Ashkelon[^2], and Ashdod, were Gentiles. Alexander Jannaeus, the Maccabean descendant, captured Raphia, Gaza and Antedon, but this did not imply a profound conversion to Judaism. These coastal cities, when restored by Pompey and the Roman consul Gabinius, kept their Greek culture. Other coastal cities such as Joppa, Dora, and Acre (Ptolemais), also remained Greek. jope, Seat of the myth of Perseus and Andromeda, it had a Macedonian garrison in the time of the Diadochi (heirs of Alexander). Even Gazara (Gezer), inland, was gentile. It is also true that in the time of Jesus the towns of Joppa and Jamnia began to have a significant Jewish population, but even so they were never part of Judea, which meant that the Jewish state never had access to the sea.

Flavius ​​Josephus in the time of Jesus placed a northern limit for Judea in the town of Anuathu Borcaeus, a few kilometers south of Siquén, the religious capital of Samaria. The northernmost toparchy or administrative boundary was Acrabatta, and another town on the northern boundary was Coreas or Coreae, a little north of the fortress of Alexandrion. As for the southern limit, he placed it at Arad (the present ruins of Tel Arad), far to the south of Hebron, and the southernmost toparchies were Idumea and En-Gedi. One of the southernmost Jewish towns was Malata. 

## Idumea

The south of Judea, Idumea, was conquered by John Hyrcanus, Maccabean heir. The towns of Adora and Marisa were forced to convert to Judaism and have been Jewish ever since. But the conversion did not affect the entire population. Many of the wealthy families still maintained their Hellenistic tastes and customs. King Herod's family, for example, came from there, and although he tried to avoid violating Jewish prescriptions throughout his life, they were often in favor of Hellenic culture. In Adora, in fact, Apollo was venerated and it was one of the cities restored by the Roman consul Gabinius; and Marisa always inhabited an important Greek colony that motivated Pompey to liberate the city. 

## Samaria

Further inland, Samaria was colonized by Alexander the Great or by Perdiccas, Alexander's chief diadochus. It was always occupied by Samaritans, that is, Jews who respected Jewish law but who considered themselves racially different from Jews, and above all they did not venerate the temple in Jerusalem but one of their own. Alexander the Great established Macedonian settlers there, so that along with Samaritans and Greeks, Samaria had a small minority of Jews. 

## Galilee

Scitopolis was a Greek city from the earliest times; and the Paneion, the shrine to the god Pan situated at the sources of the Jordan, where Caesarea Philippi was later built, was clearly a Greek temple. On Lake Tiberias there were Greek cities such as Philotheria, perhaps named after a sister of Ptolemy II Philadelphus, and the cities of Hippos, Gadara, Pella, and Dion, near the lake, were undoubtedly Greek. 

## Eastern Galilee (Gaulanitide, Batanea, Traconitide, and Auranitide)

The east of the Sea of ​​Galilee was also not 100% Jewish territory. These places, known as Gaulanítide, Batanea, Traconítide and Auranítide, had a mixed population of Jews and Syrians. Furthermore, until the time of Herod there were many bands of nomads, often robbers, who took refuge in caves and lived somewhat wildly. Only long after Jesus did those places, such as Kanatha[^3] and the Hauran area, become influenced by a growing community of Gentile settlers who were forced into the area to displace these nomads. 

## Perea

Gerasa and Philadelphia, in Transjordan, were also cities founded in the time of Alexander. Only one redoubt east of the Jordan remained in Jewish power in Maccabean times, the territory called Perea. But it was a little arable area in which the Jews never settled intensively. Pella, just on the northern border, had a mixed community of Jews and Gentiles. Amatus, Adam and Machaero could be considered Jewish, but further south from Machaero, like Medeba, it was quickly becoming Nabataean territory. 

## Notes 

[^1]: To position the populations that are discussed, it is recommended to use the maps of Palestine that are available together with these articles.

[^2]: Raphia, Gaza, Antedon and Ashkelon were cities further south of Ashdod, on the coast, and do not appear on the maps of Palestine indicated above because they are far to the south. 

[^3]: Kanatha also does not appear on the maps of Palestine available with these items. It would be located far to the east on the road that starts from Edrei to the east. Despite how far it was from Jewish territory, it was an important town that, due to its strategic position for the Romans, came to have several cohorts called Canathenorum.

# Medicine in antiquity 

## Mesopotamian medicine

The “land between two rivers” was home to some of the first and most important human civilizations (Sumerian, Akkadian, Assyrian and Babylonian) since the Neolithic. Around four thousand years before our era, the first Sumerian cities were established in this territory and for more than three thousand years these four cultures flourished, characterized by the use of a written language (cuneiform) that has been preserved to this day in Numerous tablets and engravings. It is precisely this ability to transmit information, scientific, social and administrative, through a lasting system that determined the cultural development of the first Sumerian settlements, and what allowed later historians to reconstruct their legacy.

The main evidence of the way of life of the Mesopotamian civilizations is found in the Code of Hammurabi, a compilation of laws and administrative regulations collected by the Babylonian king Hammurabi, carved in a block of diorite about 2.50 m high by 1 .90 m base and placed in the temple of Sippar. It determines through thirteen articles, the responsibilities incurred by doctors in the exercise of their profession, as well as the punishments provided in case of malpractice.

Thanks to this text and a set of some thirty thousand tablets compiled by Ashurbanipal (669-626 BC), from the library discovered in Nineveh by Henry Layarde in 1841, it has been possible to intuit the conception of health and disease in this period, as well as well as the medical techniques used by its professional healers. Of all these tablets, some 800 are specifically dedicated to medicine, and among them is the description of the first known recipe. The most striking thing is the intricate social organization around taboos and religious and moral obligations, which determined the destiny of the individual. A supernatural conception of the disease prevailed: this was a divine punishment imposed by different demons after the breaking of some taboo. In this way, the first thing the doctor had to do was identify which of the approximately six thousand possible demons was the cause of the problem. For this they used divinatory techniques based on the study of the flight of birds, the position of the stars or the liver of some animals. The disease was called _shêrtu_. But this Assyrian word also meant sin, moral impurity, divine wrath, and punishment.

Any god could cause illness through direct intervention, abandoning man to his fate, or through enchantments performed by sorcerers. During healing all these gods could be invoked and required through prayers and sacrifices to withdraw their harmful influence and allow the healing of the sick man. Among all the pantheon of gods, Ninazu was known as “the lord of medicine” because of his special relationship with health.

The diagnosis then included a series of ritual questions to determine the origin of the illness: “Have you set the father against the son? Or the son against the father? You lied? Have you cheated on the weight of the balance? And the treatments did not escape this cultural pattern: exorcisms, prayers and offerings are frequent healing rituals that seek to ingratiate the patient with the divinity or rid him of the demon that stalks him. However, it is also worth noting an important herbal arsenal collected in several tablets: some two hundred and fifty healing plants are collected in them, as well as the use of some minerals and various substances of animal origin.

The generic name for the doctor was asû, but some variants can be found such as the _bârû_, or diviner in charge of the ritual interrogation; the _âshipu_, specialized in exorcisms; or the _gallubu_, a lower-caste barber-surgeon who anticipates the figure of the medieval European barber, and who finds a counterpart in other cultures (such as the Aztec _Tepatl_). This healer was in charge of simple surgical operations (tooth extraction, abscess drainage, phlebotomies...).

In the Louvre Museum you can see a Babylonian alabaster seal more than four thousand years old with a legend that mentions the first known name of a doctor: "O Edinmungi, servant of the god Girra, protector of the women in labor, Ur-Lugal-edin-na, the doctor, is your servant!” This seal, used to sign documents and recipes, represents two knives surrounded by medicinal plants. 

The Persian invasion of 539 BC marked the end of the Babylonian empire, but we must go back again some three thousand years to mention the other great civilization of the ancient Near East with a written language and a remarkably advanced medical culture: the egyptian 

## Egyptian medicine

During the long three thousand years of ancient Egyptian history, a long, varied and fruitful medical tradition developed. Herodotus came to call the Egyptians the people of the most holy, due to the remarkable public health system that they possessed, and the existence of “a doctor for each disease” (first reference to specialization in medical fields). In Homer's Odyssey, Egypt is described as a country “whose fertile land produces many drugs” and where “every man is a doctor.” Egyptian medicine largely maintains a magical conception of illness, but begins to develop a practical interest in fields such as anatomy, public health or clinical diagnosis, which represent an important advance in the way of understanding how to get sick.

The climate of Egypt has favored the preservation of numerous papyri with medical references written in hieroglyphic (_hierós_, sacred, and _glypho_, engrave, i.e. “the sacred words”) or hieratic writing: 

* The Ramesseum papyri (1900 BC), in which recipes and magical formulas are described. 
* The Kahun papyrus (1850 BC), which deals with subjects as disparate as obstetrics, veterinary or arithmetic.
* The Ebers papyrus (1550 BC), one of the most important and longest written documents found from ancient Egypt: it is more than twenty meters long and about a foot high and contains 877 sections describing numerous diseases in various fields of medicine such as: ophthalmology, gynecology, gastroenterology... and their corresponding prescriptions. This papyrus includes the first written reference to tumors.
* The Edwin Smith papyrus (1650 BC), with mainly surgical content. The medical information contained in the Edwin Smith papyrus includes the examination, diagnosis, treatment and prognosis of numerous pathologies, with special dedication to various surgical techniques and anatomical descriptions, obtained in the course of the embalming and mummification processes of the corpses. . In this papyrus three degrees of prognosis are established for the first time, similar to that of modern medicine: favorable, doubtful and unfavourable. 
* The Hearst papyrus (1550 BC), which contains medical and surgical descriptions and some magisterial formulas. 
* The papyrus of London (1350 BC), where magical recipes and rituals intermingle.
* The Berlin papyri (the “book of the heart”) (1300 BC) which fairly accurately detail some cardiac pathologies. 
* The Chester Beatty Medical Papyrus (1300 BC), assorted recipe book. 
* The Carlsberg papyrus (1200 BC) on obstetric and ophthalmological issues. 

Among the numerous anatomical descriptions offered by Egyptian texts, those related to the heart and the circulatory system should be highlighted, collected in the treatise “The doctor's secret: knowledge of the heart”, incorporated in the Edwin Smith papyrus: "The heart is a mass of flesh, origin of life and center of the vascular system (...) Through the pulse the heart speaks through the vessels to all the members of the body.»

The first references belong to the early monarchical period (2700 BC). According to Manetho, an Egyptian priest and historian, Atotis or Aha, pharaoh of the first dynasty, practiced the art of medicine, writing treatises on the technique of opening bodies. The writings of Imhotep, vizier of Pharaoh Necherjet Dyeser, priest, astronomer, doctor and first known architect also date from that time. Such was his fame as a healer that he ended up deified, considering himself the Egyptian god of medicine. Other well-known doctors of the Old Kingdom (from 2500 to 2100 BC) were Sachmet (physician of pharaoh Sahura) or Nesmenau, director of one of the houses of life,

Various gods watch over the practice of medicine: Thoth, god of wisdom; Sekhmet, goddess of mercy and health; Duau and Horus, protectors of specialists in ocular medicine; Tueris, Heget and Neit, protectors of pregnant women at the time of childbirth; or Imhotep himself after being deified. 

There is evidence of medical institutions in ancient Egypt at least from the first dynasty. In these institutions, already in the nineteenth dynasty, their employees had certain benefits (medical insurance, pensions and sick leave), and their working hours were eight hours.

The first known female physician, Peseshet, who practiced her activity during the fourth dynasty, was also Egyptian; In addition to her supervisory role, Peseshet evaluated midwives at a medical school in Sais. 

Medicine in ancient Egypt was taught in the houses of life attached to the temples. In them special care was carried out for the sick and doctors were specifically trained through practices controlled by the priests, practices that they then exercised with the clientele.

The disease was the physical demonstration of a possession of the patient's body by supernatural agents: enemies having access to magical power, an angry god, some disgruntled deceased, etc. That is why doctors and enchanters worked in parallel: first it was the enchanter and then the doctor. 

The body wrap is a necessary element to achieve eternal life, and its destruction would prevent achieving it. The worst possible situation for an ancient Egyptian was to die by drowning or incineration, whereupon his body would be lost.

The worldview of the 21st century leads us to think of Egyptian medicine by comparing it with current services, but the first thing that needs to be taken into account is the fact that, as far as we know, the system depended on the temple, which was seen as an institution.

The medical care system of the ancient Egyptians was a public service with the following characteristics: free, therefore, accessible to all; general, for all social classes; national, available throughout the country; available at any time. It is part of a more general service to the community, which cared for the irrigation canals, education, justice, grain reserves, everything necessary for the population of Egypt, and is under the authority of the temple. In the house of life, the temple manages, among others, the school of the scribes, open to all, which trains future scribes but only keeps the best for itself. It also ensures the training of doctors and priests. This institution also manages the places of medical care within the temple, and especially a care space,

Sanitary laws were strict, hygiene was scrupulously followed and there were medical ordinances to monitor the waters, not only for cleaning the living but also for mortuary hygiene. All this indicates a high degree of evolution of medicine. 

Apparently, the rules of learning and practice were promulgated by the pharaoh's physician, who was at the top of the medical hierarchy; below him were the palace doctors, one of whom was the Chief Doctor of North and South, a kind of Minister of Health. At his command were the inspectors, supervisors and the teachers of the doctors. On a lower step were the vast majority of practical doctors.

The rules of learning and practice were dictated by the pharaoh's doctor, and they were not allowed to leave orthodoxy or use other therapeutic methods than those indicated in the manuals; Following this guideline, even if the results were not the desired ones, the doctor was free from all reproaches. This rigidity was a major obstacle to innovation and to learning from their own observations. We do not know if any of them dedicated themselves to research, although if they did, they must have been from higher ranks for their discoveries to be accepted.

There was a high degree of knowledge of the human body, in part due to the process of mummification of corpses. They only treated the diseases they could cure. This is how they classified the ailments: “This is a disease that I know and I will cure”, “This is a disease that I know and I will not treat”, “This is a disease that I do not know and I will not treat”. 

Apparently, the rules of learning and medical practice were promulgated by the pharaoh's doctor, who was at the top of the medical hierarchy: below him were the palace doctors, of whom one had to play the role supervisory. The others were medical inspectors and constituted a less important group. On a lower step were the vast majority of practical doctors.

The training of doctors was carried out in the house of life. Young students were recruited after a period of observation, and Greek doctors who arrived were also taught to complete their knowledge in Egypt, which was reputed to have the best doctors. This complement of training could last ten years. The educational system is not known, but it seems to rest on the teacher-apprentice couple. 

El papiro Ebers describe a tres tipos de médicos en la sociedad egipcia:

* Los médicos, llamados por los egipcios _sun-nu_, que quiere decir el hombre de los que sufren o están enfermos, ejercían fuera del templo. Ellos lo hacían de una manera «laica», pero según los preceptos del templo. Su dios tutelar era Dyehuty, al que los griegos llamaron Thot. Comenzaban sus prácticas como médicos itinerantes, iban a ver al paciente, y atendían una única clase de enfermedad; eran especialistas. Sólo el médico con una gran experiencia reconocida llegaba a ser generalista. Después de un período itinerante, el sun-nu podía intentar entrar en un centro de cuidados, o ejercer en su residencia.
* The doctors _uabu-sekhmet_ practiced only in the temple. For them, the practice of medicine was totally impregnated by religion, they practically practiced magic. They were dependent on the goddess Sekhmet, the goddess of healing, and knowledgeable about a wide assortment of drugs. These were the physicians of the pharaoh, the god on earth.
* The exorcist doctors, who healed through charms and amulets. 
* A class of helpers, called _ut_, who are not considered healers, assisted the medical caste in large numbers, advancing the nursing corps. 

The methods were varied. There were doctors for all parts of the body, for the spirit, for women, men, children, and even depending on the season. The case of the eye doctor, who operated cataracts, and that of a women's doctor who did the pregnancy test, including the prediction of the child's sex (Berlin papyri), have survived to posterity.

Medicine was regulated since the time of Imhotep, as testified by an inscription on a wall in Saqqara, with well-defined ethical rules that regulate the profession: the place of installation of the care centers, their supervision, supervision of the activity of the sun-nu, the estimation of their performance, disciplinary actions. He was not allowed to use therapeutic methods that were out of orthodoxy, he could only use those defined by the authority of classical treatises and in this case, even if the results obtained were not good, he was free from all reproach. 

The diagnostic system is described in the Ebers papyrus. The sequence is as follows: 

* Ask questions to the patient, in order and patiently, 
* Investigate among his relatives,
* Find the direct and indirect origin of the suffering, 
* Look for the existence of a family history, 
	In case of relapse, verify if the treatment is adequate, 
	Prepare a care plan, in the short and medium term. 
* Arriving here, the diagnosis is confused with the prescription: it becomes a detailed report that includes medical care and medications. The first thing that is tried is to prevent suffering, then stop the progress of the disease, to end up finding its elimination. 

The therapeutic means used by the Egyptians were simple, multiple and varied, surprising for today's public. They belong to different categories: 

* Medicines: there were all kinds: mineral, vegetable and animal.
* Minerals: northern salt (natron), copper chips, powdered Memphis stone (local anesthetic?), yellow ocher for burns, 
* Vegetables: there is a rich pharmacopoeia, kept as a trade secret, which makes Difficult to recognize the plants used among the current flora (the climatic evolution towards warming that has occurred since 3000 BC has modified the fauna and flora of the region, and the translation of the names is in doubt). Certain substances have not been identified, and others are a source of debate (nicotine in ancient Egypt, when tobacco arrived from America?). For example, coriander, carob, garlic, onion, acacia resin, roasted barley, etc. are identified.
* Animal products: meat (to heal wounds), honey (as a local antiseptic), wax, cobwebs (disinfectant, since it has a weak antibiotic action), cow fat, donkey milk, viscera of pig etc. 

The preparation of the medicines was done by prescription, following rigorous protocols. They were used in various ways: local preparations (ointments, plasters, ointments); prepared to be absorbed (macerated in beer); in the form of fumigations (consisting of the burning of different elements and the resulting smoke had to be inhaled).

The pharmacy was highly developed. In the Grapow and Deines papyri, up to seven hundred formulas for the preparation of remedies and perfumes are related. In the Ebers papyrus, there are up to a thousand recipes and among the most used remedies are onion, garlic, honey, beer, figs, flax seeds, fennel, myrrh, aloes, saffron, opium, lettuce; they used coffee as a stimulant and certain preparations of lead, copper, antimony. The use of purgatives was very frequent.

* Magical remedies: These were mixed media, which used excrement and magic, to provide disgusting nutrition to the spirit that invaded the body, and thus reject it. These droppings were generally donkey, crocodile, hippopotamus, pelican, cattle, flies, and even man. There were also alchemists, whose purpose was to find magical substances that cured illnesses, rejuvenated people, granted immortality, to increase sexual potency, etc. 
* Surgery: some interventions are attested, as is the probable use of analgesics and anesthetics: 
* Extraction of thorns and healing of bites (from dogs, crocodiles, lions, hippopotamuses, etc.).
* Suturing of wounds, reduction of shoulder dislocations and bone fractures by immobilizing the limbs. 
* Healing war wounds. 
* Cataract intervention, which is attested in the Ptolemaic period. The instruments used are represented on a back wall of the Kom Ombo temple. 
* Trepanation is visible in certain skulls, but the purpose of this intervention is not known. 
* Circumcision is represented in some bas-reliefs and paintings, but it is not explained, so its technique is not known. 
* Post-traumatic and punitive amputations (nose, tongue, ears, hand, etc., by court order). These techniques are collected in the Edwin Smith Papyrus.
* Music: The Kahun papyrus is also the first written testimony on the influence of music on the human body. In other previous medical papyri, there are references to the enchantment of music in women, relating it to fertility. They also cured diseases through breathing, for which they used songs in which they breathed in a certain way in the different passages. Herophilus, a physician from Alexandria, regulated the heart rate according to the musical scale.
* Drugs: the discovery of tobacco and coca components dates back to the arrival on French soil in 1976 of the royal mummy of Ramses II, due to the study carried out by the historian and Egyptologist Christiane Desroches Noblecourt. The presence of a plant belonging to the Nicotiana L. class uniformly distributed throughout the most inaccessible places of the mummy excludes the hypothesis of a trickery. It seems that the Egyptians knew about these species earlier than previously believed. The exact use of these exotic plants among Egyptian priests remains to be determined: did they have a narcotic role allowing priests to come into contact with the divinity in hallucinatory sessions? What basic principle prompted priests to use such rare and remote plants in embalming? Finally, how did they get them?

Medicine and magic were intimately linked in ancient Egypt, where illness was the result of the intervention of evil geniuses, ill-intentioned humans or other divinities. They were the messengers of Sekhmet, goddess with the head of a lioness, who spread disease and death. As she also had the power to heal, she was the goddess of physicians, who often acted as her priestess. 

Magic has a special resonance that is due to the myth of Osiris. Isis, “The Great Magician”, after having reconstructed the corpse of her divine husband, brought him back to life by means of her powerful magic, and she was “miraculously” impregnated giving birth to Horus.

Spells are often associated with the other remedies; they were incantations that a god had pronounced under analogous conditions, and were recited to ensure the efficacy of the remedy. Each illness had a precise formula to recite. 

As for prophylactic methods, to avoid the disease they had amulets, prophylactic stelae (stelae representing Horus mounted on a crocodile were considered protective against the bites and stings of poisonous animals), and images of healer gods. 

Many patients visited the sanctuaries of the healing gods, such as Imhotep and Amenhotep, both deified, in the hope of obtaining a cure. Others sought to obtain it from the sanitarium, from the temple of Hathor at Dendera, and from the temple of Hatshepsut.

The gods related to medicine were: Isis, goddess of health, inventor of remedies; Horus, often invoked in cases of animal bites; Hathor, goddess of love, protector of women; Thoth, god of the scribes and patron of ophthalmologists; Sekhmet, healing goddess; Bes, protect the sleep of sleepers and good genius of pregnant women; Selkis, protects from bites.

And the deified men: Imhotep, chaty and architect of Pharaoh Dyeser (Dynasty III), founder of Egyptian medicine, and author of the Edwin Smith papyrus about cures, ailments and anatomical observations; and Amenhotep (son of Hapu), architect of Pharaoh Amenophis III (Dynasty XVIII), was considered a kind magician who interceded before Amun and the rest of the divinities and who also had healing and protective powers. 

Egyptian obstetrics 

Min is the god of fertility, and the goddess Tueris who protects the mother and the child at the time of childbirth by scaring away evil spirits that could harm the child. She is often accompanied by the god Bes.

The goddess Hathor, goddess of motherhood and fertility, was used to come to the aid of the child and the mother, through spells: «Place barley and wheat in two canvas bags with the sand and dates; urinate on them every day; if barley and wheat germinate, she will give birth; if the barley sprouts first, it will be a boy; if wheat, he will be a woman; if they do not germinate, they will not give birth». 

But the doctors countered the idea that the pregnancy is due to the intervention of supernatural powers, gods or demons. In Egyptian papyri one finds, among spells, mythical conceptions and superstitions, an attempt at rationalization.

The Kahun Papyrus, dated to the XII Dynasty, is a precise treatise on gynecology and mentions a disease that devours tissue (cancer). Egyptian doctors had noticed the beneficial action of honey in gynecology. 

They knew contraceptive or abortive methods, described simply as “abandonment of the state of pregnancy” described in the papyri of Kahun, Ebers, Berlin, Carlsberg and Ramesseum. They consisted of various types of washing, such as the one carried out with very hot oil.

The first medical text on contraceptive methods was found in the Kahun papyri, where advice and prescriptions were found such as the use of crocodile dung mixed with a paste that served as a vehicle; irrigation with substances such as sodium carbonate. In the 14th century BC, condoms were made from animal bladders as a means of birth control. Some papyri include various recipes for intra-vaginal contraceptives, with ingredients such as acacia resin, sour milk, and acacia spikes. Compounds derived from the acacia tree have been shown to be spermicidal in modern in vitro research, with an immobilizing effect on sperm. Its use may be a consequence of the observation, by the shepherds,

Among the methods for diagnosing pregnancy was counting the number of times a woman vomited when placed on a mixture of beer and dates. This rejection of strong odors is now studied as evidence of pregnancy. 

During childbirth, which took place at home, the women crouched on four ritual bricks, which represented Mesjenet while the midwives assisted. The placenta was preserved to make medical remedies. Afterwards, the women separated for fourteen days to purify themselves, since after childbirth they were considered impure. 

There are some suggestions in certain writings that perineal tears were stitched up after childbirth, such as a papyrus referring to 'rejoining the vagina'. 

erectile dysfunction in egypt

They had remedies for her made from carob, pine, or watermelon. Current studies indicate that carob is high in histidine, a major component of histamine. Histamine-deficient mice have been shown in laboratory studies to have a low reproductive rate due to decreased male libido. 

Egyptian childcare 

The Brugsh papyrus is the oldest document we know about pediatrics. This specialty was limited to infants, the rest of the children were treated by adult doctors.

The cry and muscle tone of the newborn were used as indicators of health. The papyrus states that if the newborn said “nai” he would live, and if he said “mibi” he would die. It was also believed that if the child moaned or lowered his head, he would die. Crying and muscle tone are two of the five parameters used in the 20th century to determine the Apgar status of newborns. 

Infanticide was severely punished. The Book of the Dead includes among its prohibitions, seeking abortion. And although provoking him was legally punished, it was justified in some cases.

In cases of birth with physical malformations or with some chronic disease, infanticide was not resorted to and the children were accepted, considering that they had been touched by divine grace and were included in society with great respect. 

Egyptian ophthalmology

The knowledge of ophthalmology in ancient Egypt was limited to the pupil, the sclera and the external aspects: eyelids, eyelashes and eyebrows; the Egyptians ignored almost all the internal structure of the eye. However, ophthalmology developed, since eye diseases were very common, especially the “desert ophthalmia” known today as trachoma, still endemic in Egypt. One of the defenses against this disease was the use of _kohol_, which acted on two fronts: to reduce intense light, being black, and as an effective disinfectant, being made with antimony sulfate.

The eyelids were called the “back of the eye”, the white of the eye was already called the sclera, the iris was studied, certain texts indicate that its examination allowed the sex of the fetus to be discovered, and the pupil was called "the girl who is in the eye”, due to the image of people reflected in the cornea against the black background of the pupil. (pupil: poupée: doll). 

Despite the skill of the craftsmen of the Old Kingdom, who made perfect replicas of the eyes in glass and enamel for the statues, there is nothing to suggest that these objects were used as prosthetics.

Since the first dynasty, the texts mention the care given to the eyes, with practices mixed with magic: Thoth, God of science and medicine, is the ancestor of ophthalmologists; According to mythology, he would have replaced the eye that Horus lost in his fight against Seth, and declared “I am Thoth, the doctor of the eye of Horus.” 

Later, in the time of Pepy I of the VI Dynasty, a funerary stela depicts a man, sometimes sitting and sometimes walking, with this dedicatory inscription: "Pepy Anj Iri, head of the royal physicians, physician to the eyes of the palace, custodian of the intestinal orifice, the one who prepares documents, the one who trains scorpions».

The Ebers papyrus and the London papyrus contain several magical spells invoking Thoth, which had to be repeated several times while applying the eye drops: “He who saved the eye of Horus in his fight against Seth will be able to restore light to the sick.” of the eyes". 

egyptian dentistry

The possible dental care is not testified, the poor dental condition is known and is explained by the presence of tiny grains of sand in the flour (sand that originates from the sandstone stones that were used for grinding), responsible for dental wear important. There is an example of a dental prosthesis (two molars joined with a gold wire) that seems more like a job done to solve a problem than an aesthetic fix, but there is no other evidence, as the study of the mummies should have confirmed.

There is a fragment of the wooden panel from the tomb of Hesy-Ra in Saqqara (III dynasty), which is in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo and in which his title as chief of dentists and doctors appears. He is described as “the greatest of the doctors who treat the teeth”. It is the oldest testimony of a doctor dedicated to dentistry and dates back to 3000 BC. He was an important dignitary of Memphis from the time of Dyeser and had several other titles. His high position shows the reputation and respect enjoyed by physicians in charge of dental diseases.

We found evidence that dental treatment was separated from general medicine at the bottom of a stela commissioned by Pharaoh Sahura as a gift to his favorite physician. On it is a small figure, identified by a hieroglyphic inscription as Men-Kaura-Anj 'the man with the tooth'. 

Houi was an ancient empire healer who dealt with diseases of the teeth and anus, this makes sense considering that both the anus (protodeum) and the mouth (stomodeum) derive embryologically from the same tissue systems.

Recently there has been a lot of controversy as to whether dentists had their own separate training. It seems that there were two types of individuals dedicated to the dental arts, on the one hand those who are called «sinu = doctor», and others devoid of this denomination. 

## Hebrew Medicine

Most of the knowledge of Hebrew medicine during the first millennium BC comes from the Old Testament of the Bible. Various laws and rituals related to health are cited in it, such as isolating infected people (Lev 13:45-46), washing after handling deceased bodies (Num 19:11-19), and burying excrements away from dwellings (Dt 23:12-13). The mandates include prophylaxis and suppression of epidemics, suppression of venereal diseases and prostitution, skin care, baths, food, housing and clothing, labor regulation, sexuality, discipline, etc. Many of these commands have a rational basis, such as Sabbath rest, circumcision, dietary laws (prohibition of blood and pig), measures regarding menstruation,

## Indian Medicine 

Between 2800 and 1600 BC, in the Indus Valley (present-day Pakistan), an urban society existed with some similarities to the Sumerian city-state civilization. 

Before the 4th century BC (the date of the oldest manuscript known today) the Áiur vedá ('the truth about longevity') was written, which saw health as harmony between body, mind and spirit. The two most famous texts of this system belong to the schools of Charaka and Sushruta. According to Charaka, neither health nor illness is predetermined, and life can be lengthened with some effort. On the other hand, the Sushruta understands medicine as the set of useful techniques to cure illnesses, protect health, and prolong life.

Áiur Veda comprises eight different disciplines: _kayachikitsa_ (internal medicine), _shalyachikitsa_ (surgery and anatomy), _shalakyachikitsa_ (otolaryngology), _kaumarabhritya_ (pediatrics), _bhutavidya_ (psychiatry), _agada tantra_ (toxicology), _rasayana_ (science of rejuvenation), and _vajikarana_ (science of fertility).

In addition to the learning of these eight disciplines, the Áiur vedá required knowledge of ten essential arts for the preparation and application of medicines, namely: distillation, operational skills, cooking, horticulture, metallurgy, sugar manufacturing, pharmacy, analysis and separation. of minerals, composition of metals, and preparation of alkalis. Certain teachings were carried out during the instruction of the most important clinical subjects. For example, teaching anatomy was part of teaching surgery, learning embryology was part of training in pediatrics and obstetrics, and knowledge of physiology and pathology was derived from teaching clinical subjects. 

## Medicine in China

Traditional Chinese medicine emerges as a fundamentally Taoist way of understanding medicine and the human body. The Tao is the origin of the Universe, which is sustained in an unstable balance resulting from two primordial forces: Yin (earth, cold, feminine) and Yang (sky, heat, masculine), capable of modifying to the five elements of which the universe is made: water, earth, fire, wood and metal. This cosmological conception determines a disease model based on the rupture of the balance, and its treatment in a recovery of that fundamental balance. One of the first traces of this medicine is the Nei Jing, which is a compendium of medical writings dated around 2600 BC. and that will represent one of the pillars of traditional Chinese medicine in the following four millennia. One of the first and most important revisions is attributed to the Yellow Emperor, Huang Di. In this compendium there are some interesting medical concepts for the time, especially of a surgical nature, although the reluctance to study human corpses seems to have reduced the effectiveness of his methods. Chinese medicine developed a discipline straddling medicine and surgery called acupuncture. According to this discipline, the application of needles on any of the 365 insertion points (or up to 600 according to the schools) would restore the lost balance between Yin and Yan.

According to this discipline, the application of needles on any of the 365 insertion points (or up to 600 according to the schools) would restore the lost balance between Yin and Yan.

Several medical historians have questioned the reason why Chinese medicine remained anchored in this cosmological vision without reaching the level of “technical science” despite its long tradition and extensive body of knowledge, compared to the classical Greco-Roman model. The reason, according to these authors, would be found in the development of the concept of logos by Greek culture, as a natural explanation detached from any cosmological model (mythos). 

With the arrival of the Han dynasty (206 BC-220 AD), and with the heyday of Taoism (2nd century BC to 7th century AD), plant and mineral remedies, poisons, dietetics, as well as breathing techniques and physical exercise. From this dynasty, and until the Sui dynasty (6th century) the following sages stood out:

* Chun Yuyi: From their observations it appears that they already knew how to diagnose and treat diseases such as cirrhosis, hernias and hemoptysis. 
* Zhang Zhongjing: He was probably the first to differentiate symptomatology from therapeutics. 
* Hua Tuo: A great multidisciplinary surgeon who is credited with the techniques of narcosis (Ma Jue Fa) and abdominal openings (Kai Fu Shu), as well as suture. He also focused on obstetrics, hydrotherapy, and gymnastic exercises (Wu Qin Xi). 
* Huang Fumi: Author of Zhen Jiu Yi Jing, a classic on acupuncture. 
* Wang Shu He: Author of Mai Jing, a classic on taking the pulse.
* Ge Hong: alchemist, Taoist and phytotherapist who developed longevity methods based on respiratory, dietary and pharmacological exercises. 
* Tao Hongjing: expert in pharmacological remedies. 


## Greek medicine 

The classic term coined by the Greeks to define medicine, tekhne iatriké (the technique or art of healing), or those used to name the “doctor of diseases” (_ietèr kakôn_) and the surgeon (worker of the hands or _kheirourgein_) synthesize this concept of medicine as a science. Man begins to dominate nature and allows himself (even through his own myths) to challenge the gods (Anchises, Peleus, Lycaon or Ulysses himself).

The oldest written Greek work that includes knowledge about medicine are the Homeric poems: The Iliad and The Odyssey. The first describes, for example, how Fereclo is speared by Meriones in the buttock, “near the bladder and under the pubic bone”, or the treatment King Menelaus receives after being hit by an arrow in the wrist during the siege of Troy, where the surgeon turns out to be Asclepius, the god of Greek medicine, educated in medical science by the centaur Chiron. Aesculapius, an ancient synonym for doctor, derives from his name, and the name of Hygea, his daughter, served as inspiration for the current branch of preventive medicine called Hygiene. Asclepius is also credited with the origin of the Rod of Asclepius, a universal medical symbol today.

In the 6th century BC, Alcmaeon of Crotona, a Pythagorean philosopher dedicated to medicine, developed a theory of health that began to leave behind the pre-technical healing rituals that had laid the foundations of Greek medicine until then: the prayer (_eukhé_) to the gods of health (Asclepius, Artemis, Apollo, Pallas Athena, Hygea,...); the dances or healing rites (Dionysus), or the empirical knowledge of basic remedies. Alcmaeon authored the first known work on anatomy, founded the first known school of medicine in Ancient Greece, at Cnidus, and also established the practice of patient observation. In Crotona, Cos or Cnido medical schools began to flourish following the concept of Alcmaeon, based on natural science, or physiology.

But the quintessential medical figure of classical Greek culture is Hippocrates. It is known about this doctor, thanks to the biography written by Sorano of Ephesus about 500 years after his death, that he was born in Cos around the year 460 BC. C. and his life coincides with the golden age of Hellenic civilization and its new worldview of reason against myth. Galen and later the Alexandrian school considered him “the perfect doctor”, for which he has been classically hailed as the father of modern medicine. In reality, the work attributed to Hippocrates is a compilation of some fifty treatises (Corpus Hippocraticum) produced over several centuries (most of it between the 5th and 4th centuries BC), so it is more appropriate to speak of a “Hippocratic school”, founded on the principles of the so-called Hippocratic Oath.

Hippocrates was the first to claim that diseases were caused by natural elements. The existence of the Hippocratic Oath implies that this “Hippocratic medicine” was practiced by a group of medical professionals linked, at least among themselves, by a strict code of ethics. Aspiring medical students, who normally paid a fee for their training, entered into a virtually familiar relationship with their teacher. This training included some oral instruction and probably experience as a teaching assistant, since the oath assumes that the student had some interaction with patients. The Oath also places limits on what the physician may or may not do and suggests the existence of another class of specialist professionals, perhaps similar to surgeons.

One of the characteristics of Hippocratic medicine is the theory of the four humours, which is related to the theory of the four elements (proposed by Empedocles). Also, Hippocrates and some contemporaries agreed that diseases were found in the blood, so the practice of extracting a little blood from the arms of patients began, but in most cases different herbs were prescribed, some examples They are: 

The balance between the four humors is equal to health, according to Hippocrates. 

* Euphrasia: was used for optical diseases. 
* Hyssop: Hippocrates prescribed it for coughs, bronchitis and other infections. 
* Candelaria: it was used to combat cough (it is still used today).
* Motherwort: It was thought that it relieved heart disease and the pain of childbirth. 
* Smooth cerraja: supposedly relieved stomach discomfort and scorpion stings. 

Many of the substances used by the ancient Egyptians in their pharmacopoeia were exported to Greece and their influence increased after the establishment of a Greek medical school in Alexandria. 

Also in Greece, the first operations arose, which were rare and were performed without anesthesia (and with simple instruments). They were very painful and almost all patients died from infection or shock.

Despite all the advances in medicine and the practice of sports in gyms, the average lifespan was very low; men lived, in general, up to 44 years and women up to 35. 

The following two centuries (4th and 3rd BC) saw the takeoff of the Greek philosophical movements. Aristotle learned medicine from his father but there is no record of an assiduous exercise of this discipline. On the other hand, his peripatetic school was the cradle of several important doctors of the time: Diocles of Caristo, Praxagoras of Cos or Theophrastus of Ereso, among others.

Around the year 300 BC, Alexander the Great founded Alexandria, the city that in a short time would become the cultural benchmark of the Mediterranean and the Near East. The Alexandrian school compiled and developed all the knowledge about medicine (like many other disciplines) known at the time, helping to train some outstanding doctors. Some sources point to the possibility that the Ptolemies put prisoners sentenced to death at their disposal to practice vivisections.

One of the most notable physicians of the Alexandrian school was Erasistratus of Ceos, discoverer of the common bile duct (duct that empties bile into the small intestine), and the portal circulation system (a venous system that crosses the liver with blood from the tract). digestive). Herophilus of Chalcedon was another of the great physicians of this school: he correctly described the structures called the meninges, the choroid plexuses and the fourth cerebral ventricle.

At the same time, the empiricist school developed, whose main medical exponent was Glauco de Tarentio (1st century BC). Glauco could be considered as the forerunner of evidence-based medicine, since for him there was only one reliable basis: the results based on his own experience, on that of other doctors or on logical analogy, when there were no previous data to compare. 

After the incorporation of Egypt as a Roman province (30 BC), the Alexandrian period ends and the golden age of Roman medicine begins. 

## Medicine in Rome

Medicine in Ancient Rome was an extension of Greek medical knowledge. The Etruscan civilization, before importing the knowledge of the Greek culture, had hardly developed a medical corpus of interest, except for a remarkable skill in the field of dentistry. 

But the growing importance of the metropolis during the first periods of expansion attracted important Greek and Alexandrian medical figures who ended up forming in Rome the main center of medical, clinical and educational knowledge in the Mediterranean area.

The most important medical figures of Ancient Rome were Asclepiades of Bithynia (124 or 129 BC – 40 BC), Aulus Cornelius Celsus (25 BC – 50 AD), Pedanius Dioscorides Anazarbeus (40 AD – 90 AD) and Galen of Pergamon (129 or 130 AD - 200 or 216 AD). The first, openly opposed to the Hippocratic theory of humours, developed a new school of medical thought, the Methodical School, based on the works of Democritus, and which explains disease through the influence of atoms passing through the pores of the body. body, in a foretaste of germ theory. Some physicians attached to this school were Temison of Laodicea, Thessalo of Trales or Sorano of Ephesus, the editor of the first known biography of Hippocrates.

Between the years 25 BC and 50 AD lived another important medical figure: Aulus Cornelius Celsus. In reality, there is no evidence that he practiced medicine, but a medical treatise (De Re Medica Libri Octo) is preserved, included in a larger work, of an encyclopedic nature, called De artibus (On the arts). This medical treatise includes the clinical definition of inflammation that has lasted to this day: “Heat, pain, tumor and redness.”

With the beginning of the Christian era another medical school developed in Rome: the Pneumatic School. If the Hippocratics referred to the liquid humors as the cause of the disease and the atomists emphasized the influence of solid particles called atoms, the pneumatics would see in the pneuma (gas) that enters the organism through the lungs, the cause. of the pathological disorders suffered by the human being. Followers of this current of thought were Athenaeus of Atalia or Aretheus of Cappadocia.

In Rome, the medical caste was already organized (in a way reminiscent of the current division by specialties) into general practitioners (_medici_), surgeons (_medici vulnerum_, _chirurgi_), oculists (_medici ab oculis_), dentists, and specialists in diseases of the ear. There was no official regulation to be considered a doctor, but based on the privileges granted to doctors by Julius Caesar, a maximum quota per city was established. On the other hand, the Roman legions had a field surgeon and a team capable of installing a hospital (_valetudinaria_) in the middle of the battlefield to attend to those wounded during combat. One of these legionary doctors, enlisted in Nero's armies, was Pedanius Dioscórides of Anazarba (Cilicia), the author of the most widely used and well-known pharmacological manual until the fifteenth century. His travels with the Roman army allowed him to collect a large sample of herbs (about six hundred) and medicinal substances to write his great work: De Materia Medica (Hylikà, popularly known as “the Dioscórides”). The text describes some 600 medicinal plants, including the mandrake, some 90 minerals, and about 30 substances of animal origin.

But the quintessential Roman medical figure was Claudius Galen, whose influence (and anatomical and physiological errors) lasted until the 16th century (the first to correct him was Vesalius). Galen of Pergamon was born in the year 130 of our era, under Greek influence and under the protection of one of the largest temples dedicated to Aesculapius (Asclepius). He studied medicine with two followers of Hippocrates, Straconius and Satyrus, and still later visited the medical schools of Smyrna, Corinth, and Alexandria. He eventually traveled to Rome where his fame as a gladiatorial doctor led him to be chosen physician to the emperor (Marcus Aurelius). However, in Rome autopsies were prohibited, so his knowledge of anatomy was based on animal dissections, which led him to make some mistakes. But he also made notable contributions: he corrected the error of Erasistratus, who believed that arteries carried air, and is considered one of the first experimentalists in medicine: «Short and clever is the path of speculation, but it leads nowhere; long and arduous is the path of the experiment, but it leads us to know the truth».

He was the main exponent of the Hippocratic school, but his work is a synthesis of all the medical knowledge of the time. His treatises were copied, translated, and studied for the next thirteen centuries, for which he is considered one of the most important and influential physicians in Western medicine. His main work, _Methodo medendi_ (On the art of healing), exerted enormous importance in medicine for fifteen centuries.

Aretaeus of Cappadocia did not obtain the fame and public recognition of Galen, but the little written material that has survived from him shows a great knowledge and an even greater common sense. Not much information is known about this modest Roman doctor, except that he came from the current Turkish province of Cappadocia and that he lived during the first century after Christ. He must have trained in Alexandria (where autopsies were allowed) since his knowledge of visceral anatomy is very complete. He is the first doctor to describe the clinical picture of tetanus, and the current names of epilepsy or diabetes are due to him.

It is necessary to highlight a capital contribution of Roman public medicine. Among the main Roman architects (Columella, Marco Vitruvio or Marco Vipsanio Agrippa) there was the conviction that malaria was spread through insects or marshy waters. Under this principle, they undertook public works such as aqueducts, sewers and public toilets aimed at ensuring a supply of quality drinking water and an adequate excreta evacuation system. Modern medicine will agree with them almost twenty centuries later, when it is shown that the drinking water supply and the sewage disposal system are two of the main indicators of the level of health of a population.

# Leprosy in the time of Jesus 

## Introduction 

Leprosy is a well-known pathology since ancient times, stigmatizing, mutilating, socially marginalizing, chronic, with a most florid and variable expression, terrible for the patient, marker of their way of life and their destiny. Its slow evolution made this condition an ordeal, whose ancient therapy was based on combating its symptomatic states, as a result of the limited knowledge of the time.

The term “leprosy” comes from the Greek and means “scaly”. The Greek word used by Hippocrates and the doctors of Hellas called leprosy to lesions that appeared on the skin with a scaly appearance, what we know today by the name of psoriasis. They also called this type of lesion “psoriasis léuki”, which means white leprosy.

The problem apparently arises because of the translations of the Bible, on the one hand, and the Arabic versions of the Greek works on the other. Thus the Hebrew term «_tsara'ath_», with which the whitish lesions of the skin were designated, is translated by the Greek word leprosy. With the word tsara'ath it has happened as with many other biblical terms that designate illnesses, that by not being able to identify them, they have created insoluble translation problems. _Tsara'ath_ is the word that was applied generically to all skin diseases.

Maimonides already interpreted it this way in his «_Tumat ha-tsara´ath_», where he interprets this word as dermatitis or dermatosis. Thus, a distinction is made between _néga ha-tsara´ath_ (primary syphilis, raspberry), _tsara´ath or basar_ (ulcus durum), _tsara´ath puráht_ (secondary syphilis), _tsara´ath noshénet_ (tertiary syphilis, raspberry), _tsara´ ath ha-rosh_ (trichoficia or tsara´ath of the head), _tsara´ath ha-báyit_ (saprofites, dirt, contamination). 

Although _tsara'ath_ is often interpreted as leprosy, only _tsara'ath ha-metsah_ is leonine leprosy. The fact that _tsara'ath_ was cured in days or weeks indicates that it was not always leprosy.

A distinction is also made in the biblical texts between _tsarúa_ (luetic or bejel, frambesia or pinta) and _metsorá_ (leper). The Greeks knew the true leprosy and described it with the name of elephantiasis, due to the facial deformation produced by this disease, whose nodules or lepromas, as they grew and merged, resembled the appearance of the elephant's skin. 

Then, when the Arabs begin to make translations of the Greek authors, the second confusion arises when interpreting the word elephantiasis by “Dal-Fil” which means “elephant's foot”. Hence, different terms have emerged in the history of medicine to designate the true Hansen's disease: elephantiasis graecorum and elephantiasis arabum.

The Hebrews used the word _juzam_ to describe modern Greek elephantiasis or leprosy and _juzam_ will be translated into Latin by the Greek word leprosy, the same word used by the ancient Greeks to designate a number of different skin lesions. 

Lucretius and Celsus will distinguish between elephantiasis graecorum or elephantiasis of the Greeks and leprosy graecorum, or psoriasis and related diseases. Little by little, the resounding name of leprosy was replacing the no less resounding, but longer name of elephantiasis graecorum, and today it has a naturalization certificate. 

## Antiquity of leprosy 

Studying the ancient texts of the various cultures of the East, it has been possible to observe and write down descriptions of this disease in documents as old as the Brugsch Papyrus (2,400 BC).

For their part, the works of Susruta, in India (Susruta Samhita), and Charaka, two of the most famous Hindu doctors (500-100 BC), already mention an infectious disease, one of whose varieties produced the "loss of the sense of touch”, a clear allusion to anesthetic leprosy. 

In China it is mentioned in several Pen-tsaos and in the Annals of Confucius (600 BC). The Old Testament (Pentateuch, Leviticus) establishes the concept of leper.

Taking into account the antiquity of each one of the documentary testimonies, a first impression seems to show that from very remote times it was known in Egypt and the East (Mesopotamia and India), later it appears on the one hand in China and Japan and in the West in Greece. , the Italian Peninsula and North Africa, and already in the Middle Ages it will spread throughout Europe. But let us specify this first impression in more detail.

The Vedas of India collect very old ideas and oral traditions that date back to 6,000 BC Already in the Vedas the idea of ​​leprosy can be observed, the idea of ​​the existence of this disease in Asia in very remote times. Hindu medicine learned about true leprosy and its medical care with methods that we can describe as “modern”, this at a time when there was still no news of it in Greece, or at least there is no documentary evidence, since there are no sources written with that antiquity in Europe. In the Atarva-Veda and the Manava Darma Castra, the symptoms of true leprosy (1500 – 500 BC) are described, recommending various prophylactic measures against this disease. In the Susruta Samhita (600 – 100 BC) leprosy is cited under the name of Vat-Rakta, Vat-Shomita and Kushta, Chaulmoogra oil is recommended for its cure. In India, the word _kushta_ was known since that great antiquity, which encompasses a large number of skin diseases, among which Hansen's disease predominates.

In China, a term existed since ancient times, _li_ or _lai_, which also encompassed very varied skin lesions from psoriasis to prurigo and eczema, and possibly leprosy. Also in Sanskrit there is the word kilasa with which leukoderma is designated. In old Chinese texts such as Shan-Han-Lun and Kun-Yin-Chen-Sien-Chuan, a disease is described that covers the body with ulcers that look and smell disgusting. No fewer than 15 Chinese words have been identified to designate skin lesions consistent with leprosy. The most apparently significant are the aforementioned terms _li_ and _lieh_, _lieh-fang_ and _wu-chi_, which are still used to designate leprosy. In Chinese texts, in addition to descriptions of leprosy, leprosy is treated with purgatives, diaphoretics and arsenic. It is said that one of Confucius' disciples named Pe-Nieu died of leprosy. The Chu dynasty chronicle contains a detailed description of true leprosy. Hua-To, the famous Chinese doctor-surgeon who was beheaded by one of the Chinese emperors, who thought he wanted to kill him by recommending a cranial trepanation for his cure, in the year 190 BC, in his work “Complete Secret Remedies”, makes a detailed description of leprosy and its forms, details the nodular lesions, hoarseness, anesthesia and the contagiousness of the disease, as well as the influence of lack of hygiene, dirt, overcrowding, promiscuity and prolonged contact.

Among Malays and Indonesians, the word for leprosy is _kusta_. It is interesting to note that this word is not of Malay origin, but rather a Hindu cultural loanword. With the Hindu invasion and Hinduism, leprosy also entered these islands, which was given the name that they did not have, that of _kusta_, which is the softened form of _kushta_. 

In Japan its antiquity is several centuries and the oldest documentary sources already designate it with the name of _tsumí_. 

In Angkor (Cambodia) bas-reliefs have been found in the ruins of some of the temples that represent obvious mutilating and disfiguring lesions of leprosy.

In Mesopotamia, among Assyrians, Babylonians, Akkadians, Elamites and Sumerians, the word _saharsubbu_ and _isurbaa_ was used to mean “body covered with scabs”, plagued and also covered with dust, but the word eqpu was also known to designate a disease that destroyed face and body, it contaminated the patient and made him impure and horrible in the sight of others, and it was leprosy, the worst punishment that the gods could send to man. The word bennu in Mesopotamia was also used to designate leprosy.

Already Herodotus, the great historian and traveler, had observed during his travels through Persia, that certain people who suffered from this disease, which filled them with pustules and gave them a bad appearance, were isolated outside the cities. They were probably lepers at times and other times sick with dermatoses or dermatopathies in general or various skin infections. Herodotus, writing 170 years before Jesus Christ, considers India as the place where leprosy comes from. Before him, Ctesias, who was also a great Greek traveler (5th century BC), supports this same theory.

In Egypt, the Ebers papyrus (1300-1000 BC), in addition to the aforementioned Brugsch papyrus, which collects very ancient knowledge of Egypt, describes leprosy in its tuberculoid and lepromatous forms, with the names of Chous tumors and _Chous_ mutilations. Egypt has always been regarded as the place from which the disease reached the Western world. Ancient writings attribute the infection to the waters of the Nile (Lucretius, _De Nat. Rer._, VI, 1112) and to the unhealthy diet of the people (Galen). Various causes helped spread the disease beyond Egypt. First among the causes, Manetho puts the Hebrews, who according to him, were a mass of lepers, of which the Egyptians got rid of them from their territory. Although it is a legend, there is no doubt that at the time of the exodus, the contamination had affected the Hebrews.

The Phoenician sailors brought leprosy to Syria and the countries with which they had commercial relations; hence the name “Phoenician disease” given by Hippocrates, arising from the fact that traces were found along the west coast of Greece around the 18th century BC and in Persia around the 5th century BC. The dispersion of the Jews after the restoration (5th century BC) and the campaigns of the Roman army are believed to be responsible for the spread of the disease in the Roman world: the Roman colonies in Spain, Gaul and Brittany were quickly destroyed. infected. 

## The disease-sin 

From an anthropological point of view, the origin of the disease, of diseases in general, is attributed by various cultures to various causes: 

1. Offense to the divinity.
2. Offends the ancestors in a certain way deified. 
3. Sorcery or evil arts of a person with powers for it. 
4. Violation of a taboo or cultural prohibition. 
5. Penetration of a foreign body, visible or invisible. 
6. Rapture of the soul. 
7. Supernatural causes in general. 
8. Natural causes. 

In Ayurveda, 18 varieties of leprosy are described, considering that one is of venereal origin, another for being cruel to animals, another produced for having offended parents, ancestors or divinities, due to bites from poisonous animals, by greed, gluttony or frequent ingestion of food.

Whether it is the transgression of a law or taboo, or an offense against the divinity, the guilty party remains stained, impure, contaminated. 

This concept has been considered oriental, and to say oriental is something very vague, especially after having observed, studying ethnic groups in America, Africa, Oceania and Asia, that all those we call primitives have this idea as a common element among their traditions. more entrenched. 

Among the Shintoists of Japan, sin stains the soul and the body. If a skin disease appears, and especially _tsumi_ or leprosy, the impurity due to sin accompanies the sick person for the duration of the disease. 

The same attitude is manifested in Tibet, Nepal, Indochina, Burma, Siam and Korea: everyone who has a disgusting skin disease is because he has sinned.

Sickness-sin, sickness-blame, sickness-stain, which requires purification, purging, cleansing, is an archaic concept, one of the most archaic in humanity. Probably the oldest study and knowledge of the customs of the East has meant that in ancient European literature this idea has been attributed to the East, but after knowing what we call “primitives” on all continents, we can assure you that this idea is present in humanity from a prehistoric and preliterate stage. Therefore, the Hebrew tradition could not be alien to this concept of disease-impurity or disease-punishment of God.

The study of this tradition, contained in the Old Testament, and its diffusion not only among the Hebrew people, but later in the derived religions, Christianity and Islam, makes this idea of ​​the disease-punishment of God manifest with all its force. .

In the 20th century BC, the Hebrews left Ur, in Chaldea, to cross the Middle East for almost three centuries. Surely they carry with them leprosy and the idea of ​​disease-sin, disease impurity-punishment. The oldest books of the Israelites prove it. After their captivity in Egypt, the exodus takes place, and Leviticus appears, another of their law books, written by Moses, in which he codifies and gathers all the preventive, curative, and religious medical knowledge they had acquired in Egypt. The dirt to which the Hebrews were forced, due to lack of water when crossing desert areas, must have been the cause of multiple and frequent skin diseases, and this was the reason that Moses dedicated such an extensive chapter to skin conditions that he grouped under the common denominator of _zara´ath_ or _tsara´ath_. He mentions the leprosy of man, that of clothes and that of dwellings, and relates all of them to sin (Lv 13:2-7,9-17,25). Leprosy must be diagnosed by the priest who declares the sufferer impure (Lv 13:28,47-59,35-36).

The religious meaning of leprosy will continue to exist in the West based on biblical knowledge and propagated by the Levitical concept of impurity. From the Old Testament it will pass to the New, in which the idea that leprosy is purified continues, although Jesus heals lepers (Lk 5:12-16), separating for the first time the concepts of healing of the body and spiritual health by faith. Thus this concept of religious illness will continue in Christianity for many centuries. 

## Early Greco-Roman descriptions

The word leprosy, which, as was said, is Greek, is already found in the _Corpus Hippocraticum_ (_Aphorisms_, III, 20; _De Usu humidorum_ and _Epidemias_, 21), but associated with psoriasis, eczema and other skin diseases. The true leprosy, which is already known to the Greeks, is described, as already stated, by the name of elephantiasis.

In the time of Emperor Augustus, Celsus makes a detailed clinical description of true leprosy or “elephantiasis graecorum” (III, 251). Celso says thus: «A disease almost unknown in Italy, but very widespread in certain countries, is what the Greeks call elephantiasis, which is cited among chronic affections. It affects the entire physical constitution of the patient, to the point that even the bones are altered. The surface of the body is strewn with numerous spots and tumors, the red color of which gradually acquires a blackish hue. The skin becomes uneven, oily, thin, hard, soft and scaly; the body becomes thinner, the face swells, as do the legs and feet. When the disease has acquired a certain duration, the fingers and toes disappear in a way under this swelling.

Another description is that made by Aretaeus of Cappadocia of the disease he calls leontiasis, which are the lesions of true leprosy on the face that, in addition to adopting an appearance similar to the face of a lion, suffers destruction of the bones. He also calls it satyriasis, due to the parchment-like skin and sexual appetite observed in patients. 

Pliny, in his _Historia Natural_ (XXVI, 51), points out that elephantiasis was a new disease in Italy, imported from Egypt in the time of Pompey the Great (10-48 BC). 

Galen does not talk much about leprosy. As Mettler will say in his At that time, the confusion between elephantiasis and lichen of the Greeks began. 

## Etiology

Historically, we must mention the already mentioned belief of illness as a punishment from the gods for an offense or transgression of the law. 

Serapion considers that leprosy is due to disorders of the liver and also that it can be acquired through sexual transmission (this makes us suspect that there was confusion between leprosy and syphilitic lesions). 

Medieval doctors in Europe will think that the cause of leprosy is fish and milk. Engelbreth believed that the cause was goat's milk, in the idea that leprosy was a variety of goat tuberculosis. 

It was not until the 19th century that a special individual susceptibility was thought of, and Hansen's bacillus, directly responsible for the disease, was discovered. 

## Leprosy in the Bible

Apart from the legislation on leprosy contained in Leviticus, already cited, and in the Pentateuch, it is also said that “Many lepers were in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet” (Lk 4:27). 

For the diagnosis of leprosy, Leviticus gives certain rules to the priests. “When one has a scaly or white spot on his body, if the hairs have turned white and the affected part is sunken deeper than the rest of the skin, it is plague of leprosy”, and therefore the patient is considered impure and for this circumstance he had to live separately from the others, outside the camp.

One of the most notable quotes from the Bible in relation to leprosy is that of Moses (Ex 4 61). Yahweh said to Moses: Put your hand back into your bosom. And he put his hand back in his bosom; and when he drew it out, behold, his hand was leprous as snow." And he said, “Put your hand back in your bosom. And he put his hand back in his bosom; and when he took it out again from the womb, behold, it had become like other meat.”

The Holy Scriptures, in Lv 13:1-9, 44-46 define the double character of leprosy that includes that which spreads through the skin covering it in its entirety, from head to toe, and speaks of the most innocent leprosy for having become all of her in the same, being then that man declared clean. On the contrary, if flesh was allowed to be seen on him, he would be declared unclean by the priest, because anyone smeared with leprosy was considered unclean. "Yahweh spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying: When one has a scaly spot on his flesh, or a group of them, or a bright white spot and the plague of leprosy is thus represented on the skin of his flesh, he will be taken away. to Aaron, priest or to one of his priest sons. The priest will examine the skin of the flesh and if he sees that the hairs have turned white and that the affected part is sunken deeper than the rest of the skin, it is the plague of leprosy and the priest who has examined him will declare him impure. .» On the other hand, the Bible tells us that if the spot found was white and the skin did not sink in or the hair changed color, the patient would only be confined for seven days, examining him again after this period in order to verify that the evil did not spread. If so, he would be confined for another seven days, until a second examination by the priest, declaring him clean if the characteristics of the injury did not extend during that period. On the contrary, if it had spread, the patient would be declared impure, since that, without a doubt, was leprosy. it is the plague of leprosy and the priest who has examined him will pronounce him unclean.” On the other hand, the Bible tells us that if the spot found was white and the skin did not sink in or the hair changed color, the patient would only be confined for seven days, examining him again after this period in order to verify that the evil did not spread. If so, he would be confined for another seven days, until a second examination by the priest, declaring him clean if the characteristics of the injury did not extend during that period. On the contrary, if it had spread, the patient would be declared impure, since that, without a doubt, was leprosy. it is the plague of leprosy and the priest who has examined him will pronounce him unclean.” On the other hand, the Bible tells us that if the spot found was white and the skin did not sink in or the hair changed color, the patient would only be confined for seven days, examining him again after this period in order to verify that the evil did not spread. If so, he would be confined for another seven days, until a second examination by the priest, declaring him clean if the characteristics of the injury did not extend during that period. On the contrary, if it had spread, the patient would be declared impure, since that, without a doubt, was leprosy. The patient would only be confined for seven days, examining him again at the end of this period in order to verify that the disease had not spread. If so, he would be confined for another seven days, until a second examination by the priest, declaring him clean if the characteristics of the injury did not extend during that period. On the contrary, if it had spread, the patient would be declared impure, since that, without a doubt, was leprosy. The patient would only be confined for seven days, examining him again at the end of this period in order to verify that the disease had not spread. If so, he would be confined for another seven days, until a second examination by the priest, declaring him clean if the characteristics of the injury did not extend during that period. On the contrary, if it had spread, the patient would be declared impure, since that, without a doubt, was leprosy.

The fact of presenting a scaly disease that completely covered the patient from head to toe and made him look white, would make the patient considered pure since white has been the color of purity since time immemorial. On the other hand, the areas of living flesh were interpreted as impure and those who suffered from them had to live outside the camp.

The Bible tells us about Mary, Aaron's wife (Numbers 12:9), who, speaking with her husband, had murmured about Moses. “The anger of Yahweh was kindled against them and the cloud departed from the Tabernacle and, behold, Mary was leprous as snow; and Aaron looked at Miriam and, behold, she was leprous, and Aaron said to Moses: Ah, my Lord, do not lay this sin on us now; because we have acted madly and we have sinned. Let her not be left now like the one who is born dead, who when leaving her mother's womb has already half consumed her flesh ». Moses asks Yahweh to heal her and Yahweh replies that she must first remain outside the camp for seven days, after which she will return to the congregation. At the end of that time, Mary rejoins them, but she doesn't tell us from the Bible whether she came back healed or not.

Another case of biblical leprosy is that of Naaman the Syrian (2 Kings 5:1-7), «General of the army of the king of Syria, who was a great man before his master, and held him in high esteem, because through he had given Yahweh salvation to Syria. He was this extremely brave man, but leper ». An Israelite girl, who was being held captive as his wife's servant, advised him to call the prophet of Samaria and then “he would heal him of leprosy.” When Naaman found out, he told his mistress, who gave him permission to go to Israel and be healed, sending letters to the king of the Israelites and giving Naaman money and provisions for the trip. In the letter he said: “I am sending my servant Naaman to you so that you may heal him of his leprosy.” In Israel, Elisha, the prophet, commands him to wash seven times.s in the Jordan, “And your flesh will be restored to you, and you will be clean.” This did not please Naaman, who hoped that the touch of the prophet's hand would immediately heal his illness. Despite his displeasure he obeyed the prophet, “and his flesh became like the flesh of a child and he was cleansed.” When he introduces himself to Elisha, he sets as a final condition that he will only worship Yahweh, the God of Israel. In the same biblical episode, Gehazi, Elijah's servant, seeing that Elijah did not want to charge him anything for the cure, aroused his greed, through a ruse, gets Naaman to give him two silver talents and two new clothes. But Elijah discovered his deception and punished him, saying, “Naaman's leprosy will stick to you and your offspring forever. And he came out from before him a leper, white as snow."

This paragraph makes a clear allusion to the contagiousness of leprosy and heritability, although it is not true leprosy, which is always doubtful in these biblical passages in which it is said that the skin turns white, which suggests psoriasis. for example. 

We also read the case of King Azarias (2 Kgs 15:51), whom “Yahweh smote with leprosy, and he was leprous to the day of his death and dwelt in a separate house, and Jotham the king's son was in charge of the palace.” ruling the people.

King Uzziah or Uzziah (1 Chr 26:21-23) “was a leper until the day of his death, and he dwelt as a leper in a secluded house, for which he was excluded from the house of Yahweh.” This Uzziah or Ozias, with a different name, is the same Azariah from 2 Kings, who when he felt powerful «rebeled against Yahweh». Azariah is called the priest of the temple who criticizes the king for having burned incense in the temple, something that corresponded to the priests. King Uzziah was furious “and in his anger against the priests, leprosy broke out on his forehead before the priests in the house of Yahweh, by the altar of incense.” They made him leave the temple and he "hastened to leave also, because Yahweh had struck him. Thus King Uzziah was a leper until the day of his death and lived as a leper in a secluded house, for which he was excluded from the house of Yahweh; and Jotham his son,

There are also four unnamed men with leprosy (2 Kings 7:3) at the gate of Samaria. There comes a time when they seem to get tired of living excluded, outside the city, and they say to each other: “Why are we here until we die? If we tried to enter the city, because of the hunger that exists in it, we would also die; and if we stay here, we will also die.” They decide to go to the Syrian camp, where they prefer to risk being killed, given the possibility of finding food.

Job's illness could have been leprosy, but this word does not appear in the editions translated from the Hebrew. However, when Satan tells Yahweh to punish him in his own body and “touch his bone and his flesh to test his faith,” Yahweh gives Satan permission to test him. He and he struck Job “with a malignant itch from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head,” which must have made him very itchy, for Job even picked up a pot to scratch himself. “I walk blackened and not because of the sun,” Job will say, speaking of his illness, and he repeats “my skin has turned black and is falling off, and my bones are burning with heat.”

In the New Testament, Jesus heals a leper (Mt 8:1-41: “And behold, a leper came and prostrated himself before him, saying, Lord, if you are willing, you can make me clean. Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying: I want to; be clean “. And immediately his leprosy disappeared. Then Jesus said to him: ”Look, tell no one, but go, show yourself to the priest and present the offering that Moses commanded, as a testimony to them “. Mark (Mk 1 40-45) and Luke (Lk 5 12-16) tell us In Matthew (Mt 11 51) it is said that ”lepers are cleansed by Jesus “. Finally, another character related to our topic is Simon ”the leper “ (Mt 26 6), since it says ”when Jesus was in the house of Simon the leper", in Bethany. Presumably, if he was a leper, he was cured, otherwise he could not have remained in his house, according to the law.

## Leprosy and its names 

Apart from the already mentioned elephantiasis of Greeks and Arabs, that of tsara'ath in Hebrew, leprosy was called “Saint Lazarus disease” or “Saint Lazarus disease” by Lazarus the beggar , who in the evangelical parable, covered with ulcers, had to dispute the leftovers from the rich man's table with the dogs (Lk 16:19-31).

But another remarkable fact in the history of diseases is that this beggar Lazarus is identified, it is not known when or how, with another evangelical Lazarus, the Lazarus of Bethany, the friend of Jesus, brother of Martha and Mary, whom Jesus resurrects in another Gospel passage (Jn 11:1-44). Hence, some leper hospital in England such as Sherburn, which was very famous, was called “Hospital of Saint Lazarus and his sisters Mary and Martha”, and in other places in England, the name of Saint Lazarus disappears to remain only that of Martha and Mary, under whose patronage most of the lepers and leper hospitals of medieval England are placed. Then María is identified with María Magdalena and the name of Marta disappears and thus the hospitals of “La Magdalena” and “Mawedelyn” or “Maudlin” arise. which in France will be “La Madeleine”. For example, St. Mary Magdalene's leper hospital in Totnes in Devon.

In many other places Saint George emerges as a defender of lepers, because of the spear and the dragon he destroys. It was seen in this allegorical scene the living representation of what was wanted to be done with leprosy, of the fight against leprosy. It will be in the Nordic countries of Europe where leper hospitals are placed under the patronage of Saint George and he is taken as the patron saint of lepers. 

In Spain, patients with the evil of San Lázaro are called lazrados, and also malatos, hence lacería and malatería, names applied to leper hospitals or lazarettos.

_Gafo_ has been another word widely used to designate lepers and gafedad to leprosy, by the gafa hand or in forced flexion of the fingers on the palm, although not only this type of injury occurs in leprosy but in other pathological processes. such as chronic deforming rheumatism.

The voice _gafo_ and its derivative _gafe_, was used as a derogatory term and equivalent to a person who brings bad luck. Being _jinxed_ is like being a _jetattore_ or being a badass. Perhaps derived or related to this is the word _cahot_ or _cagot_ or _cacot_ used in France and the Spanish Pyrenees to designate lepers and by extension an ethnic group, the _agotes_ or _agotak_, a marginalized group, considered a cursed race for a long time that It lives in the deep valleys of the Pyrenees. They were also called christiaas, cailluands, colliberts, and caeths. 

Lai in China, _tsumi_ in Japan, isurbaa and _eqpu_ in Mesopotamia, _kushta_ in India, Kusta among Malays and Indonesians and Filipinos, _likprar_ in Iceland, _mai-pake_ (Chinese disease) in Hawaii.

In Portugal, leprosy has been called alvaraz, elefancia dos arabes, mal de San Lázaro, dry gangrene, Pida, figado, gafa, gafeira, gafem, guafem and gafidade. Those affected by this disease were called elephants, lepers, gafos, lazaros, lazarinos and handles. 

## Treatment 

We know that both in Asia and among the Hebrews themselves, the appearance of a case of leprosy was immediately followed by the decree of separation and expulsion of the patient outside the limits of the town, camp or city. 

In the East they underwent treatment with various products, from mercury to _chaulmoogra_ oil (China, India).

The separation of lepers from healthy people was used as a means of prophylaxis or so that the impurity of the affected person (punished by the gods) did not reach the healthy. People suspected of suffering from leprosy were reported to the city authorities, which through a jury, sometimes municipal in the medieval city. or the same priests in biblical times, had to diagnose the condition, the veracity of the complaint and act accordingly. The jury was ecclesiastical in many regions of Europe, in other places the diagnosis of a doctor who had to issue a certificate to the alleged patient was requested.

From the ancient practices and measures of hygiene and prophylaxis due to isolation, the burning of houses where a leper would have lived, up to our days, there have been many and varied trials to treat and cure leprosy. 

In ancient China, acupuncture was used, as well as various mineral substances, including arsenic, to cure leprosy. In the 19th century, it was believed that snake broth, especially majá or boa from Cuba, was an excellent remedy for leprosy, as well as turtle broth.

In India, the oil of _chaulmoogra_, which apparently was already known to Rama with the name of _kalow_, was used successfully since ancient times, and with which, according to the Ramayana of Valmiki, he cured himself of the contracted leprosy that forced him to depart from humans and live in the middle of the woods. This _kalow_ of Rama has been identified with a plant of the Flacurtiaceae family, Taraktogenes kurzii. In Burma, extracts of Hydrocarpus wightiana were used. Both plants produce _chaulmoogra_ oil.

It seems strange that the species arrived in Europe and yet the chaulmoogra oil that had been known since ancient times did not arrive from the East. Only in the 19th century and thanks to the observation made by the English Mouat in 1854 others say that Roxburg had already observed it in 1814, who verified the curative effect of this treatment that the Hindus knew no less than two thousand years ago.

**RELIGION** 

# Jewish holidays

The course of the year of the Canaanite population of Palestine, governed by processes of nature and with festivities based on them, was transformed by Israel, in the post-exilic period, into the year of the temple and of God. This transformation was carried out on the basis of what Yahweh did with Israel, by choosing his Patriarchs, establishing the Alliance with him, freeing him from Egypt and giving him the law and the promised land. Its first expression is found in what is established in _Lv_ 23. The historical foundation of the belief in Yahweh is manifested in the modality of the year of the temple and of God. 

## The New Year's Eve 

In Hebrew: _Rosh Hashanah_

The Jewish New Year was celebrated in the fall, in the first month of the Jewish calendar, Tishri, on day one. It is not certain that it was associated during the pre-exilic period with the notion of an accession to the throne or a triumphal entry as Yahweh's king, so that it would have been a recognition of Yahweh's kingship. For Rabbinic Judaism, New Year's Day is a day of foresight and predetermination; that day the means of subsistence of man were fixed; what punishments were to be imposed on the world and what damages man was to suffer were established. In part, this could be consistent with the fact that the rabbis considered New Year's Day as the day of God's judgment that begins the great period of repentance, which lasts until the Great Day of Atonement and the Feast of Tabernacles. .

If there was a pre-exilic Israelite feast of the God-King on New Year's Day, it was associated in the post-exilic period with predominantly juridical notions. God judges on New Year's Day all who enter the world while confirming his sentence on the Great Day of Atonement. In three great books is kept the count and record of the completely just, who receive the sentence that leads them to life, as well as that of the unjust, who also receive their sentence, and that of those who are not even one. nor the other, who are granted ten days of repentance between New Year's Day and Pardon Day.

Thus, between New Year's Day and the Great Day of Atonement ten days later, there is an intervening period of repentance. According to a long comparison, God, the King of all kings, says to the Israelites: “Repent from the New Year. And they humbled themselves and came to the Day of Atonement and fasted on it and repented and God forgave them." With the Feast of Tabernacles, which begins five days after the day of Atonement, previous debts are forgiven, and with the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles a new account begins; the old one is settled in the heavenly books. This is why, according to rabbinic exegesis, the Jews wave the festival bouquet on the first day of the Feast of Tabernacles. And in this way a clear relationship is deduced between the New Year's party, the Day of Atonement and the Day of Tabernacles as Israel's great period of fasting and repentance. Perhaps these notions of repentance and judgment were given special intensity by the Hasidians.

_Rosh Hashanah_ (Beginning of the Year), together with _Yom Kippur_ (Day of Forgiveness), form in the Jewish tradition a unit called Yamim Noraim (Fearful Days) because it is the moment in which God judges the world and decrees what will happen in the course of of the new year. 

The traditional greeting on Rosh Hashanah is “_shaná tová_” (Hebrew for “Happy New Year”). 

It is customary to eat different foods during _Rosh Hashanah_ as symbols of wishes for the coming year. For example, apples with honey or sugar are eaten to symbolize a sweet year. 

This festivity is also characterized by blowing the _shofár_, a ram's horn. During the afternoon of the first day, the _tashlij_ is performed, the symbolic disposal of sins by going to a river or stream of water and reciting a prayer there. 

## The day of forgiveness

The _Yom Kippur_ or festival of forgiveness was a festival that was celebrated six days before the festival of tents, on the 10th day of the month tishri. It proceeded on it as on a great fast day, which is why it was also called without further ado “the great fast”. On the day of forgiveness it was forbidden to eat and drink, wash, anoint, wear sandals and cohabit. The exceptions were specified in rabbinical texts in great detail. The day of forgiveness was associated with the memory of the reception by Moses of the second tables of the law, after the sin of the golden calf; For this reason, the high priest should not wear gold garments, so as not to remind the accuser of the offense of the calf and prevent him from accusing Israel for it. The day of forgiveness was also considered as the circumcision of Abraham.

The fast began at sunset, and ended at sunset the next day. The _Yom Kippur_ prayer services began with the prayer known as _Kol Nidre_, which had to be recited before sunset. The _Kol Nidre_ (in Aramaic “all vows”) is a public abrogation of religious vows made by Jews during the preceding year. This only concerned unfulfilled vows made between a person and God, and did not nullify vows made between persons. A _talit_ (square prayer shawl) was worn at evening prayers, the only twilight service of the year in which this was done.

It was the great day of the high priest's service. Great precautions were taken so that he could officiate in a state of complete ritual purity. About the course of the day we have these data: «Seven days before the day of forgiveness the high priest was withdrawn from his house to the room of counselors». During these days he personally attended the service, celebrating daily the morning and evening sacrifices, called _tamîd_. On the evening of the eve of the great day of forgiveness, he was handed over by the oldest of the Sanhedrin to the oldest priests, who led him to a higher room in the residence of the Abtinas family, in the inner courtyard of the temple, a priestly family known for how well he knew how to prepare the incense. The great day of forgiveness itself began for the priest with the cult bath by immersion and with the washings, which were repeated several times throughout this day. Then he put on the white robes. Meanwhile, the calves and goats were prepared for the day's sacrifice. The first calf sacrificed was called the “high priest's calf.” He immolated himself in atonement for his sins and those of his family. The high priest approached him, laid his hands on him and meanwhile pronounced the confession of his sins: He immolated himself in atonement for his sins and those of his family. The high priest approached him, laid his hands on him and meanwhile pronounced the confession of his sins: He immolated himself in atonement for his sins and those of his family. The high priest approached him, laid his hands on him and meanwhile pronounced the confession of his sins:

> «Oh, Name!, I was indebted, I failed, I sinned before you, me and my house. Ay, oh Name!, give me atonement for the debts, errors and sins that I contracted, that I carried out and committed, before you, me and my house, as it is written in the law of Moses, your servant, in this way: because in this day will give expiations to you so that you may purify yourselves; You will be cleansed from all your sins before Yahweh.” 

The last Yahweh seems to have been pronounced by the priest in a low voice; Simultaneously, the priests intoned the praise: 

> «Blessed be the name of the majesty of your kingdom forever and ever».

Next, two male goats were raffled: one, the so-called scapegoat, for Yahweh; the other for Azazel. The first was slaughtered in the temple, the other was sent to the desert. Both had their heads surrounded by crimson ribbons and were placed, respectively, in the place where one would be slaughtered and where the other would be expelled. After the drawing and preparation of both goats, the second confession of sins was pronounced, in the same manner and form as the first, adding “and the sons of Aaron, your holy people”, in the places where it was said “I and my people.” The second confession therefore implores the forgiveness of the sins of all the priests. The calf was then slaughtered; the high priest collected his blood in a sprinkling pot and handed it to the priests. He, for his part, he took a brazier and penetrated with it into the sanctuary; at its threshold he would cast the incense sticks on the coal and penetrate with them into the temple, cross the sanctuary, pass through the curtains, to the Holy of Holies, and incense it until it was covered with smoke. Only the high priest was allowed to enter the Holy of Holies and he could only do so on the day of forgiveness. After a short prayer in the sanctuary, he went out again, took the blood of the slain calf, took it to the Holy of Holies and sprinkled the sacrificial blood seven times with his fingers on the place where the ark had been before the destruction of the temple by Nebuchadnezzar. , then returning through the sanctuary to the temple courtyard. Afterwards, the goat that had fallen to Yahweh was slaughtered there. his blood, likewise collected in a cup by the high priest, it was taken to the Holy of Holies and sprinkled there in the same way. At a third entrance into the Sancta Sanctorum, the remaining blood of the calf and goat was sprinkled on the curtains separating the Sancta Sanctorum from the sanctuary. Afterward, the golden altar of smoke offerings was purified of sins, also with the blood of the lamb and the goat; the rest was spilled on the ground, west of the altar of burnt offering, in the forecourt. with the blood also of the lamb and the goat; the rest was spilled on the ground, west of the altar of burnt offering, in the forecourt. with the blood also of the lamb and the goat; the rest was spilled on the ground, west of the altar of burnt offering, in the forecourt.

<em>The Scapegoat, by William Holamn Hunt, 1854. https://commons. wikimedia.org/wiki/File:William_Holman_Hunt_-_The_Scapegoat.jpg</em> 

Operations then began with the second he-goat, Azazel's goat. The high priest also laid his hands on him, pronouncing a third confession of guilt, this time in the name of the people. Having been cleansed of sin, both he and the priests officiated their services for the people. The confession said:

> «Oh Name!, your people, the house of Israel, fell into debt, erred and sinned before you. Ay, oh Name!, give expiation for the debts, the errors and sins that your people, the house of Israel, contracted, committed and carried out before you, as it is written in the Torah of Moses, your slave, in the following way: because on that day, hopefully, I will give you atonement to purify you of all your sins; You will be cleansed before Yahweh." 

Now the last Yahweh was also pronounced and the priests and the people sang and confessed: 

> “Praised be the name of the majesty of your kingdom forever and ever.”

Azazel's goat, the scapegoat of the town itself, was then handed over to the one who was to lead it into the desert. He was accompanied by the elders of the town, who, as representatives of the town, traveled with him the path of atonement. Once in the vicinity of a predetermined rock, they stayed behind while the driver of the goat led him to the rock; there the crimson band was split in two, one part was tied to the rock, the other to the horns of the he-goat and hurled backwards from the rock, so that he crashed. The scapegoat took the sins of the people with him into the desert, supposed to be the place of residence of the demons, and disappeared with them. Meanwhile, the calf and the goat were burned on the altar of burnt offering in the temple. As soon as news of the arrival of Azazel's goat in the desert reached the high priest, he read aloud the intended passages (Lev 16:1ff and 23:26-32) and pronounced the eight blessings of the Torah at the temple service. , followed by thanksgiving and supplications for the forgiveness of sins, for the sanctuary, Israel, the priests, plus a blessing as a final prayer. The day ended with a new great sacrifice of a ram, performed by the high priest in his golden garments, after a new immersion bath, for himself, and another for the people of seven unblemished lambs. After the evening sacrifice, which followed, the high priest was again accompanied home, “and he organized a feast for his friends, because he had again left the temple in peace.”

The effects of the day of forgiveness were summed up in this sentence: «For the transgressions of man towards God, the day of forgiveness holds atonement; but for the relations between any man and his neighbor, the day of forgiveness does not hold expiation until said individual does not satisfy his neighbor ». This principle was the result of multiple discussions between the doctors of the Law, which continued even when the day of forgiveness could no longer be celebrated in the prescribed manner. The result of the day of forgiveness is that the Israelites acquired a new heart and remained pure as the angels. “If the Israelites, plunged into sin as a result of the evil impulses that are in them, turn to repentance, God forgives their sins annually and renews their hearts, so that they fear him.”

The problem with these interpretations was that many times national sin was put before individual sin, giving more importance to the performance of the annual purification rites, than to personal repentance for the sins committed by each man or woman, and the correction of those faults. This is one of the chapters most fought by Jesus of Nazareth in his preaching. 

## Feast of Tents or Tabernacles

The festival of _Sucot or Januyot_ (in Greek: _Escenopegia_) commemorated the life in tents of the Jews as they passed through the desert. It was a festival of joy that prohibited all work for seven days and where everyone built huts, cabins or tents and slept in them at night. They also stayed next to the piles of the harvest or next to the vats and jars of the fruits. His scriptural fixation is in Leviticus (Lev 23:24).

It was celebrated from the 15th to the 22nd of the month of Tishri, that is, it lasted 7 days after the 15th. Originally it was a harvest festival, because before it was celebrated in the vineyards. Hence the manifestations of joy and sleeping in huts or tents. Normally, at the end, a supplication was made for a season of abundant rains, and for a profuse harvest the following year. The festival was also related to events in Jewish history. Lodging in cabins, where they ate and slept, was obligatory in Israel for men and boys, and voluntary for women and children, slaves and the sick. It commemorated the period of sojourn in the desert and the miracles of relief and preservation experienced by Israel. There were many symbols in this party,

Pilgrims were required to carry four types of tree branches: a bundle of green closed palm branches (_lulab_), willow branches (_aravot_), citron (_ethrog_), known as the apple and forbidden fruit of paradise, and leafy tree branches (_hassadim_). The set of these bouquets were called the _Arbat Minim_. The origin of this commandment is in Leviticus: “On the first day take fruitful branches of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, branches of leafy trees, and willows from the streams, and rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days”[ Lev 23:40]. It was said that whoever had the largest and most curved branches, had more faith in the Lord, and therefore they reached a considerable height. These branches were shaken in the four directions of the cardinal points with acclamations and prayers, a ceremony called _Netilat lulab_. Hence, this festival also received the name “festival of the bouquets”. Outside of Jerusalem, the proper place to wave the festive bouquet, which every Israelite was obliged to do, was the synagogue during divine service.

This was the festival of festivals, since all sacrifices that had been left out on the other festivals could be made on this one. On this occasion the offerings for the temple were received. It was a combination of the pleasures of the holidays with the solemn rites of religious worship. This was a time of rejoicing for the Jews, mixed with sacrifices, Levitical songs and the solemn notes of the silver trumpets of the priests. [UB 162:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p4_2).

At night, the extraordinary spectacle of the temple and its throngs of pilgrims was brilliantly lit by the great chandeliers that burned sparkling in the women's court, as well as by the glow of hundreds of torches placed in the temple courts. The whole city was gaily decorated, except for the Roman castle of Antonia, a somber sign in the celebration of the occupation of Rome.

During the festival, seventy oxen were sacrificed, a symbol of the seventy nations of paganism. The water ceremony symbolized the spreading of the divine spirit. This water ceremony occurred after the procession of the priests and Levites at dawn. Worshipers descended the steps that led from the Court of Israel to the Court of Women, as successive notes were played on silver trumpets. Then, the faithful went down to the Beautiful Gate, which opened onto the Court of the Gentiles. Here they turned to face west, repeat their songs, and continue the symbolic water procession. [UB 162:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p4_3).

On the last day of the festival nearly 450 priests officiated with a corresponding number of Levites. At dawn pilgrims from all over the city gathered, palms in hand. These pilgrims were divided into three groups for this morning ceremony. One group remained in the temple to attend the morning sacrifices; another went down in procession from Jerusalem to near Maza to cut the willow branches intended to adorn the sacrificial altar (they were taken from sacred grounds owned by the temple), while the third group formed a procession to march from the temple following the priest with the water, who, to the sound of the silver trumpets, carried the golden jug containing the symbolic water, going out through Ophel to near the pool of Siloam, near the gate of the Fountain. Once the jug was filled in the pond, the procession marched back to the temple, entering through the Water Gate and going directly to the courtyard of the priests, where the priest who carried the water jug ​​joined the priest who brought the wine as an offering. of drink. These two priests then went to the silver funnels that led to the base of the altar, and poured the contents of the jars into them. The execution of this rite of pouring the wine and water marked the moment when the assembled pilgrims began to sing Psalms 113 to 118 inclusive, alternately with the Levites, or Hallel or Hallelujah songs. As they repeated these verses, they waved their bunches of branches towards the altar. Sacrifices for that day were then performed, associated with the repetition of the psalm of the day, relegating Psalm 82 to the last of the party, beginning with the fifth verse. [UB 162:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p4_4)

## Feast of the consecration, dedication, restoration or purification of the temple 

In Hebrew: _Hannuká_ 

Feast that commemorated the restoration of the cult of the temple by the Maccabees. It was celebrated on the 25th day of the month of Kislev. They lasted eight days, and it was celebrated like the festival of the tents, with branches and palms and singing hymns. 

The Feast of the Consecration of the Temple was a late festival in Israel's history. On the 25th of Kislev in the year 164 BC, three years after the same day that the temple was profaned and destroyed under Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the cult was restored by Judas Maccabee and his followers. The time was from November to December, which could coincide with the winter solstice. About the party and its origin we are informed by 1 Mac 4:36-59; 2 Mac 1:9.18; 10:1-8, and Josephus, AJ XIII 7:7.

It was called “the Feast of Tabernacles in the month of Kislev.” The news underlines that the Israelites celebrated the festival for eight days “with jubilation and joy” and that Judas Maccabee would have decided that it be repeated annually in the same way. It was celebrated in the manner of the Feast of Tabernacles, carrying tenders, green branches and palms, singing hymns to the Lord, etc. It is also called the “festival of the luminaries”, because lights were lit progressively every day in a candelabrum with eight arms and a larger one or _hanuquiá_. On the first night, only the main arm and a candle are lit, and each night a candle is increased, until the last day in which the entire chandelier is fully lit. This fact commemorates the miracle that the oil lasted for eight days. These luminaries had the symbolic meaning that during the desecration of the temple “the exercise of religion appeared unexpectedly like a ray of light”, thanks to the Maccabean renewal. The rabbis called it the Hanukkah festival.

The precept reading of the Scripture is Nm 7:1ss and Zec 2:13s, where 4:2ss had special importance. 

It is customary for children to play with a sevivon or dreidel, which is a type of whirligig. This Hanukkah whirligig has four faces, each with a Hebrew letter: נ (“Nun”); ג (“Gimel”); ה (“I have”); ש (“Shin”) or פ (“Pei”). The four letters stand for _Nes gadol haia sham_, which means, “A great miracle happened there.” In Israel the fourth letter is פ instead of ש, and the acronym stands for _Nes gadol haia po_, which translates to “A great miracle happened here.” 

It is also customary to eat _levivot_ and _sufganiot_, potato pancakes and dumplings filled with jam. 

## Purim or 

lottery festival In Hebrew, from Persian: _Purim_

Feast that commemorated among the Jews the date on which they got rid of the massacre decreed by Haman, in the time of Ahasuerus. It was celebrated on the 14th and 15th of the month of Adar (February-March), after the 13th the festival was celebrated in memory of the battle against Nicanor. Days 14 and 15 corresponded to days in memory of Mordecai and Esther. According to history, the dates had been chosen by Haman by drawing lots. It was traditional to read the book of Esther (Esther 9:11-32); they also drank and made manifestations of joy (gifts, meals, etc.). It was a national celebration holiday, especially for the eastern diaspora.

Although Purim is considered one of the happiest days in the Hebrew calendar, Jews are required to fast and pray on the eve, in remembrance of the Persian Jews who fasted and prayed to God to save them from the coming conflict. it would lead to their annihilation and extermination by Haman and his followers in the army of the Persian Empire. On Purim the Megillah is read (in Hebrew מְגִילַת אֶסְתֵּר, _Megillat Esther_, «Roll or Book of Esther»). This reading is done at high speed, and those who listen must make noise with rattles or other elements at the moment the name of Aman is pronounced, so that said name is erased. This succeeds in engaging the children.

After fasting, a great banquet is held in which it is customary to drink wine and recite songs, among them the prayer known as _Shoshanat Ya'akov_ is usually recited. Likewise, it is an obligation to send gifts to friends (Hebrew: מנות משלוח, _Mislóach Manot_) and give charity to the poor (Hebrew: לאביונים מתנות, _Matanot La'evionîm_) and it is also customary to dress up small children. 

For Purim special sweets are prepared, called “Aman's Ears”. Men are allowed to drink wine up to the level of “confusing the names of Haman and Mordechai”, that is, getting drunk.

_Shoshanat Ya'akov_ (Ya'akov's Rose) is a Jewish prayer found in the Song of Songs (in Hebrew _Shir Hashirim_) in which the Jewish people are compared to a rose. _Shoshaná_ (rose) is a reference to Shushan (the city of Susa, in ancient Persia), as it says in the Book of Esther the verse “the city of Shushan celebrated and rejoiced” (Est 8:15). 

A translation of the Shoshanat Ya'akov would be:

> «The rose of Jacob (Ya'akov) was filled with emotion and joy when they had Mordechai dressed in royal blue. You have always been his salvation, his hope in every generation, to make it known that everyone who puts their hope in You will not be put to shame, nor will all those who trust in You be forever in disgrace. Cursed be Haman, who tried to destroy me; blessed be Mordechai the Jew. Cursed be Zeresh the wife of Haman, who terrified me; blessed be Esther who interceded for me. Cursed be all the wicked; blessed be all the upright; and may Jarvoná be favorably remembered.” 

## Feast of Passover 

Hebrew: _Pesah_; in Greek: _Paskhal_; in Latin: _Pascham_.

Solemn festival of the Jews that commemorated the departure from Egypt and the passage (Passover) of the desert. On the 14th day of 
Nisan, the first month of the religious year, coinciding with the full moon, the Passover festival was celebrated at sunset. From the 15th to the 21st of Nisán, the Feast of the Ácimos (festival of the _massot_) was celebrated. 

In Aramaic Pesah means “pass”, meaning that Yahweh “passed” in the sense of “saved”. But it is possible that the Egyptian word from which it derives meant “strike” (God struck) in relation to the tenth plague of Egypt that allowed the escape of the Jews.

Originally it was a festival that offered the first fruits (from the flock the lamb, from the barley harvest the unleavened bread, etc.). With the events of the exodus he was filled with the historical meaning of that trip. Moses seems to have instructed them to celebrate the Paschal rite by killing a lamb or a kid, offering it to God, bleeding it and staining the doors of the houses with its blood, eating it with traveling clothes. The party lasted for seven days.

It is the great Israelite festival of pilgrimage, in which many thousands of Jews flocked to Jerusalem from all over the world, and was part of the three great festivals (_Shelóshet Ha'regalim_), along with Shavuot and Sukkot, in which it was customary to make a pilgrimage to the temple in Jerusalem. It was preceded by purification ceremonies about a week before. Only the Passover lamb could be slaughtered and eaten in Jerusalem. As long as the temple stood, the Passover feast outside of Jerusalem was a feast without a Passover lamb. Pilgrims gathered in groups of at least ten people for the Easter banquet. In this way it was possible for many people to consume the Passover lamb, a one-year-old lamb or kid; for of the Passover lamb there should be no remains. Women and children took part in the festival and the banquet. The poor also, without exception, would participate in the Easter banquet, since it was within the usual beneficence of the people of God that the wealthy groups facilitate participation in the banquet without restrictions. The Passover lambs would be purchased about four days before the feast. They slaughtered each other in the temple on the eve of Passover night after noon, while the great Hallel was sung; At sunset the great banquet began, which lasted until midnight, and during which no one was allowed to leave Jerusalem. That is why the venue for the banquet had to be searched for and prepared in advance. Since this was a festive banquet, the diners lay on cushions. Apart from the Passover lamb, there was wine, bread,

The ceremonial dinner (_Seder_) followed this custom: 

1. Sitting at the table, at sunset, the preparation of the first cup takes place. The father or head of the table pronounces a blessing, the qiddus, and then the cup is drunk. He first utters this praise: 

	> «Praise be to you, Yahweh, our God, King of the world, who created the fruit of the vine». 

2. And then the _qiddus_, which read: 
	
	> «Praise be to you, Yahweh, our god, King of the world, who gave your people Israel holidays to celebrate and remember. Praised be you, Yahweh, who sanctifies Israel and the times».

3. Family members perform the first hand washing of the night without blessing (_Urjatz_). A pitcher of water is brought to the table for the Seder conductor to perform ablution without moving from the spot. 
4. An aperitif based on celery (_carpas_) bathed in salt was taken. 
5. Then came the _yajatz_, the division into two pieces of one of the three unleavened breads (_matza_). The larger piece was kept aside, while the smaller piece was left together with the other unleavened bread.
6. Then the second cup or cup of the Haggadah was poured, and the _pesá_ or paschal rite took place: It is introduced by the question of a child or any diner about the meaning of the properties of the banquet: «_ ¿Manishtaná halaila hazé micol haleilot?_» (Why is this night different from all other nights?). The father responds with the account of the departure from Egypt; the liturgical foundation was provided by Dt 26:5-11, provided with the necessary interpretations. 
7. The second ablution with the prayer “_Al Netilat Iadaim_” (“That you ordered us to wash our hands!”) immediately proceeding to eat the _matzah_. 
8. The first part of the Hallel was recited and then the second cup, called the cup of the Haggadah or _Mishpat_, was drunk.
9. Then the unleavened bread was distributed, a small portion to each diner and a blessing (_motzi_) was pronounced before eating them: “Praise be to you, Lord, our God, King of the world, who makes bread come out of the earth” . The diners answered “amen”, and then the bread was distributed to them. The father of the house would take the last piece and start eating, which was the signal to everyone that the banquet had begun. 
10. The banquet began with the first course, the entree, which consisted of various bitter vegetables (_maror_), which were made more digestible by dipping them in a sauce called _jarôset_. They also offered each other pieces of bread spread with sauce and vegetables. 
11. Normally, the Easter lamb or kid (one year old) would come later.
12. The piece of unleavened bread that had been set aside was left for last. The banquet ends with the prayer of thanksgiving for the third cup, called the cup of blessing. This prayer of thanksgiving could be as follows: 
	
	> «Praise be to you, Lord, our God, who feeds the whole world with your goods, your grace, your mercy. We thank you, Lord our God, because you allowed us to take possession of a good and spacious land. Have mercy, Lord our God, on Israel, your people, and on Jerusalem, your city, and on Zion, the seat of your majesty, and on your altar and your temple. Praise be to you, Lord, who builds Jerusalem."

13. Finally the _Hallel_ (_Sal_ 115-118) was sung and a fourth cup was still drunk after blessing it or cup of the _Hallel_. Then dinner was over. Diners used to continue it until late at night talking and having a good time. 

The whole dinner was full of symbolism and meaning: 

* The wine glasses: they expressed the joy of the Jewish people for having been taken out of Egypt. 
* Unleavened bread (unleavened bread, _matzah_): expressed the departure of the Jewish people from Egypt, since they left in a hurry and the breads they took on their trip were breads that had not been given time to ferment. 
* Bitter herbs (_maror_): a very chopped horseradish to produce tears and that expressed bitterness for the slavery of their ancestors.
* The sauce (_jarôset_): represented the mortar with which the Jewish slaves had to build the constructions of the pharaoh. 
* Celery or parsley (_carpas_) bathed in salt to commemorate the taste of the exodus. 
* Lettuce or salad (_jazeret_): it was taken with the radish and could have been some plant that the Jews ate in the desert.
* The Passover lamb: it expressed the compassionate behavior of God, who killed all the firstborn of the Egyptians and saved those of the Jews, because they stained the doorposts with the blood of the lambs. The name “Passover”, which is the Latin word, comes from Pesach, which in Hebrew means “passage”, or “sweeping”, because God passed and swept the Egyptians. In conclusion, the lamb had a meaning of death to the enemies of Israel and that is why the animal was killed. Animal sacrifice was a constant ritual practice in those days, not only among Jews, but among all civilized people. The idea was held that divine favor was gained through the blood of the innocent animal victim, and that there was no divine hearing if these bloody acts were not performed.

The events of Passover were associated with memories of the exodus from Egypt; the memory of the great deeds was alive in them. he doctors of the Law said: «In each generation man is obliged to consider himself when he came out of Egypt». The cultic celebration transfers the subsequent participants to the original situation and thereby makes them participants in God's action. That is why they join the crowd of those who praise: «For this we are obliged to give thanks, to extol, to praise, to magnify, to exalt, to celebrate, to bless, to sublimate and to sing to the one who did this miracle to our parents and all of us, leading us from servitude to freedom, from affliction to joy and from mourning to the feast day, from darkness to great light and from submission to salvation,

The Israelites called the night of Passover the “night of vigilance”, and they associated that night, which God himself watches over and guards, with messianic hopes, putting his thought, on the model of liberation from Egypt, in the eternal liberation . Passover night will be the time of the appearance of the Messiah for Israel. Accordingly, a series of places in the great Hallel must be given not only a historical and retrospective interpretation, but also a messianic and prospective one.

Passover lasts only one night, the “Christmas Eve of Israel.” It is followed, beginning on Nisan 15, by the festival of the massot, that of the Unleavened Leaves, also popularly called Easter, which lasts seven days, so that the entire series of eight festival days could be called Easter. It was a time of joy, especially for pilgrims who came to Jerusalem from afar; they arrived before the festival and remained in Jerusalem throughout, while for the most part the pilgrims from the vicinity left Jerusalem already on the second day after Passover night. That the festival of the massot was at the same time a festival of thanksgiving for the harvest is deduced from the fact that, on its third, the 16th of Nisan, the first fruits of the new harvest were offered in the temple.

## Feast of the harvest, of the first fruits or of the fifty days 

In Hebrew: _Shavuot_; in Greek: _Pentecost_. 

It received other names depending on the explanation that was given of the party: 

* _Jag HaShavuot_ (Feast of the weeks): It receives this name because it is celebrated at the end of the seven weeks of _Sefirat Ha'omer_ whose daily count had been undertaken on the second night of _Pesach_. 
* _Zeman Matan Toratenu_ (Time of Giving of our Torah): According to Jewish tradition, this is the date on which the Jewish People received the Torah (the Law), on Mount Sinai. 
* _Chag Hacatsir_ (Harvest Festival): In the Land of Israel, this is the time of harvest, especially that of wheat.
* _Jag Habicurim_ (First Fruits Day): The Feast of _Shavuot_ marked the beginning of the time to offer the “first fruits”, “_Bicurim_”. 
* _Atséret_ (Conclusion): In rabbinical sources, _Shavuot_ is mentioned as a conclusion, since the Sages consider it linked to the festival of _Pesaj_, being the historical conclusion of it. 

Feast that commemorated among the Jews the day on which God gave the tablets of the law to Moses on Mount Sinai. It was also intended to thank God for the crops. It was celebrated 49 days, seven weeks, after Easter, that is, on the 50th day counting from the Easter feast.

In the same way that the Feast of Tabernacles, after seven feast days, had a great final feast on the eighth day, Passover and the Massot also had their final feast, although separated fifty days from the main feast, something that the rabbis did not they considered strange. Only winter justified, in the case of the Feast of Tabernacles, bringing the final feast back to the main feast.

Originally, a separate festival of thanksgiving for the harvest at the end of the harvest was related to Passover and the massot. That it was set fifty days after Nisan 16 shows its character as a harvest festival. It was well known as the Feast of the “Fiftieth Day” (Pentecost), or the Feast of Weeks, or the Final Feast. From the festive precepts of Lv 23 16-22 it is clear that this is a thanksgiving holiday for the flocks to be shed and the harvest to be finished. In Palestine it lasted one day; in the diaspora, two. 

The rabbinical tradition put it in relation to the delivery of the Law in Sinai, establishing, according to that, the readings indicated for it.

Dairy was eaten at the festive meal. Sweet cheese crepes (_blintzes_) are typical of _Shavuot_.

# The day of forgiveness 

Three were the main Jewish holidays in the calendar at the time of Jesus. They all took place during the dry season, to facilitate pilgrimages to Jerusalem, a place of special longing to celebrate these festivities. In early spring, the religious calendar began with Easter, between March and April. Seven Sundays later, the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost in Greek) was celebrated around May. And closing the dry season, between September and October, the festival of Forgiveness and Shops.

The latter represented the end of the most significant festivities. Here the official rest period of the Jews ended, and the return to work and routine began again. From that moment on, they had to return to the fields to prepare the land for the new crops. 

Many authors see these three ancient festivals as reminiscent of harvest-related festivals: Easter with early harvests, such as flax; the Weeks with intermediate crops, such as barley and wheat; and the Forgiveness and the Stores with the late harvests, the vintage and the dates. And it is easy to think this, since it was the obligation of some of these parties to deliver certain tithes of the harvests obtained.

The Day of Atonement, also called the Day of Atonement or _Yom Kippur_, is an important day in the Jewish calendar. Sabbath prescriptions were carried to extreme fulfillment on this day. Any type of activity was strictly prohibited, with very few exceptions. The day was to be dedicated to fasting, reflection and penance. It was forbidden to eat, drink, wash, put on ointments, put on shoes and make love. The high priest himself dressed that day in an austere way, with a simple white robe as a sign of purity and without ornaments or decorations in his clothing. Nor did he wear the usual pectoral, a huge jewel that hung like a necklace with several precious stones set in it.

The theme of ritual purity, which caused Jesus so many headaches, was carried to exaggeration on this day. The high priest, to avoid contracting any type of impurity (it could be contracted by thousands of ridiculous situations) isolated himself seven days before in his house, alone in a room, the office of the high priest. When he leaves there it is only to attend the obligatory morning and evening sacrifices, and he does so amid spectacular security measures.

The data shown in _The expected beginning_ about an event that prevented a high priest from officiating the feast is taken from _Jerusalem in the time of Jesus_. In the chapter dedicated to the high priest, Joachim Jeremías comments on a passage from the rabbinical treatise Yomá. Apparently, the high priest Simeon ben Kamith, from the time of Jesus (17 - 18 AD), on the eve of the Day of Atonement, at nightfall, received a spittle from an Arab sheikh (perhaps because of an argument). The point is that this caused him to contract impurity and he could not officiate the next day, so he had to be replaced in a hurry. This makes me think of these strange cases of substitutions (because there were more): what was there, a whole bench of reserve high priests? And all of them are recruited a week before? Presumably yes...

However, jokes aside, Jesus did not attend the Feast of Forgiveness that year 17-18. Very different occupations kept him away from Jerusalem at that time, in which he lived in Damascus. Perhaps one day I will have time to narrate it... 

What we can clearly appreciate from all this is the extreme obsession that existed at the time of Jesus among those of his people with this type of prescriptions, which were sometimes insufferable for the people flat. For now, these brief notes serve as an example of the religious and cultural environment that Jesus lived through.

# Jewish messianism 

The Jews were above all a people who put their zeal much more in religious practices than in beliefs. There was much more freedom of thought than praxis. While the rites and customs that had to be celebrated each day were regulated down to the last detail, the ideas and principles that framed the Jewish religion were not so rigid. It is within this framework that “messianism” was located, an ideological current that changed over the years from the moment it began as a current of thought until the time of Jesus. 

## Origin of messianism

Messianism is a school of thought that offered a possible explanation for the fate of the world. It originated as follows:

Initially, the Jews began to believe in the idea that their God, Yahweh, had chosen the Hebrew people as a special nation among all nations, in order to represent him in the world. On condition of preserving this privileged status, the Jews had to abide by the Torah, the law that their God had given them. If they fulfilled these precepts, God would reward the Jewish people in this life by granting them all sorts of blessings. Let us note here that there was still no concept of the individual destiny of each man. What mattered was the fate of the entire nation. Second, there was no idea of ​​life after death as a reward for compliance with the law. The prize was blessings in this life. Ultimately, what mattered was that God would reward only and exclusively the Israelite people. The rest of the nations

However, as the years passed, the Jews saw that this expected divine approval did not come, and century after century they suffered the oppression and domination of other empires. Therefore, when their spirits were at their lowest, they decided to place the hope of that glorious moment of acceptance by God in an uncertain future. This magnificent moment when God would finally bless the Hebrew people with preeminence over all the peoples of the Earth is what they called the “kingdom of God.” And a portentous being would be the great protagonist of this advent, a being who would be destined to become the right arm of God to make this “kingdom” a reality. They called this being “messiah”, since messiah is the word that meant “anointed”, Like kings, they were called “anointed” because the rite by which they became king included being impregnated (anointed) with an oil. Along with these ideas, others that had to do with each individual believer began to be considered, such as the possibility of a life after death, as well as the idea that the “kingdom of God” would be universal. The messiah would be the ruler of the entire world, and all nations would be forced to submit to his rule.

When did this change and transition of ideas occur? The truth is that there has not been an event that marked this fact. Since the first prophets there has always been a belief in a glorious “future”, but above all these ideas began to mature after the Maccabean uprising. 


How could this kind of religious conceptions be formed in a people so strict on religious issues? The fact is that the Jews placed great emphasis on faithfully preserving and transmitting the precepts and rites, as we have already said, but as far as religious ideas were concerned, they did not have a strict vision, which allowed for a notable effervescence of ideas and diverse concepts. 

## Evolution in the main messianic ideas 

### Present hope versus future hope

Initially, the hopes of the Jews were confined to the present. The action they expected from God would happen imminently here and now. However, as this hope of divine intervention faded, they formulated the belief that the kingdom of God would come in the vague but not too distant future. 

### Exalted Kingdom of Israel vs. Universal Kingdom of God

Initially, the idea of ​​the Jews was that God's precepts had to be fulfilled so that the Jewish kingdom would purify itself and live as an example among the peoples, because in this way God would exalt it among all nations. At first this ideal realm did not go beyond the current limits of the Holy Land. The Jews did not have a clear conception of what would happen to the rest of the nations. Over time, the prophets, especially after the exile in Babylon, began to see that the future kingdom of God would mean that Israel would be placed at the head of all nations as supreme ruler, and that the rest of the nations would have, either to be forcibly converted to the Jewish faith, or to be annihilated. This idea inaugurated a new concept of Yahweh as supreme God or universal God.

This idea had its origin in the political situation of the moment. Great empires began to rise that subjugated the small independent kingdoms. It was not difficult to imagine that the future ideal kingdom would be equivalent to a great empire that would superimpose itself on all existing ones. 

### National God vs. Individual God

In the beginning, Yahweh was only the God of the entire nation. The particular individual did not matter except insofar as he was part of the nation. It was the nation that would be saved or damned. Little by little, the writings are denoting a tendency to also worry about individual behavior. The hope of the “kingdom of God” had a consequence. If some would be honored with the privilege of being part of this divine realm, then God did show a certain respect of persons as well. The idea of ​​the resurrection strengthened this vision that God would favor certain individuals, those chosen for his glory, which made the prophets more insistent on the idea that each one should strive for himself, regardless of what the Lord did. rest of the town.

### Benefits in this life versus resurrection of souls 

The Jews believed that upon death the soul of the human being went to sheol, a place of rest where neither suffered nor felt happiness. There one simply remained unconscious, at rest. The reward for following the divine precepts was only received in this life, and they were normally seen as material rewards: many possessions, favorable harvests, abundant cattle, and above all, many children to maintain the inheritance. However, the idea of ​​the “kingdom of God” changed this.

If in the future God was going to establish a new glorious reign on Earth, then could it be that some privileged ones would rise from sheol to participate in this glorious reign? These ideas about the resurrection began to be incorporated into the Jewish people, although never in a homogeneous way. The most common idea, but not the only one, was that after a sojourn in sheol, the elect, a few, not many, would be resurrected in the future kingdom, where they would live a life of endless bliss. As for the sinners and the ungodly, some had the theory that they too would be resurrected, but for eternal punishment, while others believed that they would remain eternally in sheol, and that there would be no such punishment.

### The earthly Jerusalem versus the “new Jerusalem” 

The Jews came to believe that the city by which the Jerusalem of their day would be replaced already existed in heaven prepared by God, waiting to descend on Earth at that glorious moment in for the new kingdom to come. This idea further accentuates the divine vision of the new kingdom. It is no longer a matter of a material kingdom like those that have existed until then, but a divine kingdom. God would be their eternal king, the messiah their right arm, and their new capital, a Jerusalem not built by human hands. Life in this kingdom would be beatific and full of bliss, and Satan, who until then had been allowed as king of the world, would be deposed after a battle against him, and replaced by the Messiah.

What the idea of ​​a heavenly Jerusalem does is to enlarge even more than in the original conceptions the difference between the present kingdom, earthly Israel, and the future kingdom or “kingdom of God”. Formerly there was only one kingdom, the kingdom already existing on Earth, which would simply endure. Over time, this idea transitioned into a concept of a beatific and supernatural kingdom, which would be brought from Heaven to Earth and supplant, after destroying it, the earthly kingdom.

This change of mentality in the consideration of the future kingdom and how it would affect the individual through a universal judgment probably has its origin or at least its influence in the Persian religion. The Jews were subject to the Persian people for two hundred years and from them they borrowed many ideas about angels, demons, and the individual's retribution after death. Despite this, the originality of the Jewish concepts is notorious. 

## Messianic writings from its origin to the time of Jesus 

Although in the time of Jesus there was a revitalization of the concept of the Messiah, in the previous two centuries, which is when this idea emerged, there were times when the idea did not prosper much.

The first important influx occurred with the _book of Daniel_, which was written around 167 to 165 BC It was the calamitous time of Antiochus Epiphanes, and the author envisions a future liberation of the Jewish people. The kingdoms of the Earth, represented in the form of monstrous beasts, would be destroyed by God, whom the prophet curiously calls “Ancient of many days.” It is he who would inflict defeat on the last kings who would make war on him and who would deliver the resulting kingdom to the Jews, whom Daniel here calls the “holy ones of the Most High.” But the most enigmatic character of all Daniel's prophecies is a heavenly being, for he descends from Heaven, whom Daniel calls the “like son of man” (_bar nasha_). The book of Daniel is the only place in all the biblical texts in which this title or denomination appears (Dan 7:9-28), having to resort to an apocryphal text, the _book of Enoch_, to find it again. However, it was the denomination that Jesus of Nazareth used the most to refer to himself. Up to 66 times it appears in the synoptic gospels. Daniel identifies this character with a king who would be given dominion and control of the future kingdom, an eternal kingdom that would no longer have a rival, so it is clear that it was Daniel who initiated the idea of ​​the Messiah.

However, it seems that this idea about the Messiah did not find a special predicament in later times. The _book of Ecclesiasticus_, which also awaits the arrival of a future kingdom, however, never speaks of a messianic king. Everything else speaks of a second coming to Earth of the prophet Elijah, who was believed to arrive as a herald announcing the imminent wrath of God before the end of time and the formation of the eternal kingdom (Ecclesiastes 48:10).

The author of _1 Maccabees_, in turn, does not think of a future king either. For him the Hasmonean dynasty is already the culmination of all the promises of a restored Israelite kingdom. Nor does the text of _Tobias_ speak of a messiah, even when he mentions that heavenly Jerusalem that will be rebuilt with gold and precious stones instead of the current one. In the same tone we have the book of the _Wisdom of Solomon_, for whom the future life will be simply an awakening of the just who will dedicate themselves to judging non-Jewish peoples. 

As we see, after Daniel, the concept of the messiah was gradually abandoned. Life after death looked a-styleOld, as a permanence in _sheol_ waiting for a future moment in which a few would simply return to life and only with the purpose of being judges of those who were alive at that moment. Therefore, there was no need to think of a king, or a future kingdom, or a resurrection to a new life, an idea that Daniel had also inaugurated.

It was texts like the _Sibylline Oracles_ that repopularized the concept of the Messiah. Here again we have prophecies about the end times in which the kingdoms of the Earth would all be subject to a heavenly king placed by God on Earth (OrSib 3:286). Babylon (i.e. Persia), Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Greece, Rome, all these kingdoms would be exterminated and in their place there would only remain the messianic kingdom of God and the king called “Immortal”, a new way of referring to the Messiah (OrSib 3:46-48).

When messianism arrived with force, it was at the time when one of the books that make up the text _1 Henoch_, the so-called _book of Revelations and Parables_, was written. This text, of such a modern messianism that some scholars even see an author from the first century of our era, is usually considered to be from the first century BC. It delves into many concepts initiated by Daniel. Here the author speaks of a “Chosen”, God is called “Beginning of days”, a term that recalls the “Ancient of many days” of Daniel, and the “Chosen” is mentioned, as in Daniel, “Son of Man”. But it should be understood that this denomination is a title. What the author of Enoch clarifies, which Daniel already started, is that this being is celestial, since he resides together with God in Heaven, but his aspect, unlike that of God, it is more like that of a man, and also resembles that of an angel (1Hen 46:1-8). This character is clearly described as Messiah (1Hen 48:10), but now his role becomes more important. It is no longer God directly, as in Daniel, who will deal with the kings of the Earth, but this task will fall to the “Son of Man”. He will destroy the powerful and establish a kingdom of justice. Those who are in _sheol_ at that time will rise up, the Messiah will sit on the throne, and there will be a judgment that will decide who has been righteous and who has not. He will destroy the powerful and establish a kingdom of justice. Those who are in _sheol_ at that time will rise up, the Messiah will sit on the throne, and there will be a judgment that will decide who has been righteous and who has not. He will destroy the powerful and establish a kingdom of justice. Those who are in _sheol_ at that time will rise up, the Messiah will sit on the throne, and there will be a judgment that will decide who has been righteous and who has not.

The figure of the messianic king appears in all its color and clearly drawn in the _Psalms of Solomon_, a writing that is considered to be from the time of Pompey (63-48 BC). Although he establishes God as the true king of Israel, he does not miss an opportunity to mention a descendant of the house of David who would recover the material Jewish throne now in the hands of Rome. This king would be a just king with the power to defeat his enemies with the simple power of his voice, a power that will be repeated in many other places, meaning that he will no longer need weapons to establish this beatific kingdom (SalSl 17: 1-42).

The writings of Flavius ​​Josephus (Ant. XVII, 2, 4: 43ff) let us see that in Herod's time messianic hopes were not lacking. When the Pharisees negotiated with Herod's brother Feroras to overthrow him, it was clear that they were waiting for the imminent arrival of a messianic king, not placing Feroras as king. 

The late author of the _Assumption of Moses_, a writing dating from the first century of the Christian era, also speaks of a new age of mankind when God finally decides to assume leadership of Israel directly, bringing destruction to the rest of the towns (AsMo 10).

The _book of Jubilees_ describes in great detail what life will be like in the world once the reign of God arrives. Here, instead of a descendant of David, the author only promises an inexhaustible offspring to the descendants of Jacob, but little or nothing is said of a messianic king (Jub 23:27-31; 32:18-19). 

That messianism was gaining interest at the time of Jesus is shown by the fact that _Filón_ already echoes it in his work «On the reward of the good and the punishment of the wicked», in which he elaborates descriptions of the future beatific world that will come with the divine reign. The beasts will no longer be dangerous to man and all nations will be forced to live in peace (De Praem. 15:80-90; 16:95-97).

Already in the time of Jesus and in the Christian beginnings, the messianic faith had reached its highest levels. This is what explains why supposed messiahs like Theudas or El Epipcio arose, or why the Jewish people launched into open rebellion against Rome. After the devacle with the destruction of the temple, the Jewish people, far from abandoning their messianic belief, continued to endow it with new hopes located in an imprecise future. This is what texts like the _Apocalypse of Baruch and Esdras_ allow us to see. First there will be a period of terrible and widespread confusion, but then the Messiah will come in all his might, destroying all nations and establishing an everlasting kingdom of righteousness (ApBar 70:2-10). 

## Messianic ideas at the time of Jesus

We have already seen that when Jesus makes his appearance there was a unique breeding ground for messianic ideas in the Jewish people. The concept of the Messiah had evolved from the first announcements of Daniel, through a good number of authors such as the text of Enoch, until reaching the time of Philo. Despite the many differences that the concept of messianism represented to the Jewish mind at the time of Jesus, there were certain elements in this belief that were common and shared by all Jews. What was the messianic belief composed of in Jesus' time?

* _The test and final confusions_. All the Jewish people thought that before the beatific kingdom of God arrived, a period of calamities and afflictions would first occur. The sun and moon would set, swords would appear in the sky, and columns of horsemen would ride in the clouds. All kinds of omens and wonders would occur, signs and signals that would mark an imminent end. Even men, as if driven mad, would fight each other, sons against fathers, daughters against mothers, and nations against nations. The Messiah, in fact, when he appeared, it was said that he would first have to go through the so-called “birth pains of the Messiah” (_hbly ha mesyah_), a theory very much in vogue at the beginning of Christianity (the suffering Messiah) and that caused rivers of ink to flow .
* _Elías and other precursors_. Before the Messiah, a great prophet would arrive announcing his arrival. Many thought it would be the ancient prophet Elijah brought back to life (Mal 3:23-24). Elijah's mission would be to establish peace in the world. It seems that Elijah would come with the power to change people's hearts, at least temporarily, and establish a new period where all wars would cease (Mal 4:5). For this reason, a very frequent saying at the time of Jesus when two people argued about something without getting anywhere was then to leave that dispute “until Elijah came”, because he thought he would settle all those disagreements. Jesus in a way, and then later Christianity, clearly used these beliefs to apply the title of Elijah to John the Baptist.
* _The coming of the Messiah_. After the confusion and then the peace of the Forerunner, the Messiah would finally come. Known as Messiah (_hamesiyah_ in Hebrew), Anointed or Christos (in Greek), the “Chosen”, the “son of God”, or the “son of David”. Some, very few, named him as the “son of man”, despite being the oldest title that had been applied to him. He was expected above all to be a human being of flesh and blood, and not a heavenly being, despite the prophecies of Daniel. He was expected to have unblemished ancestry, of course in the line of David's genealogy, and he was expected to be a born leader who came to garner himself the titles of king and high priest. Despite being human, he was expected to be endowed by God with unimaginable powers. That he was a man of exemplary justice and unparalleled wisdom. The time when it would appear was a mystery although some rabbis claimed to have discovered, after exhaustive calculations, when it would occur. Many unbelievers used the expression “for when the Messiah comes” as a mockery, wanting to indicate a very distant time. What was thought, yes, is that the Messiah would only come if the united people did acts of penance and repentance. His appearance would be sudden and unexpected, although since he would have to be born like any child in this world, it was believed that for a time that child should be hidden. is that the Messiah would only come if the united people did acts of penance and repentance. His appearance would be sudden and unexpected, although since he would have to be born like any child in this world, it was believed that for a time that child should be hidden. is that the Messiah would only come if the united people did acts of penance and repentance. His appearance would be sudden and unexpected, although since he would have to be born like any child in this world, it was believed that for a time that child should be hidden.
* _The attack of the Messiah against the hostile powers_. The Messiah would not simply be a wise and holy man. He would have to be a great warrior and warlord to fit the prevailing ideas of his person. All the pagan nations of the Earth would unite in an attack against the Messiah who was believed to be led by a little-known figure called the “Antichrist.” Still others believed in a reappearance of Gog and Magog in the ranks of evil. Another prevailing idea is that a certain “Milkiresa” would appear, a “Prince of Evil” similar to the “Antichrist” who would be like an antithesis of the ancient Jewish “King of Justice”, Milkisedeq (or Melchizedek). The Messiah, in an epic combat, would single-handedly defeat all the enemy armies. His greatest weapon would be the power of his voice, but of course also the fact that God himself would be with him and act through him. It should also be said that this idea was not generalized. Some, the least, considered the Messiah simply a wise judge who would come after God himself destroyed the wicked kingdoms, but he would not be a warrior. However, these ideas appeared especially later in the Christian era and motivated by an attempt to adapt the figure of Jesus to a new type of Messiah.
* _The universal judgment_. Following the spectacular defeat of the evil armies, a judgment of all men and women would proceed. Some would wake from the dead to receive their verdict; others, those already alive, logically would not require a resurrection. The future life of the individual would depend on whether he was found guilty or innocent. The guilty would suffer eternal torment (in one or several places, the most well-known called _gehenna_) while the righteous would live forever in the divine kingdom that from that moment would be established on Earth. This idea of ​​the resurrection of those who had died before the judgment was not shared by all Jewish circles. The Sadducees, for example, denied it. The Hellenistic Jews substituted a resurrection of the soul, but not of the body. The majority tendency, however, was Pharisaical and accepted this resurrection as a return to life in human form again. Where the dead were before the resurrection, when they were resurrected, and how many were resurrected were matters on which the Jews disagreed. There was a belief that some outstanding men, such as Enoch, Moses, Elijah, Ezra and others, had returned to life in Heaven immediately after death. Hellenistic Jews even thought that all just men were immediately admitted to Heaven and that only those doubtful of their virtue would have to wait for the final resurrection. Nor was there a unanimous idea about who was resurrected. The oldest belief was that everyone was resurrected, although many did so only to receive their verdict of eternal damnation. The most common later idea at the time of Jesus was that only the righteous were resurrected. The wicked went straight to their place of torment without enjoying any return to life in a new body.
* _The renewal of Jerusalem_. The seat and capital of the heavenly kingdom would of course be Jerusalem, but a revamped version. The idea was held that a heavenly Jerusalem had already existed in Heaven since time immemorial, which would descend on Earth and replace the mundane Jerusalem invaded by sinners and Gentiles. 
* _The reunion of the scattered Jews_. It was the idea that most unified the Jewish people and it was the hope that once the messianic kingdom was established, all Jews, no matter where they were, would be reunited as if by magic in the Holy Land. This meeting of the ten tribes was a very frequent discussion in Jewish scholarly circles. There were those who considered this fact impossible.
* _The glorious kingdom of God_. Once the new order was established, from there the world would enter the era of the reign of God. Until now, God had not exercised his power and had not shown himself to be the true ruler of the world. That is why the Jews had to live subject to other peoples. This situation was explained by arguing that God acted in this way to test his people. But now God would act as the ruler of the world, and the Jewish subjugation and all the patience that had been had with the Gentiles would end. From there, either the Gentile nations agreed to submit to the heavenly government, or they would be annihilated. That is why many prophecies foretold that at some point all nations would accept the Jewish God and abandon their false religious beliefs. Life in this heavenly realm would be perfect. There would be no disputes, peace and harmony would reign, there would be no old age or illness, and women would no longer experience pain in childbirth. The land would be worked without fatigue and would bear abundant and inexhaustible fruit with little effort.

## Adoption of messianism by Christianity

All of these conceptions were in vogue at the time of Jesus, having evolved from primitive ancient concepts to more modern ones. When Jesus enters the scene, the concepts of the “kingdom of God” acquire a new force for the followers of the Master. They do not hesitate to see in Jesus that special being of the prophecies to whom God would delegate his authority to establish the heavenly kingdom on Earth. It is not surprising that the apostles and their followers believed with total certainty that the world was about to end and that Jesus was going to proclaim himself king of the world. That was precisely what marked the arrival of the Messiah. This prodigious being would only appear in the world in the moments before the end of time,

But something, however, came to completely dislodge the apostles. Because, did Jesus really fit the prevailing concepts about the Messiah?

# The Jewish synagogue 

## Meanings

In Aramaic, the synagogue was usually designated as knst or knyst (keneset), which came to mean “the religious congregation.” Here the meaning was oriented to the community aspect of the word. It was not about designating a place reserved for worship, but about the act of meeting itself. The important thing for the Jews was not the place of worship. The only place of worship that the Jews of Jesus' day truly revered was the temple in Jerusalem. The synagogues were just a place to meet to discuss matters of community interest, which were almost always of a religious nature. It must be said that in the following centuries, after the destruction of the temple, the attitude of the Jews towards the synagogue changed until it became the center of their customs.

Hence, the Greek words chosen to translate keneset came to mean among non-Jews something similar to “congregation” or “assembly”: _synagogé_, _sýnodos_ or _ecclesían_. 

It could also be designated as _proseucha_ or _proseuché_. Here it refers more to the building itself that housed the meetings. 

## Origin 

The origin of synagogues dates back to the time of exile, and emerged as a form of meeting to instruct and communicate the Torah, the actual Jewish writings, and not lose sight of Jewish customs in the midst of so much foreign influence. That is, they did not originally have the purpose of serving religious worship, but rather everything consisted of a simple social gathering for educational purposes and for strengthening community ties.

However, in the time of Jesus it was widely believed that the institution of the synagogue came from Moses himself. 

## Organization 

We must distinguish between the elders (_archontes_, _presbiteroi_, _geroysiarches_, the latter the chief of all), who were in charge of the affairs of the congregation in general, and then a group of officials to attend to specific matters, among which there always had to be: the arch-synagogue (_archisynagogus_) or president of the synagogue, the beggar (_gby sdqh_), and the minister of the synagogue (_hazán_). 

The archsynagogue or president of the synagogue

In Aramaic it was said _ros ha-keneset_. He is the director of the cult. The responsibility of this position was to attend public worship. He was the person, for example, in charge of inviting the right speaker to perform the reading, the prayer, as well as for the preaching. He used to choose one of the elders for the position. It was his job, generally speaking, to see that nothing improper happened in the synagogue, and it is probable that he was also in charge of the care of the synagogue buildings. See Mark 5:22.35.36.38; Luke 8:49; Luke 13:14.

We know an example of an archsynagogue from the Gospel, where Jairus, the archsynagogue of Capernaum, is mentioned, and who very probably, after the miraculous healing of his daughter thanks to Jesus, must have become a follower of the Master. See Mark 5:21-43; Matt 9:18-26; Luke 8:40-56. This deduction appears as is in [UB 154:1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p1). 

The Almoner 

In Aramaic _gby sdqh_. He collected for the poor. There were two types of collections: 

- The weekly alms basket (_qwph_ or _cupa_), from which what was necessary to help the poor of the locality once a week was taken.

- the “tray” (tmhwy), from which anyone in need, especially foreigners, could receive a daily portion. But only those who did not have enough food for two meals a day could apply for this charity. 

The minister of the synagogue 

In Aramaic _hzn hknst_, _hazán_ or _chazán ha-keneset_. In Greek synonyms such as _yperetes_ or _diachonos_ were used. His task was to prepare the sacred texts for the service and put them back in place after the service was over; he was also in charge of announcing the beginning and the end of Saturday at the sound of the trumpet. His tasks were very varied. He could both be in charge of executing the punishment of those condemned to whipping, as well as dedicate himself to teaching children to read.

The reader of the scriptures, the reciter of the prayer, and the preacher 

In Aramaic _slyh shwr_. There were no official officials for these tasks. This work was entrusted to one of the community, or each of the three tasks to different people. It could also fall on someone prominent who was passing through. It is in this way that Jesus was able to speak on many occasions during his visits to the Jewish populations. 

## Powers 

In strictly Jewish populations, the institution monopolized all the powers. Religious power was associated with authority in civic and legal matters, since the Jews did not distinguish between religious legislation and the rest. 

## Disciplinary acts

When a member refused to submit to the prevailing religious legal order, and after several warnings, the elders, after deliberation, decided on excommunication or exclusion from the congregation. Although it should be noted that there were two types: 

- the _nidduy_ or _sammatta_, or temporary exclusion, with the possibility of readmission; 

- the _herem_, or perpetual excommunication. 

In any case it only represented a social exclusion, not a physical punishment. The person was forever marked under suspicion, and it was normal for them to be socially marginalized, which forced the person to leave their place of origin and change their residence frequently. It also prevented him from entering the synagogue. But for a Jew this represented the worst punishment.

This allows us to better understand the passages in the Gospels where Jesus is shown inadvertently exchanging Capernaum for Tire and Sidon (Mk 7:24), probably because of his excommunication, which curiously is never mentioned in the Gospels (but is in [UB 154:2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p2)). She is mentioned, yes, as an action against his disciples, _aphorizein_ in Lk 6:22 and _aposynagogon poiein_ or _ginesthai_ (Jn 9: 22,12: 42,16: 2). 

## The building 

It was called _bet keneset_ (_byt hknst_) in Aramaic, _synagogé_ and _proseuché_ in Greek, especially the latter (translated as “gathering house”). Other less common designations were _proseuchterion_ and _sabbatherion_. 

Schurer tells us about its location:

> Synagogues were preferably built outside of cities and near a riverbank or seaside, so that everyone could perform the prescribed ablution before taking part in worship. 

Although there is no indication of this custom in the rabbinic literature and there is in other sources, what the rabbis did remember to mention is the custom of being built on the highest point of the cities. It seems that in the event that both customs entered into conflict, the proximity to the water prevailed (such was the case of the synagogue that is currently preserved in the ruins of Capernaum, which is close to Lake Tiberias), or two were built. synagogues (as in Giscala, where there are remains of a synagogue on top of a hill and another at its foot, near a spring).

The only two synagogue ruins that reliably date from the time of Jesus are Masada and Herodium. The others are almost all later than the third century AD, and they do not help us to form an exact idea of ​​what they were like in the time of Jesus (for example, the synagogue that can be admired today in the ruins of Capernaum is dated in the last decade of the 4th century AD and the middle of the 5th century AD, a long time since the time of Jesus, which makes it highly unlikely that it was the one the Master knew). Therefore, we will better examine the two cases that we have to form an idea of ​​what these buildings were like at the time that concerns us.

The Masada Synagogue, in its original form, was a 15m x 12m rectangle with two rows of columns. The floor was gray plaster. The entrance was in the east wall; the main room was reached through an atrium. Then the Zealots made modifications. 

The Herodium synagogue was similar, although it seemed to have less of a religious purpose, given its location. 

The honorary seat, undoubtedly intended for the president of the synagogue, was known as the “seat or chair of Moses” (in Aramaic _qtdr dmst_, in Greek _Moyseos cháthedra_). In the one found in the synagogue of Hammat, near Tiberides, an inscription in Aramaic was engraved commemorating one of the benefactors.

Certain architectural elements cannot be considered typical of the time of Jesus, such as a niche in the wall facing Jerusalem to store the Torah scrolls, or the basilica plan facing the holy city with an ark to deposit the Torah in the middle . 

We have references to constructive elements that were part of the synagogues: _exedra_, _pronaos_, _períbolos_ (it contained dedicatory inscriptions and votive offerings, just like in the atrium of the temple in Jerusalem), _ypaithroy_, a fountain, a patio, a dining room and porches. But it remains to be seen whether much or little of this was part of the typical synagogue of Jesus' time.

What does seem certain is that at that time there was a strict prohibition of making figurative representations, whether of animals or people, in whole or in part. The ornamentation, therefore, had to be scarce, being limited to the representation of the static symbols of the Jewish world (_menorah_ or candelabra with seven arms, _sofar_ or calling horn, _lulab_ or bouquets of the day of the Shops, _etrog_ or forbidden fruit and the _maggen_ David). Only much later did this attitude towards the plastic arts change in the Jewish world. Something that surely was, however, in the mouth of Jesus, during his pilgrimage through the Jewish and foreign synagogues.

Schurer argues, contrary to archaeologists who stress the scarcity of ruins, that the institutional importance of the synagogue must have meant that synagogues existed in all Jewish towns, even the smallest ones. In the big cities, like Jerusalem, Alexandria and Rome, there must have been a few. A fairly reliable number for Jerusalem is seven synagogues. In Alexandria there is talk of several without specifying, then at least two and probably three or four. In Rome a similar number. When there are several, they are usually distinguished by some emblem or representation. In Sepphoris, for example, there is talk of a “synagogue of the vine” (_knyst dgwpn_), and in Rome there must have been several because one is distinguished as the “synagogue of the olive tree” (_synagogé elaias_).

The furniture of ancient synagogues was very simple. The main object was the ark (_tybh_ or _rwn_) in which the Torah scrolls and other holy books were kept. These were wrapped in linen cloth (_mtphwt_) and closed in a case (_tyq_ or _téche_). Although they are only mentioned in later times, it is presumable that they must have had a dais from where the readers and preachers spoke (_bymh_ or _béma_, the tribune), on which a wide lectern was placed to rest the heavy scrolls. Lamps are also mentioned. Some celebrations made use of the symbolism of the lights, so it is not surprising that there were. Horns (_swpwt_), which were blown on New Year's Day, and trumpets (_hswsrwt_), were also used.

# The Sabbath cult 

It was not only the year with its festive calendar that marked the religiosity of Israel against other peoples , but also its weekly Saturday festivity. The Sabbath was celebrated not only in Jerusalem and its temple, but everywhere, anywhere in Palestine and even outside the country.

The Sabbath feast was determined by the Sabbath precept in the Decalogue. It establishes it as a day of rest from work, even for male and female slaves, foreigners and cattle. In [Ex 20:8-11](/en/Bible/Exodus/20#v8) the precept of the Sabbath is based on God's rest after the work of creation. But everything is a priestly elaboration, which presents the Sabbath as the first law received by men and, therefore, as the central point of the entire Law. It was given only to the people of Israel and is the sign of their election and of its difference from other nations. That's why he was on Saturday under special protection. Thus, it was said: “Anyone who works on it must die. Every man who observes him will be sanctified and blessed all his days ». The rabbis of the time, Aware of the importance of the Sabbath, they were very well in charge of preparing writings where they consigned all the questions related to the Sabbath and the sabbatical year. It was said that “merely by observing all Israel, according to the prescription, two Sabbaths, the eternal salvation of the people would immediately begin.” Hence the immense emphasis placed on this matter.

The thousand and one things that were forbidden to do on Saturday came to absolute suffocation. Let's give some examples: 

* You could walk at most a thousand cubits. 
* any type of personal healing or about others. 
* Carrying arms and defending oneself. As a result of the Macabean uprising it became necessary to suppress this prohibition, since the Israelites fell on the battlefield on Saturday for not defending themselves. From then on the principle was reached that the defense of life neutralized the Sabbath; indeed, the Pharisees later expanded this maxim to the effect that “the saving of a human life abolishes the Sabbath.”

Because God's Sabbath was the Holy fundamental precept for Israel, its violation was punished. If this was produced by inadvertence, whoever commits it receives a warning and becomes a debtor of an expiatory sacrifice. When the precept of the Sabbath is broken, despite the witnesses and despite the prior warning, its transgression requires stoning as a penalty, while, when said transgression occurs without witnesses, it results in extermination by the righteous hand of God. .

The Sabbath was announced and separated from the working day by three blasts of the trumpet from the Levites in the temple and from the synagogue guards in the country. Following them, the pious Israelite lit the Sabbath lamp, took off his phylacteries, and put on good clothes, for the Sabbath was to be celebrated as a day of joy. 

Saturday actually began Friday night with a banquet. Two cups correspond to this first festive meal. In it, the blessing of the table and the _Qiddus_, the sanctification formula for Saturday, were pronounced: “Praise be to you, who sanctified the Sabbath day” or “Praise be to you, who gave Saturdays for rest to your people in love and as a sign of alliance. Praise be to you who sanctified the Sabbath.”

It was also celebrated on Saturday itself with special banquets. Of course, the food had to be prepared the day before, since the acquisition and preparation of food fell within the prohibition of working on Saturday. The main meal took place after noon, and guests were invited to it and fed lavishly. When preparing the food, it was also necessary to think of the needy travelers who, detained for the Sabbath, were forced to remain in one place.

During the festivity of the day it was forbidden to fast, since it had to be a day of jubilation. At its beginning and at its end, it was separated from the working day by means of the so-called _Haggadá_, the separation formula, pronounced at dinner on Saturday; It is not preserved how it was, but it could be something like this: “Praise be to you, who separates the holy from the profane, the seventh day of the six days of work.” 

The divine service of the temple required additional offerings on the Sabbath; the unleavened breads were renewed and the censers were placed on the table of those breads. The priestly shifts alternated in service during the day. The ninety-second psalm was the Sabbath in the temple.

The development of the divine service of the synagogue is in the closest connection with the feast of the Sabbath. This form of assembly and divine worship developed in exile, where the remoteness of the destroyed temple forced meetings without worship around the Law and the history of the people. He effectively contributed to making piety something personal and intimate. 

The inhabitants of the locality met on Saturday morning. The seats, which were few, were distributed according to a certain order, with the most distinguished members of the community in the first rows and the young people behind. Men were also separated according to their different trades. Lepers and women were to stay in separate annexes from the main room. There needed to be at least ten people for the celebration to take place.

The divine service of the synagogue in the morning (along with it there is also the divine service in the afternoon and the weekly service on market days, Monday and Thursday, which were fast days for the Pharisees) consists of a liturgical part and another doctrinal. 

## Liturgical part 

Its fixed elements are: 

- A first prayer, as follows: 

> «Blessed be the Lord, King of the world, creator of light and darkness, maker of peace, creator of all; who in his mercy gives light to the earth and to those who dwell therein; that in his goodness renews day after day and every day, the works of creation. Blessed be the Lord our God for the glory of his works and for the lights that illuminate what he has done to his praise. Sela. Blessed be the Lord our God, maker of light."

- After a short pause, a second prayer was recited: 

> «With great love the Lord our God has loved us, and with overflowing mercy has pitied us, our Father and our King, for love of our fathers who trusted in him. You taught them the statutes of life. Have mercy on us and teach us. Enlighten our eyes in the Law; make our hearts comply with your commandments; unite our hearts so that we love you and fear your name, and we will not be ashamed, world without end. For you are the God of salvation, and you have chosen us out of all nations and all tongues, and you have truly brought us close to your great name, Shelah, so that we can praise your unity with love. Blessed be the Lord, who in love chose his people Israel for him.

- Next came the Shema Yisrael (Hear Israel), the Jewish creed, recited in chorus by the seated community, with their blessings. This rite consisted of the repetition of numerous passages of the Law and indicated that the believers accepted the yoke of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the yoke of the commandments, both day and night. It consisted of Deut 6:4-9,11:13-21; and Num 15:37-41, preceded and followed by one or two blessings. The Shema had to be recited by any Jew at least twice a day, once in the morning and once in the evening. Children, women and slaves were exempt. The people prayed with their faces turned to the Holy of Holies, towards Jerusalem. This is the translation extracted from the Nácar-Colunga Bible:

> Hey, Israel: Yahweh is our God, Yahweh is unique. You will love Yahweh, your God, with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your power, and you will carry deep inside your heart all these commandments, which I am giving you today. Inculcate them in your children, and when you are at home, when you travel, when you go to bed, when you get up, always talk about them. Tie them to your hands, so that they serve you as a sign; put them on your forehead, between your eyes; write them on the posts of your house and on your doors.

> If you obey the commandments that I prescribe for you, loving Yahweh your God, and serving him with all your heart and with all your soul, I will give your land rain in due season, early and late; and you will reap your wheat, your must and your oil; I will also give grass to your fields for your cattle, and from them you will eat and be satisfied. But take great care that your heart does not allow itself to be seduced and, turning aside, you serve other gods and prostrate yourself before them; for Yahweh's anger would burn against you and it would shut up the sky, and there would be no more rain, and the earth would no longer bear fruit, and you would quickly disappear from the good land that Yahweh gives you. Put, therefore, in your heart and in your soul the words that I say to you; tie them as a memory to your hands and put them as a frontal between your eyes. Show them to your children, talk to them about them: when you are at home, when you go on a trip, when you go to bed and when you get up. Write them on the posts of your house and on your doors, so that your days and the days of your children, on the land that Yahweh swore to give them to your fathers, may be as numerous as the days of heaven on earth.

> Yahweh spoke to Moses saying: Speak to the children of Israel and tell them from generation to generation to make fringes on the edges of their robes and tie the fringes of each edge with a hyacinth-colored cord, so that it will serve them , when they see it, to remember all the commandments of Yahweh; so that they put into practice, without following the desires of their hearts and their eyes, those who prostitute themselves; because in this way, remembering my precepts and putting them into practice, you will be holy to your God. I am Yahweh your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I, Yahweh, your God. 

- Then followed a third prayer, the Tefillah:

> «It is true that you are Yahweh, our God and the God of our fathers, our King and the King of our fathers; our Savior and the Savior of our fathers; our Creator and the rock of our salvation; our help and our deliverer. Your name is from everlasting, and there is no other god but you. They sang a new song to those who were released and sang it on the seashore praising your name; together they praised you and recognized you as King and said: 'Yahweh will reign, world without end'. Blessed is the Lord who saves Israel."

- Next came the prayer of the eighteen eulogies, blessings, or supplications (_berakot_): that is, the_ Schemone Esreh_, along with the prayer of the Qaddis, as well as the Aaronite blessing interspersed between blessings 17 and 18. If possible it was pronounced by a priest, who during the blessing symbolically represented the presence of God, standing before the case containing the Torah scrolls, and limiting the congregation to pronouncing certain responses, especially the amen. This part could be shortened, because of its length, to a few blessings, to give more time to the next part, in which the speech was made. The _Schemone Esreh_ was to be recited by every pious Jew three times a day, in the morning, in the early afternoon (when the _minhah_ offering was made) and at sunset.

1. Blessed are you, Lord, the God of our fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob, the great, powerful and terrible God, the Most High God who created heaven and earth, our shield and the shield of our fathers, our support in every generation. Blessed are you, Lord, shield of Abraham. 
2. You are powerful and humble the proud, strong and judge the violent, live forever and raise the dead, make the wind blow and send the dew, give sustenance to the living and make the dead live; in a moment you make our salvation sprout. Blessed are you, Lord, who makes the dead live. 
3. You are holy and terrible is your Name, and next to you there is no other God. Blessed are you, Lord, the Holy God.
4. Grant us, Father, the knowledge that comes from you and the understanding and discernment that come from your Torah. Blessed are you, Lord, who bestows knowledge. 
5. Bring us back to you, Lord, and we will repent. Renew our days as of old. Blessed are you who delight in repentance. 
6. Forgive us, our Father, for we have sinned against you. Blot out and separate from us our evil deeds from before your eyes. Because many are your mercies. Blessed are you, Lord, rich in forgiveness. 
7. Look at our affliction and defend our cause and redeem us for your Name. Blessed are you, Lord, Redeemer of Israel.
8. Heal us, Lord our God, from the pain of our hearts, remove sadness from us and cause the healing of our wounds. Blessed are you who heals the sick of your people Israel. 
9. Bless us this year, Lord our God, and make all its fruits prosper. Hasten the coming of the year of our redemption and grant dew and rain to the earth, and fill the world with the treasures of your goodness, and bless the work of our hands. Blessed are you, Lord, who blesses the years. 
10. Proclaim our liberation with the great trumpet and raise a flag to gather our scattered ones. Blessed are you, Lord, who gathers the exiles of your people Israel.
11. Restore our judges as in ancient times and our counselors as in the beginning, and reign over us alone. Blessed are you, Lord, who loves judgment. 
12. And may there be no hope for apostates, and may the insolent kingdom soon be eradicated, in our days. And may the heretics soon perish, and may they be erased from the Book of Life, and may they not be registered with the righteous. Blessed are you, Lord, who humiliates the insolent. 
13. Rain down your mercies on the righteous proselytes, and grant us a rich reward, together with those who are pleasing to you. Blessed are you, Lord, supporter of the righteous.
14. Be merciful, Lord our God, with your great mercies towards Israel your people and towards Jerusalem your city, and towards Zion, the abode of your glory, and towards your temple and your habitation, and for the royalty of the house of David, your righteous Messiah. Blessed are you, Lord, God of David, who builds Jerusalem. 
15. Hear, Lord our God, the voice of our prayer and have mercy on us, for you are a God of grace and mercy. Blessed are you, Lord, who hears the prayer. 
16. May it please you, Lord our God, to dwell in Zion, and that your servants serve you in Jerusalem. Blessed are you, Lord, whom we worship with fear.
17. We praise you, Lord our God and of our fathers, for all the goodness and grace and favors that you have bestowed on us and that you have done to us and to our fathers before us. And if we say that our feet slip, your grace, O Lord, help us. Blessed are you, Lord, the Most Gracious, you are to be praised. 
18. Pour out your peace on Israel, your people, and on your city and on your inheritance, and bless us all. Blessed are you, Lord, who makes peace. 

## doctrinal part

It took place with the reading aloud of the Torah and the Prophets, as well as a sermon. The reading of the Torah or Pentateuch was carried out in Palestine in a successive cycle of three years, in which passages related to the current moment of the festival calendar of the temple were read during the various festivals and the preparatory periods of the same. This yielded one hundred and fifty-four sections to read on each Sabbath, although there could be other layouts as well. The relevant passages were given the name _Paras_ or _Parasah_. They were read by a number of readers previously chosen by the community, or by a single person, and translated into Aramaic for those who no longer knew Hebrew by a translator, usually the same one who read; this translation was called _Targum_. The reading of the prophets (_Nebiyim_) came at the end, and it was called _Haftará_ or «farewell recitation», because it ended the divine service. It was read on Saturday morning and in the offices of the great festivities; it was freely chosen, but it had to accommodate itself to the lesson of the Torah and explain and summarize it in a certain way. When the boy reached religious majority, at thirteen years of age, he could act for the first time as a reader and was employed as such; for this he was consecrated as _bar mistwá_ or «son of obligation». The act of removing the Torah scroll from the shelf where it was kept, as well as unrolling it and returning it to its shelf, were accompanied by solemn rites. but he had to accommodate himself to the lesson of the Torah and explain and summarize it in a certain way.

The _Haftará_ was followed by a preaching (_darash_), consisting of a brief doctrinal and comforting discourse, normally carried out by the same person who did the readings, the preacher or _darsan_, standing on a dais or _exedra_. 

He ended the service with a blessing pronounced by a priest (Numbers 6: 22ff), to which the assembly responded with an amen. It was like this: «May Yahweh bless you and keep you; let him make his face shine upon you and grant you grace from it; May her face return to you and give you peace ». If there was no priest then the hazan simply recited it.

This was the order that was followed for the morning office, but in the afternoon, the people would gather again in the synagogue, at the time of the minhah sacrifice. The difference here is that there was no reading of the Prophets. There were also services on Mondays and Thursdays, on New Moon days and on holidays. They all followed the same pattern.

# Jewish schools Jewish 

children, around the age of seven (tynwqwt) already begin a regular education by attending elementary school (byt hspr, bet hasepher).

The minister of the congregation who taught the children was the hzn (hazán or chazán), and he could not be a single man. [Jesus, therefore, could never act as such and therefore his teaching to children and young people was always carried out in the family environment.] 

The only subject of this teaching was learning to read, especially focused on reading the Bible. Torá, that is to say, the mqr or miqrá or written Torá. The oral Torah or misnah was part of a higher education.

Along with the theoretical education (memorized learning of the passages and recitation), there was also a practical education regarding religious observance. Although the children were dispensed, it was a common custom to inculcate from children the sabbatical rest, fasting on the Day of Atonement, the Feast of Tabernacles (they were obliged to this feast) and daily prayers (Semoneh Esreh and the actions of thanks before eating). 

Upon reaching the age of thirteen, the child was already considered bar-miswah and reached the age of majority, which gave him the right to attend all religious acts and read in the synagogue. 

All of the above, as you can imagine, was only valid for boys. Girls were excluded from education.

# The cult of the temples 

# The daily life of Jewish law 

# A typical Jewish wedding 

The ancient customs of Jewish weddings are quite difficult to determine, according to experts. We only have scattered and fragmentary references that prevent us from configuring a complete vision. Furthermore, customs varied from one Jewish district to another. 

This is confirmed by Joachim Jeremías in his book _The parables of Jesus_:

> The misconception has arisen because we do not have a description of a wedding party connected to the time of Jesus, but modern collections of material that attempt to build a connected mosaic apart from the scattered allusions found in rabbinic literature. There is evidence that these collections of material are incomplete. This is not surprising in view of the situation regarding sources; the material is limited and widely scattered, and the image is extraordinarily varied; then and now, wedding customs differed from district to district; moreover, after the destruction of the temple, under the repeated impact of national disasters, the Jews suffered great restrictions; but above all, the occasional reports we do have are widely distributed in space and time:

Keeping these limitations in mind, we will try to summarize the typical process of a wedding of that time. 

The young suitor used to go to the house of the bride's father carrying a large sum of money, a betrothal contract, called a shitre erusin (drawn up by the authorities and paid for by the future groom), and a wine skin.

As soon as a young man entered a house carrying these things, you already knew what he was coming for. Then the suitor discussed with the father of the girl and with the older brothers the agreed price to be able to marry his daughter. The cost used to be at least two hundred denarii for a maiden and a hundred denarii for a widow, while the Jerusalem priestly council set four hundred denarii for marrying a priest's daughter. Of course, these figures indicate only the legal minimum, and could be increased at will. If the father finally agreed, he drank a glass of wine with the suitor, and the daughter was invited to come in. If the daughter agreed (she would rarely object to a prior agreement of the father), then there was an agreement, and the daughter and the suitor sealed their betrothal agreement by drinking from the same cup of wine,

From that moment and until twelve months later the betrothal took place. The time of the beginning of the betrothal was marked with a wedding gift (or _mohar_, [Gn 34:12](/en/Bible/Genesis/34#v12), [Ex 22:17](/en/Bible/Exodus /22#v17), 1 Sam 18:25). From the moment of the betrothal, the bride was treated as if she were really married. The union could not be dissolved except by legal divorce; breach of fidelity was treated as adultery; and the woman's property virtually became her husband's, unless she expressly renounced it (Kidd. IX: 1). But even in this case he was the natural heir.

After the betrothal contract, the bride and groom continued to separate each one in their parents' house. During this period the bride prepared herself for her future role as wife and the groom was in charge of finding future accommodation for his wife, which could even be a room in the parents' house. 

Finally the day of the wedding (_nissuin_) arrived. Alfred Edersheim, in his _Sketches of Jewish Social Life_, tells us more details:

> The marriage continued after [the betrothal] after a more or less long period, the limits of which were fixed by law. The ceremony itself consisted of leading the bride to the groom's house, with certain formalities, most dating back to ancient times. Marriage with a maiden was commonly celebrated on a Wednesday afternoon, which left the first days of the week for preparations, and enabled the husband, if he had any accusation against his fiancée's supposed chastity, to make it immediately. before the local Sanhedrin, which met every Thursday. On the other hand, marriage to a widow was celebrated on a Thursday afternoon, which left three days of the week “to rejoice with her.”

The processions prior to the ceremony were an important part of the ritual, as described by Joachim Jeremias: 

> In the late afternoon the guests were entertained at the bride's house. After hours of waiting for the groom, whose arrival was repeatedly heralded by messengers, he finally arrived, half an hour before midnight, to meet the bride; he was accompanied by her friends; illuminated by the flames of the candles, he was received by the guests who had come to meet him. The wedding party then moved, again amidst many luminaries, in a festive procession to the house of the groom's father, where the marriage ceremony and entertainment took place. 

Following on from Edersheim, he comments on several passages:

> In Judea there were two friends of the groom at every wedding. Before marriage, they act as intermediaries between the couple; at the wedding they offer gifts, assist the bride and groom and serve them in the bridal room, also being the guarantors of the bride's virginity. 
> 
> With a blessing, preceded by a brief formula, with which the bride was given to her husband (_Tobías_ VII 13), the wedding festivities began. The couple was then led to the nuptial room (_cheder_) and the nuptial bed (_chuppah_). The bride was already with her hair uncovered. 
>
> The custom of the bridal veil, whether for the bride alone or spread over the couple, dates back to ancient times. It was suppressed for a time by the rabbis after the destruction of Jerusalem. Even older was the wearing of crowns (Cant 3:11, Is 61:10, Ez 16:12), which was also prohibited after the last Jewish war. Palms and myrtle branches were carried in front of the couple, grain or coins were thrown on them, and music preceded the procession, to which it was a religious obligation to join if someone met her. The parable of the ten virgins, who with their lamps, were waiting for the arrival of the bridegroom (Mt 25:1), is based on a Jewish custom. For, according to rabbinical authorities, such lamps supported by canes were in frequent use, ten being the number always mentioned in connection with public solemnities. The marriage festivities lasted a week, but the wedding days lasted for a whole month.

Prior to the wedding, the bride had to properly purify herself in a _miqwaoth_ or ritual bath. On her part, the groom had to prepare the nuptial room or _chuppah_. 

The ceremony, called _kiddushin_, involved making a second contract or _kethubah_. In this contract, the so-called “friends of the groom” were available, two special witnesses who were responsible for attending to the needs of the couple. After signing these witnesses, the contract was taken to the bride's parents. The contract contained the promises that the groom undertook to carry out with his future wife. 

After the ceremony, the bride and groom retired to their nuptial room, which the groom had previously prepared, or _cheder_, where a conjugal bed or _chuppah_ would be available. Here the groom gave gifts to the bride.

For a week (although surely in certain districts this custom was shortened to a few hours so as not to lengthen the wait for the guests too much) the bride and groom remained in the bridal chamber all the time, watched over by the “two friends of the groom”. When the groom finally gives a voice, the friends enter and leave with the good news of the consummation of the marriage. At that moment the bride and groom come out of the _cheder_, when the bride is seen for the first time with her veil (_badecken_) uncovered.

This fact is received with great joy by the guests, which began the wedding party, where food was served, people danced and sang to the sound of music (Ps 45:1-17). Meals required the use of a large quantity of water to carry out the frequent ablutions and ritual washings. The party lasted a whole week, at the end of which all the guests returned to their homes.

I have used all this information to form an idea of ​​what weddings were like in the time of Jesus and use it in the description of the events of the wedding at Cana. It is significant and worth noting here that Jesus very often used wedding customs as examples for his parables. It seems that Jesus enjoyed these social events, as he used them in several of his speeches (Mt 25:1-13, Mt 24:45-51, Lk 12:35-48, Lk 5:33-35, Jn 3:26-30). Examples drawn from wedding customs were so frequently used by the Master that almost more data on these customs can be obtained from the Gospels than from many rabbinical treatises that were written later.

# Foreign religions in the time of Jesus 

## Popular beliefs

In popular beliefs, a set of things are grouped, such as the belief in healing gods and thaumaturgical men, in magic, in astrology, in divination and in the cult of heroes and the dead. These forms of popular beliefs are closely intertwined with each other in multiple aspects, the transitions between one and the other (as are the mysteries) normally fluctuating. Given the superabundance of materials, only essential features can be highlighted. 

### 1. Healing gods and thaumaturgical men 

#### a) Asclepius

No healing god of the ancient world had the renown and success of Asclepius. His fame lasted from the end of the 5th century BC to the 3rd century AD However, he had his predecessors. On the Petsofa hill in eastern Crete, excavations have revealed representations of human limbs consecrated to a salutary divinity. They come from the middle Minoan period (ca. 1600 BC). Another sanctuary comparable to this one, somewhat more recent, was found in the center of the island, on Mount Jukta. These are the oldest “places of grace” in the Mediterranean world. When there was no salutary divinity in the vicinity, people used to turn in primitive times to the salutary heroes associated with the locality. As such they appear in the Attica Amino, Aristomachus, Amphiaraus, and the anonymous Heros Iatros. Representations of the cured limbs and votive tablets are also consecrated to them. Subsequently, Asclepius pushed these healthy heroes into the background. It is significant that Sophocles received, as priest of Amino, the new god Asclepius. However, Asclepius did not inherit his function as a salutary divinity from the salutary heroes, but from Apollo, who was originally the holder of the art of healing in ancient Greek religion.

Originally, Asclepius was worshiped in Trica of Thessaly as a chthonic divinity in the form of a serpent. From there he arrived as a healing hero with the symbol of the serpent (with the support presumably of the priests of Apollo at Delphi) in the 6th century BC near the small Argive town of Epidaurus in the Peloponnese. Surprising miracles must have cemented his fame in that locality very soon. In any case, at the beginning of the 4th century, extensive construction activity took place there. Correlatively, the old Thessalonian legend of his birth was modified: Asclepius, son of Apollo and Coronis (or Aigla), saw the light in the temple itself and, as a child, operated in Epidaurus cures of the sick and resurrection of the dead. The most important figure that appears next to him is Hygieia. To the two sons of Asclepius, Macaón and Podalirio, traced back the lineage of the Aclepiads. The success of Epidaurus led to the early development of offshoots of the cult, sometimes bringing together a whole pantheon of divinities.

In the year 420 BC Asclepius had already penetrated into Athens, where a sanctuary was built for him on the southern slope of the Acropolis. His prestige was so great that his festivals, the Epidaurias, were fixed on an intermediate day of the main festival of Eleusis. In eastern Greece, shrines to him on the island of Kos and in Pergamum became famous. Cos, however, occupies a special situation. The narrations of miracles are completely missing from it and it became known, on the contrary, as the seat of the Asclepiad medical school, which ostensibly has nothing to do with Epidaurus. Finally, in the year 293 BC, the cult of Asclepius also arrived in Rome, where a filial sanctuary was erected to him on the Tiber Island. In the cult of this healing divinity, frequently designated by the epithet of Sotér, hymns to Asclepius played a great part. His enormous success shows clearly how little faith the people already had in the gods of the old beliefs.

The salutary activity that was attributed to Asclepius can be studied very well in the numerous accounts of healings that the priests of Epidaurus had inscribed at the end of the fourth century BC on large tombstones. Three stelae and fragments of a fourth with seventy accounts in total have been preserved from these tombstones, placed inside the temple enclosure for the pilgrims' construction. According to them, the main healing procedure was to sleep in the temple of the god, the so-called incubation. For this purpose, large posts had been arranged. In them, the patient dreamed of the most incredible medical interventions or the admonitions of Asclepius, to leave there cured the next day. The god healed in this way supposedly blind, crippled, dropsical and mute; he remedied stone disease, abscesses, suppurations, worms and labor pains; he fulfilled the desire to have offspring and gave instructions in his dream oracle to recover lost objects. As mediating elements, salutary water from a spring and the sacred serpent are repeatedly mentioned. As for the operations, Asclepio carried out interventions that contemporary experimental medicine did not yet dare to carry out; for example, the opening of the intestinal cavity. Divine surgery sometimes reached grotesque limits, such as cutting off the head of a dropsy and putting it back in place, once all the liquid had been expelled. The secondary cures operated outside the temple must have served as consolation for the not insignificant number of faithful who left without result. he made the desire to have offspring come true and gave instructions in his dream oracle to recover lost objects.

For the critical judgment of the stories of healings, the chronological separation between the real incubations and their epigraphic testimony must be taken into account. The first miracle in the series clearly indicates the reworking of the text of the stories written on the wooden votive tablets, before being reproduced on the stelae. While the votive tablet merely indicates that a woman named Cleo was cured by Asclepius, after having carried “a weight” on her body for five years, the stele speaks of a five-year pregnancy and the birth of a four-year-old child. years, that as soon as he was born he could run around. The pious exaggerations on the part of the healed and the priests presuppose, however, on their part, factual knowledge of a certain number of indisputable miracles. Naturally, faith was required of the sick, but not so much faith in their own healing as in the reality of the healings referred to in the stelae. As can be understood, the most important requirement for healing was to eliminate the slightest spark of disbelief. The beneficiary of a cure naturally had to pay a kind of fee to the temple. At his mercy, Asclepius contented himself with the humblest gifts, whether they were a child's ten balls or cheap terra-cotta reproductions of healed body parts. Well-to-do people chose, understandably, a valuable material (marble, silver, gold) or had the healing scene depicted in bas-relief. There were also offerings of gold, animals and fruits. but not so much faith in the healing itself as in the reality of the healings referred to in the stelae.

Hasta qué punto podía la devoción a Asclepio determinar la vida entera de un hombre, lo enseña el ejemplo del retor Arístides (nacido en el 117 d.C.). Tras una larga estancia en el Asklepieion de Pérgamo, que estaba en pleno auge en el siglo II d.C., se curó de una enfermedad que le había durado diecisiete años, y desde entonces se convirtió en un fanático devoto del dios. A las anotaciones de su diario terapéutico les dio forma literaria en los Discursos sagrados. No se arredraba ni ante las terapias más extrañas, como, por ejemplo, un baño en agua helada en el invierno, y se sentía unido a diario con el dios en sus ensueños. Hasta el final de su vida conservó una fe pueril en él y llegó a celebrarle en uno de sus útimos discursos como dios supremo, como Zeus Asclepio. Otro devoto de Asclepio, el médico milesio Nicias, hacía a diario una ofrenda de humo ante la imagen de dios que tenía en casa. E, inversamente, tampoco faltaban, como es natural, las befas. Aristófanes presenta en el Plutos una descrip-ción burlesca de la incubación. Plutarco se divirtió plantando en broma la pregunta de si Aclepio podría prescribir también a un judío carne de cerdo. Diógenes el Cínico (o el ateo Diagoras de Melos), ante las múltiples tablas votivas del santuario de los «Grandes dioses» de Samotracia, comentó que «habría todavía muchas más si los no curados hubieran consagrado tablillas».

#### b) Otros dioses salutíferos: Isis y Sarapis

Along with Asclepius, due to their relative importance, they only deserve to be mentioned as saluting gods Isis and Sarapis. Isis also helped the sick through oneiric admonitions, so that, if they obeyed the goddess, they were cured paradoxically. Many of her, with whom the art of the physicians failed, owed her salvation to her. The child Horos learned the íatrikhé and the mantikhé from his mother and became a benefactor of humanity for his Khrésmoí and his Serapeíai. Above all, the salutary oracle of Isis in Menuthis was famous, which was later ruled (since Cyril) by the Christian martyrs Cyrus and John. To Sarapis he composed in her youth that Arisitides, mentioned before, a prose hymn in thanksgiving for having saved him from the perils of the sea. Unfortunately, Very little of the abundant inscriptions and literary documents known in antiquity have been preserved. In the sanctuary of Sarapis, in Canopos, some wrote down the Serapeíai, the miraculous cures achieved, and others the áretaí logion, the salutary oracles received during incubation. Among the staff remainsBefore the temples of Isis and Sarapis there were interpreters of salutary dreams. Artemiodoro still had news of aretalogos who had registered in three, five and up to twenty-two books the dreams and healings granted by Asclepius. Some íámata have gone from the literature of the temples to Aeliano's Historia de los animas. Thus, eg, a horseman named Lenaeus leads his horse, who had gone blind, to the Sarapeion, where the god prescribes a cure for him. One gets the impression that Sarapis was credited with no fewer miracles than Asclepius. 

#### c) Statues and healing images

Since ancient man believed that the divinity was present in his earthly representations, it was logical that he also attributed miraculous healings and similar events to the images of the gods and the statues of the heroes. in doing so, he was adhering to the principle that the god who wounds can also heal. In the 2nd century AD, the emissaries of the plague-stricken cities received instructions from the oracle of Apollo of Claros to place the image of the god as “expeller” at the city gate. Similarly it was estimated in Rome that salvation from the plague was due to the erection of images of the Dioscuri, who were worshiped as healing gods.

When the Neoplatonist Plutarch sought help from Asclepius, he naturally expected it from the image of the god. Pausanias mentions that there was a klíne to the right of the cult image in the Asklepieion of Tithorea. That is why it is understandable that the divinity frequently appeared in dreams to the sick in the form of his statue. The scientific oneirocrisis of an Artemidorus expressly referred the appearance of the image of the god to the appearance of the god himself. Healthful effects were also produced by the statues of the heroes. in the Philopseudes, a dialogue by Lucian, Eucrates refers to the miraculous virtues of the statutory portrait of the Corinthian general Pelicus. He had cured him personally of a bout of fever and had also lent his help to others who were in the same situation. For those he had it adorned with crowns, silver coins and votive tablets. But the statue could also take revenge on those who belittled it. Last night he made a slave who stole his offerings run from here to there and beat him every night until he died. Luciano also had news of a statuette of Hippocrates that was walking around the house at night and causing annoyance when he did not receive offerings. The image of Heros Iatros was also attributed cures for fevers. To the image of the hero Protesilaus, who also healed the sick, people beat her prayers and anointed her, to the extent that she was completely worn out for it. To what extent the belief in miracles could be attached to a particular statue is shown by the notocia of Athenagoras, according to which, among many other existing statues in the Toróade de Nerilino, only one gave oracles and healed the sick. Like the Pelico statue, he had it crowned and covered in gold for it. Athenagoras groups Nerilino, an otherwise unknown character, with Alexander of Abonutico and Pilgrim Proteus. It never occurs to the Christian apologist to question the miracles of these three characters, and he explains them, in the Christian manner, as operations of demons. He also reported miraculous healings from statues of famous athletes. Moreover, there was even the conviction that certain statues were capable of giving certain manifestations of life: laughing, speaking, closing their eyes so as not to see any sacrilege or not to look at their viewer, sweat, move, turn their back, etc. .

#### d) Thaumaturges 

The ancients not only attributed to the gods and deified heroes qualities and abilities that surpassed human measure, but also to certain outstanding personalities, who already stood out for their admirable gifts in life. Very soon the notion of Seíos anér (or something similar) was coined for them.

As Seíoi have always been the seers, the diviners, the priests of the oracles, the ministers of expiatory rites, the magicians and miracle workers, the prophets and singers, the chiefs and kings, the founders of cities and of States and the legislators. lators of times past. Among the divinely born heroes and operators of great profits, the most prominent and often mentioned was the son of Zeus, Heracles. Luciano calls him Seios anér and Seós. And for Plato the philosopher is the model of the Seios and of the enthoysiazon. The Stoa reserved the notion of 'divine man' exclusively for the 'wise'. These are, Zeno explains, the only true priests and seers, because they are agnoi. Above evil and all calamity, the sage walks the earth as a godlike being.

Along with those already mentioned, there are other names in which the old popular notion of Seios anér is still perceived. They made their appearance as Seioi in a conscious way and left behind a copious legend in lore. Certain typical features are repeated in them. His prototype is Pythagoras, whose birth was put in connection with Apollo. His activity as teacher and miracle worker began once he was initiated into all the mysteries of Greece and the East. Everyone just called him Seois. He followed a sacred diet, wore sacred clothes and performed miracles. Empedocles was considered a disciple of the divine Pythagoras. As his teacher, he wore a special dress and was at the same time a philosopher, a politician and a thaumaturge. His salvation of a woman who had lain for thirty days breathless and without a pulse was famous. In his Physika he left written evidence of his healing and thaumaturgical arts. Even the wind and rain obeyed him. People addressed prayers to him as to a god after he had unsuccessfully suppressed the evil emanations of a river. Moreover, he had no qualms about calling himself an “immortal god” and speaking of his divine worship. There were thousands who went to seek in this divine doctor and thaumaturge supposed advice to cure themselves of illness and pain. Missing in his case is a legend for his birth; but, instead, the end of him is wrapped in a mystical darkness. Among the various legends relating to him, the best known is that of his precipitation on Etna. The apotheosis and the abduction are the typical ending of the popular Seios anér. People addressed prayers to him as to a god once he had unsuccessfully suppressed the evil emanations of a river.

Of the same breed as Empedocles was the physician Menecrates of Syracuse. He claimed divine nature and called himself Zeus. His special gifts lay in curing epileptics. Those whom he healed he forced into his retinue and gave them the name and dignity of gods. As Seios khoros they accompanied him on his pilgrimage through the countries.

Chronologically, the closest to early Christianity is Apollonius of Tyana, a contemporary of Paul, whose life Philostratus wrote on behalf of the Empress Julia Domna. It is not without reason that he puts him on an equal footing with Pythagoras and Empedocles. In fact, Apollonius belonged to the current of neopythagoreanism. The oldest tradition saw in him a sorcerer and a magician. Philostratus tried to defend him from this calumny and to present him as daimónios and Seios. In the manner of the sophists, he makes him assimilate in his long journeys the wisdom of the East, of the Brahmins and of the gymnosophists. He is Seios, for possessing power and knowledge similar to that of the gods. As a philosopher, he preached harsh self-discipline, concerned himself with the renovation of temples and with upright divine worship. He admonished the Emperor and the common citizens. Even the birds listened to him from the rooftops. He stresses even more insistently than Pythagoras the abstinence from the sex trade. His divinity is manifested, on the one hand, in the gift of prophetic foresight; on the other, in the ability to heal the sick and resurrect the dead. In Athens he expounded of a young man or demon, who, coming out of it, smashed a statue to pieces; in Rome he resuscitated a newlywed who was already being carried in a coffin through the city. The tradition about his birth and his end is tinged with legends. Her mother gave birth to him when she woke up in a meadow together with swans that sang. At the same moment lightning struck the earth and rose again to the sky. At the end of his life Apollonius had to defend himself in court before the Emperor Domitian in Rome and mysteriously disappeared from the courtroom, to later appear to his friends in Dicearquia, as he had predicted. for forty days she conversed with them and convinced them of the corporeality of his appearance. She then he entered the temple and disappeared, while a triumphant song resounded: «Rise from the earth. take to the sky Get up. “ After this ascent to the heavens, he manifested himself again in a dream to an unbelieving young man to indoctrinate him about immortality. Similarly, Luciano, in his writing on the death of Pilgrim Proteus, had already recounted the end of this phony philosopher. A vulture took flight from the flames of the pyre, exclaiming: ”I leave the earth, I ascend to Olympus." Shortly afterwards an old man saw the philosopher walking in a human figure in a portico. The same notion of ascension to heaven reappears in the Apotheosis of the Emperors,

The most controversial, without a doubt, of all the so-called miracle workers was the pseudo-prophet Alejandro de Abonutico, whom Luciano unmasked in one of his writings as a depraved and trickster. Alexander founded in the second century AD, in his hometown on the west coast of Asia Minor, the cult of the serpent god Glycon, whom he called “the light of men” or “the new Asclepius.” The arctic god of whom he declared himself a prophet soon acquired a large clientele. Alexander presented himself as a mediator, through whose prayers the god helped the supplicants. In one of his oracles, he even declared that the so-called prophet was a reincarnation of Pythagoras. Alexander gave healing oracles, but did not use the rite of incubation. He responded to questions in writing, either he made him answer the god by means of a voice tube (the so-called autophona oracles), or else he answered by virtue of his own oneiric inspirations. He had exegetes who explained, for a fee, the dark oracles, temple servants who extolled the divinity with their hymns, and apostles to deal with propaganda and give appropriate information. Each oracle cost a drachma and two obols. According to Lucian, Alexander must have earned something like seventy or eighty thousand drachmas a year. His fame reached Rome, where he managed to get his hometown changed from Abonutico to Ionopolis (“city of the serpent”). The success of this false prophet throws a very significant light on the religious situation of the first and second centuries. or he responded by virtue of his own dream inspirations.

### 2. The magic

The figure of the Seioi andres introduces us fully to enchantments and magic. Enchantments already existed in classical Greece. A living testimony of this is provided by Plato in his Laws, Theophrastus in his description of the deisidaimon and the author of the writing on the “sacred disease” (epilepsy), perhaps Hippocrates himself. With the Persian Wars, Assyrian-Babylonian magic entered the Greek world. To this were added later Egyptian influences. But magic did not reach its apogee until the Roman imperial age, that is, in the first two centuries of the Christian Era. It reflects the religious insecurity of the masses of this time, who no longer had faith in the help of the ancient gods and took refuge in the magical coercion of gods and demons. Magical practices were codified in thick books of incantations. A fragmentary part of them, preserved in the Greek magical papyri from Egypt, edited and produced by K. Preisendaz, shows that the magic of the late Hellenistic age was a syncretic product. In the innovations appear gods from different countries and cults. Of the ancient Greek popular beliefs, the divinity that especially reappears is Hecate, the spectral queen of the realm of the dead, already fused with the lunar goddess Selene-Artemis in a frequently recurring triad. Even non-Jewish magicians invoke the god of Abraham, Jacob and Isaac and use Hebrew letters and words. But the favorite gods are from the homeland of magic: Egypt. shows that the magic of the late Hellenistic age was a syncretic product.

The old magic rests theoretically on two pillars: the belief in demons and the belief in sympathy. Since ancient times, the Greeks have known a host of ghostly figures with which the Eastern belief in demons could be related, which penetrated Greece from the fourth century. The more inoperative the ancient anthropomorphic gods became, the more the world was filled with daemons. even the ancient gods were degraded to the category of these. Where the importance of belief in daemons is most evident is in the role it has played since Plato in philosophy. The passage from the Syposion is well known, in which Plato describes the mediating function of the daemons between men and the gods and qualifies Eros as a daimonion. his disciple Xenocrates was the first to distinguish expressis verbis between good and bad demons. The Stoa and Neoplatonism made this theory of the demons their own and transmitted it to Neoplatonism, which would make a broad philosophical systematization of it. From then on, popular beliefs saw demonic powers operating throughout the cosmos. The art of magic was not simply about expelling evil demons and making use of good ones. The magical influence on gods, demons and men would be completely impossible if there were not a reciprocal sympathy or antipathy in the entire cosmos. The theory of sympathy, coming ultimately from Babailonia and Assyria, was elaborated and philosophically founded by the Stoa and Neoplatonism. The sympathies and antipathies between the stars, fauna, flora and men were carefully investigated. Pliny's Natural History offers us a veritable mine of data in this regard. The magician is characterized by the exact knowledge of him and by his correct use of the appropriate sympathetic medium for a given case. The connoisseur of the sympathetic environment corresponding to a demon can exert a magical coercion on it; he has in his power the magical dynamis inherent in things. In everything, correct physical and chemical observations are intertwined with the grossest superstitions.

The connoisseur of the sympathetic environment corresponding to a demon can exert a magical coercion on it; he has in his power the magical dynamis inherent in things. In everything, correct physical and chemical observations are intertwined with the grossest superstitions.

As sympathetic means used in magical action, it is necessary to consider, in the first place, the materials that can be obtained from the vegetable, animal and mineral kingdoms. The simultaneous use of various means naturally reinforced the enchantment. Usually, these means were made in the form of ointments, potions, incense, inks, etc. Thus, for example, great use was made of parts of the donkey, such as the skin, the hair, the milk, the dung and the blood. The great role played by this animal in black magic gave rise to the Emperor Valentinian to condemn to death his Secretary of State, Faustino, for having been suspected of having killed an ass to make use of it in secret arts. Faustino, for his part, assured that he had only wanted to prepare a remedy against hair loss. This example shows how close the connection was between magic and magical medicine. Galen, the doctor, complains bitterly about a certain Pamphilus, who described in six volumes the sacred plants with their corresponding magical actions and rituals. The so-called magical papyrus of Paris also provides detailed information on the Egyptian custom of collecting magical plants. A whole literature was also concerned with the marvelous properties of the various precious and semi-precious stones. Among the metals, the preferred ones were iron, copper and lead. Iron was considered hostile to daemons: it broke the spell. Astrology assigned to each planet not only a particular metal, but also a certain animal, a certain plant, and a certain stone. All the planetary gods infused their metals with their demonic forces. That is why the magical papyros always indicate exactly what metal the magical plates on which the magical formulas, names and figures were inscribed should be made. The one who wanted to influence the souls of the dead, that is: those who had died in a violent or premature way, with the intention, for example, of conjuring them up to ask them a question, had to be in possession of any object (oysia) that had been in relation with the deceased. Here, in the first place, the hair, the nails of the fingers and toes and then everything that was in any relation to the death of the individual in question, from the nails with which he was crucified to the bug found at the place of his execution or burial.

To the great quantity of sympathetic materials, an immaterial element had to be added, for the charm to obtain results, namely: the human voice, articulated or inarticulate. It is not possible to imagine enchantment without a certain formula and supplication, especially without the authentic invocation to the divinity or to the demon, with which an irresistible action is exerted on the superior powers. On the one hand, epithets accumulate; on the other hand, «barbarian names» were pronounced, long words consisting of twenty, forty and more letters (the so-called asema onomata), or names were expressed with the numerical value of their letters, speaking then simply of «hidden names» . Invocation in various languages ​​was also used, juxtaposing human and animal language. Employed the correct names and formulas, beings conjured with them appeared even against their will. For this reason, Clement of Alexandria called the daemons, without further ado, doyloi of the magicians. The anecdote of the Jewish magician Eleazar is curious, who, in the presence of Vespasian, with the help of a magic ring, took the demon out of a possessed man's nose, prohibiting him with a magic formula of Solomon from returning to his victim. If the spell did not obtain the desired result by ordinary means, the magician could burst into the most terrible threats against the gods, demons and souls. He took the demon out of the nose of a possessed man, prohibiting him with a magic formula of Solomon from returning to his victim.

He took the demon out of the nose of a possessed man, prohibiting him with a magic formula of Solomon from returning to his victim. If the spell did not obtain the desired result by ordinary means, the magician could burst into the most terrible threats against the gods, demons and souls.

Only after having carried out magical actions was a new magical medium obtained: the statuettes and magical figures that represented the superior beings who were conjured. The magician was understandably interested in retaining with his spell as long as possible the pneuma of god or demon within his image. The Neoplatonists called this theurgy, and wrote a number of books on the subject. A magical papyrus gives, for example, precise indications on how to prepare a figure of Eros, which sends dreams, produces insomnia and expels evil demons. For the penetration of the divinity or the demon into the interior of his image, the recitation of theurgical forms is decisive. Eunapius graphically relates how he made her first smile and then roar with laughter at a cult image of Hecate the theurgist Maximus, presenting him an offering and quietly reciting a formula; later until the torches that the statue had in his hands were lit. Animated images protect above all the country, the city or the temple in which they are found, but they also protect individuals, if they permanently have the statue with them. Sula carried with him a figure of Apollo; Nero, one of the Syrian Dea, who revealed the future to him. Paredroi zeoi of this type were worshiped at home in small chapels. They served especially as dispensers of oracles. Along with the statuettes, the magical papyri also mention drawings in stone, metal or papyrus. The conjured being is present as long as the magician does not erase the drawing. later until the torches that the statue had in its hands were lit.

The conjured being is present as long as the magician does not erase the drawing.

Other magical resources are curse tablets and amulets. On boards of bronze the misfortunes that were wished to a rival in the games or to the opposite part in a process were written. Very instructive are the self-curses with which the people defended themselves against unjustified suspicions. The tablets of the curse were placed in the tombs, which means that the fulfillment of their content was entrusted to the gods and subterranean spirits. Amulets, on the contrary, protected first of all from any possible misfortune. The most frequent motifs in them are those of Egyptian mythology and mysterious epigraphs. A huge number of the motifs of the amulets come from the animal world. In general, These phylakhteria were generally carried on them and it was believed that the demons bowed before them. The Jews also considered as amulets the so-called tephillim, that is, the prayer straps (phylacteries) that they wore on their arms and forehead. Related to the amulets are the so-called telesmata, images that were placed, according to the principle of analogical magic, to ward off certain plagues. The image of the harmful kept harm away. A magician placed images of scorpions in Tripolis to conjure up these animals. Recent tradition especially attributes to Apollonius of Tyana the placement of talismans of this nature. The effect lasted for centuries. Thus, eg, as the storks in Byzantium threw poisonous snakes into a fountain, Apollonius had three marble storks placed in it, which would henceforth keep all storks away from the city. Apollonius conjured up a terrible plague of snakes by drawing an eagle on a stele with a snake in its claws. The represented process attracted to itself the actual process itself.

The development of a magical action was, naturally, strictly regulated. The magician had to personally comply with all kinds of requirements, especially the observance of certain precepts of abstinence and purity. In this the magic coincides almost exactly with the ritual of incubation and the mysteries. Apart from this, strict indications of place and time had to be adhered to. Related to this is the so-called choice of days, that is, the doctrine of favorable and unfavorable days. As for the magical act, it is divided into four parts: the invocation (khlesis), which consisted of a formula or a supplication; the offering (epithyma) to propitiate the demon, the magical action (praxis) itself, that is, the execution of certain magical-symbolic acts, and the farewell (apolysis). The latter was extremely important, since those who did not know how to produce never got rid of the spirits they had invoked, as Luciano describes with great humor. To be complete, every magical precept must contain detailed precisions on these four points. To them also belong the indications on the amulets that the magician has to wear to prevent personal injury.

It is difficult to establish a systematic order in the magical precepts that have been transmitted to us. Taking into account the character of the demons invoked, the intended effects and the means used, the Neoplatonists established a distinction between goetia and theurgy, a distinction that Augustine reproduces. The goetia is addressed to the material daemons, while theurgy claims to influence the higher classes of daemons and gods. Correlatively, a distinction was made between upper and lower means and effects. The vast number of purported magical operations can be divided into four main genres: 1) prophylactic and apotropaic charms; 2) aggressive and harmful; 3) of love and power: 4) of knowledge and revelation. From the sociological point of view, it is the lower strata of the population that are most accessible to magic. In it, ignorance and superstition go hand in hand. Those who risked their lives on a daily basis and also those who lived from day to day and could only hope for a change in their situation through the intervention of superior powers threw themselves into the arms of the magicians. They were legally persecuted, in the first place, the different forms of harmful charms; but those who pursued political interests and were likely to constitute a danger to the State were also punishable. The use of children as magical means also lent itself to obstacles to justice.

Finally, magic is characterized by the way it is conceived as mystery initiation. Knowledge of all the theoretical and practical details important to magic constitutes the notion of magical gnosis. “Gnosis” is, above all, the knowledge of the Name as the highest degree of magical knowledge. The conversion of this gnosis to praxis is often called by the sphyrtors tekhne magiké or, respectively, ars magica. Magical knowledge is a divine gift, only granted to the chosen ones. For this reason it can be called mysterion. Whoever knows its secrets is an initiate, a mystes; he who in turn can initiate others is called mystagogues. The initiation, for its part, is called telete or initiare as the main sacrament of the mysteries. Naturally, magical lore must be kept secret to protect it from abuse and desecration. Properly, it should only be transmitted within the family. The preservation of the secret finally leads, as in the mysteries, to the magician preferring the night for his task, which logically makes him suspect among many people.

### 3. Astrology

Since the time of Alexander the Great, astrology has been progressively displacing, as a spiritual force, the ancient belief in gods and oracles. His elaborate system is a syncretic product, with Chaldean, Egyptian, and Greek roots. From Babylon comes the fundamental conception of the union of each one of the celestial bodies, especially the planets, with a certain god whose properties are attributed to him. Another notion, viz., that celestial phenomena portend or even cause terrestrial events, could be connected with the ancient Greek conviction that weather changes and the like are caused by the stars. His seemingly scientific garb was received by astrology from its union with Greek mathematics and astronomy. Nevertheless, the astrological system did not find its development on Greek soil, but in the Hellenistic Egypt of the time of the Ptolemies. From about 280 BC, Berossus, a Babylonian priest from Bel, had introduced the Chaldean theory of the stars to the Greeks on the island of Cos, but the great book of future astrology was not developed until about 150 BC. BC, in Egypt, in the mystical treatises whose origin was traced back to the Egyptian king Nequepsón and his priest Petosiris. From about the same period is a second book containing the alleged astrological revelations of Hermes Trigemistus. In the following epoch the book market was flooded with an enormous mass of astrological manuals, meteorological calendars and mantic treatises. In the second century AD, astrology was already a favorite topic of philosophical discussions. If Carneades and Panetius declared against him, the whole of philosophy soon declared in his favour, with the exception of the skeptics. According to Pliny, it was the great astronomer Hipparchus of Nicaea who best demonstrated that the stars are related to men and that our souls are part of the sky. The definitive victory of astrology among cultured people was contributed, above all, by the work of the last great Stoic philosopher, the Assyrian Posidonius of Apamea (135-51 BC), who synthesized all the knowledge of his time in a specific image of the world for astrology. In this way, the ground was prepared so that Claudius Ptolemy could compose in the second half of the second century AD the complete work of Greek astrology in his Tetrabiblos syntaxis. soon the whole of philosophy, with the exception of the skeptics, pronounced itself in his favour.

Astrology, which finally prevailed in the imperial era, was not a homogeneous product. The difference between an astrology with a strictly scientific air and a popular astrology always continued to exist. In a general way, astrology was above all an exclusive patrimony of educated people, since it required complicated calculations. The astrologers felt like priests, like initiates in a divine wisdom. They exposed in systematic textbooks the effects of the most important stars. The most decisive of these were the influences of the stars, which appeared at certain degrees from the equator or from the ecliptic. 360 stars and stellar figures were fixed for them, from which the motley system of the gods of degrees, the so-called monomoiriai, was created. According to another point of view, the most important were the so-called deans, that is, star gods who dominated every ten degrees. Later, the stellar destiny was found in the planets and in the figures of the zodiac, whose names and symbols appear in an almost canonical order approx. from the 3rd century AD

Each of the stars was assigned certain spaces of land, periods of time, animals, plants, human limbs, properties, companies and many other things. Between the macrocosm and the microcosm there was, in the beliefs of the astrologers, a universal solidarity, in such a way that it was possible to give an exact prognosis to each project and each event. Cultured astrology fixed the factual state of the sky in each case and inscribed it in the twelve zones of the so-called horoscope or nativity. Predictions that later turned out to be false could easily be excused for a miscalculation. Naturally, an educated prognosis of this kind was an expensive thing that simple people could not afford. The astrological beliefs of the masses were otherwise much simpler. According to Pliny, They consisted of the conviction that each one of us is accompanied by a star, bright for the rich, small for the poor, dark for the weak, which shines according to the destiny of each one. In such a way that each star rises with its man and announces the death of someone when it falls. The astrology of the layman took into account little more than hours, days, months and years, and in the best of cases, also the signs of the zodiac and the moon. But, in the face of this, all kinds of cheap astrologers, oriental for the most part, subsidized the needs of the general public, who sold their predictions, amulets and medicines for little money in the alleys and markets. Cultured people looked at them with contempt. Not in vain there is a lot of astrology in the magical papyri. The mjerío cooperated not a little in the propagation of these pseudo-astrogos. Astrologers of all kinds were pulsing through the private rooms of the empresses. Juvenal scoffs at a distinguished lady who did not leave the house, take food or medicine without first consulting her trivial book of predictions. And all of this ended up in the witches, who made the moon descend in the sky and performed other trivial astrologumena.

The tasks of astrology have been, in part, clarified. The new science at the end of the first century BC took over the function of the oracles, which were rapidly disappearing. The mentality of the time, once again, is Juvenal who describes it: «The oracles at Delphi have already fallen silent and the ignorance of the future weighs heavily on the human race». According to Ptolemy, it is necessary to distinguish between a universal astrology and an individual astrology. The first gives its reports on entire areas of the earth, towns and cities. He is especially interested in natural disasters and wars, but also minor weather forecasts. Individual astrology deals with everything that concerns the human individual. Thanks to his horoscope (nativity), calculated from the hour of his birth, it gives accurate predictions about the constitution of his body and his soul, the length of his life, about his parents and siblings, finances, marriage, children, friends, profession, etc. Also important was the so-called astrology of the katarchai, which helped to discover the appropriate decision in all possible situations, fixing the favorable moment in which it was recommended or discouraged. A highly developed branch of this form of astrology was iatromathematics, which was used to ascertain, based on the position of the stars, the diagnosis of any disease, determine the possibilities of cure and take the necessary medical measures. it was the so-called astrology of the katarchai, which cooperated in discovering the appropriate decision in all possible situations, fixing the favorable moment in which it was advised or discouraged.

A highly developed branch of this form of astrology was iatromathematics, which was used to ascertain, based on the position of the stars, the diagnosis of any disease, determine the possibilities of cure and take the necessary medical measures.

The state's attitude towards astrology was not uniform. According to Diodorus, the Chaldeans already successfully made their predictions from Alexander the Great, Antigonus and Selueco Nicator. The most outstanding monument of the predominance of astrology in the courts of the Eastern kings is the funerary relief of Antiochus I of Comanege, in which the horoscope of the king is represented. In Rome, a critical attitude was always maintained to some extent. Augustus, Tiberius, Nero, Domitian, and almost all subsequent Emperors up to Constantine and Valentinian renewed the old edict of 138 BC, in which the praetor Cornelius Hispalus ordered the Chaldean astrologers to leave Rome and Italy within ten days. This critical attitude was based on political considerations. Requesting astrological information about the emperor's life could be dangerous. In this case, the jurist Peulo called for the crucifixion of the slaves, and for the free, forced labor in the mines or exile. Conversely, the same political interest naturally led to almost all the Roman emperors making extensive use of astrology privately. Nero executed, based on astrological predictions, a multitude of Romans. Adriano, for his part, was so steeped in astrology that every new year he drew his horoscope and calculated not only the exact day of his death, but even the hour and minute. Astrology reached its apogee at the court of the Severans, who granted him a professorship paid by the State. On the other hand, the fact that astrology had its martyrs naturally increased its prestige among the people.

The great predicament of astrology led to its imprint on the whole new image elaborated by astronomy and geography: the earth is a sphere that moves freely in space and is surrounded by the seven planetary spheres and the sky of the fixed stars. Beyond the Moon begins the pure ether, and with it, the celestial and eternal world. This representation did not agree with the old image of the world, according to which the earth was a flat disc covered by the vault of heaven, below which lay the dark underworld. Could not miss the development, at least among educated people, of new representations of the afterlife. The new image of the world supported the old belief, already attested to in Aristophanes, that souls ascend to heaven, the deceased becoming a star in the firmament. Among the Stoics, based on all this, the representation of the soul was imposed as a spark from the fire of the universe that returns to its origin when man dies. More popular was the conception of the Pythagoreans, who recognized in the Sun and the Moon the island of the blessed, transferring the Elysian Fields to the Moon. The most comprehensive exposition of this new image of the afterlife is offered by Plutarch at the end of his writing On the face that appears in the orb of the Moon. Man is composed of three parts: skin, soul and reason. The body comes from the earth and stays there. The soul comes from the Moon, but it separates in death from reason, which in turn belongs to the Alone, and wanders for a long time through the intermediate air between the Earth and the Moon, where bad actions are punished. According to a related view, it is this place in general the locus mortis et inferorum. Virgil's story still has a greater popular aftertaste: the souls are shaken by the winds, drenched by the rains, burned by the fire until they are purified of the stains that are attached to them. Under the influence of astrology, the representations of this 'ñindole gave rise in Hermeticism and Mitrism to the theory of celestial travel. The great mass of the people remained on the sidelines of such speculations. The simplest belief was still attached that only the souls of the just ascend to heaven, to participate there in the eternity of the star gods, or else to penetrate, once again, to the Moon, to Elysion. Funerary epigrams, monuments and sculptures testify to this.

Astrology not only propagated a new image of the world, but also modified the ancient pantheon of Greco-Roman gods. As soon as the gods of Olympus were assimilated to the stars, Saturn and Jupiter becoming planets, their primitive character was also altered. Outside of Mithraism, specifically astrological gods were never worshiped. An exception represents the cult of the sun, which already existed in Greece since ancient times as a private cult. Since Cleanthes called the Sun egemonikon of the new world, Stoics and astrologers converted to the theory of the predominance of the Sun over the other celestial bodies. Philosophers and semi-philosophers, such as Apollonius of Tyana and Proclus, raised their prayers to the Sun, at dawn, at noon and at sunset. The decisive stimulus for the development of aThe solar religion in popular belief was undoubtedly the introduction of the solar year with the Julian calendar under Caesar in 46 BC As an independent god, Helios appears, at first almost exclusively, in the territory of eastern Jordan and in Syria , where he is represented by Aumon and Hadad. He is often identified with the universal god Sarapis. According to a later testimony, Liber, Mars, Mercury, Aesculapius, Hercules, Sarapis, Adonis, Attis, Isis, Pan, Saturn, Jupiter and Hadad are identified with the Sun. This solar monotheism was, in the first instance, the work of philosophy. Helios was introduced to the ancient cults long before he developed an independent cult. The emperors were the first to make sun worship a state cult. The new form of the State, with its monarchical apex, it demanded a correlatively organized city of the gods. The first emperor to whom the name neos Helios was attributed was Caligula. He then pleased Nero to represent himself in the role of the solar divinity: on coins he appears with a crown of rays. With the Severan dynasty, the solar cult of Eastern origin gained primacy. But until 274 d. C., with Aureliano, the introduction, as a state cult, of the solar divinity of Palmyra was not achieved. The day of the foundation of the Roman temple of the Sun, December 25, was henceforth celebrated as the birthday of Sol invictus. Subsequently, the Flavian dynasty, whose last member, Emperor Julian, erected the most sublime literary monument to the Sun, was linked to the sun god, especially the Flavian dynasty.


Much more abstract than the Sun god was the motley aeon god. On the basis of certain Persian ideas, an attempt was made with him to create a supreme deity that would correspond to the new image of the world, a personification of the notion of time and eternity. The new god appears for the first time in Syria and Phoenicia, hidden behind Chronos, who worshiped cities like Byblos and Berito as their founder and poliate divinity. At the beginning of the Ptolemaic era, Eon appears as the patron deity of Alexandria. The culminating moment of his worship was in this city the annual festival held on the night of January 5-6. On this night, the image of the god, a naked wooden statue provided with gold seals in the form of a cross on the forehead, hands and knees, was taken from the underground adyton of the temple of Core. to take it in procession through the city and reintegrate it back into the adyton. Simultaneously she resounded the liturgical exclamation: «In this hour Core today gave birth to aeon». The idea of ​​the birth of the eon presupposes that eternity was understood as the essence of time that is constantly renewed. That is why it is not surprising that in the magical papyri of Leiden occasionally both the supreme aeon and singular aeons are spoken of. In them the tendency to invoke the solar god as an aeon is perceived. Likewise, the apostille “eon” is found on Alexandrian coins minted in commemoration of the passage of a Sothis period in the year 138-139 AD. C. The graphic symbol of the time period that was renewed was the rejuvenation of the solar bird Phoenix. The representation of aeon passed from Alexandria to Rome, where it was identified, from the 1st century BC with the ancient Roman god of the beginning, Janus, developing in connection with it the notion of the eternity of the Roman Empire. Closely connected with all this was the hope of a new saeculum, of a new aeon of peace and happiness, to which Virgil (4 Eclogue) and Horace (16 Epodus) gave their classical expression.


Astrology starts from the basis that the universe is governed by an unbreakable regularity. With this could be related the old Stoic theory of the heimarmene elaborated especially by Chrysippus in the sense of an iron fatalism. The heimarmene became a synonymous notion of astrology. The destiny of men and even that of the gods is inevitably linked to the action of the stars: fata regunt orbem, certa stant omnia lege. The advantage of the astrologer lies in avoiding, thanks to his knowledge, the heimarmene of the fluctuations between the tykhe and the elpis. But precisely this knowledge of the heimarmene made astrological fatalism even more oppressive than the Homeric fatalism of the Moira. It is not surprising, then, that consistent spirits, like Tiberius, neglect the cult of the patriotic gods in the conviction that everything is subject to fatum. The people accommodated themselves to his almighty law, respected it, but did not address prayers or offerings to it. One even finds in certain hermetic treatises (1, XII, XVI) the doctrine of the malignancy of the heimarmene and of the stars as malefic powers. The Neoplatonists simply equated the heimarmene to matter. The stars had become such fearsome tyrants that the people, if they were not satisfied with the diminished consolations of philosophy, would seek their salvation, on one side, in magic, and on the other, in the mystery cults. One and the other, each in their own way, promised the liberation of the heimarmene and with it soteria. he respected her, but made no prayers or offerings to her.

The stars had become such fearsome tyrants that the people, if they were not satisfied with the diminished consolations of philosophy, would seek their salvation, on one side, in magic, and on the other, in the mystery cults. One and the other, each in their own way, promised the liberation of the heimarmene and with it soteria. The Neoplatonists simply equated the heimarmene to matter.

### 4. The Mantic

The astrologers' vision of the future was, so to speak, the scientific form of divination. But when the Greeks speak of mantiké and the Romans of divinatio, they were not primarily thinking of astrology, but of other older forms, which had nothing to do with rational calculations. The mantic was an episteme prodelotike praxeos anei apodeixeos (Pseudo-Plato, Horoi 414 B), a gift from the gods, which was granted to men since the most remote times. Since the days of Homer, a category of seers, of oracular priests and priestesses, of inspectors of sacrificial victims, as well as interpreters of bird flight, of signs, and of dreams, had been increasingly constituted. The Ionian physical philosophers and the Epicureans decidedly rejected mantics, but this found, on the other hand, in Pythagoras, Empedocles, Socrates and Plato no less firm defenders. The oracular mantics from the fourth century passed into the background, as a result of the increasingly generalized skepticism, and progressively gave way to astrology with its apparently more exact methods. The lack of critical spirit and the new credulity of the late imperial age led, however, to a late flowering of mantic practices, to which the Neopythagoreans, the recent Stoics and especially the Neoplatonists cooperated not a little. Its progressive development is evidenced with great clarity when comparing the two main writings on mantics that have been preserved to us: Cicero's De divinatione, and Iamblichus's Peri mysterion. However, this comparison also shows that the presuppositions and modalities of mantics did not undergo essential modifications throughout all of Antiquity. The Ciceronian division of divination into a divinatio naturatis and an artificial divinatio (De div. I 49) can be used in all centuries. Along with immediate divination, based on ecstasy or natural gifts, the mediate vision of the future derived from the combination of observations and the conclusions drawn from them coexisted at all times. As a kharisma in the strict sense, only the former was considered, while the latter was a tekhné that could be learned.

As a kharisma in the strict sense, only the former was considered, while the latter was a tekhné that could be learned.

Naturally, manticism, like magic, was subject to certain constraints. The oracles normally only occurred on special days and in certain places, located mostly near sources, natural pits or craters. Also, the gift of divination was reserved from ancient times to certain families of seers and priestly castes, especially in places where divination was practiced as a trade. Personal requirements were everywhere the fulfillment of certain precepts of purity and pious abstention from certain delicacies and sexual commerce. In the oracular temples, a sacrifice had to be made first. Those moments in which the soul detaches itself from the body, namely: the state of agony and that of nocturnal sleep, were considered especially favorable to private divination. especially after midnight. Children and boys at puberty were often used as mediums for revelation, because they were still considered innocent.

The oldest Greek oracle, that of Dodona in Epirus, offers a combination of ecstatic and artful mantic. In the ancestral temple, consecrated to the Dodonean Zeus and his wife Dione, the priests, called hypophetai, led an ascetic life “with their feet unwashed and lying on the ground.” In the rustling of the leaves of the sacred oak they heard the voice of their god. In the fourth century, oracular communication was carried out by means of a bronze vessel that was made to resonate. The role played in the cult of Dodona by the sacred doves, mentioned by Herodotus (II 55), remains unexplained. The importance of this oracle did not reach that of the oracle of Delphi, but it was, however, so great that Croesus himself sent emissaries to consult him (Herodotus, 146). Lead tablets were used for consultation,

The true oracular god of the Greeks was not Zeus, but Apollo, whose oracles were scattered throughout the Greek world. At Delphi, the main place of her worship, Apollo, who presumably came from Asia Minor, displaced the cult of the earth goddess, Ge, whose name is still preserved on the omphalos, the sacred stone of Delphi. Apollo, likely, already brought with him from his micro-Asian homeland the Pythia as a medium of revelation. The ancient legend that the holy tripod of the prophetess was found on top of a cleft in the ground from which enthusiastic vapors emanated is, without a doubt, a secondary explanation of the priests of a rationalist character, to which the real existence of a natural pit nearby. In any case, the French excavations of 1913 did not discover anything of the kind under the temple. How the Pythia issued her oracles is something that has not been clarified to this day. On the other hand, the form in hexameters of these allows us to suppose that Apollo intended not only to give advice in the singular cases that were presented to him, but also general norms of human behavior that transcended them and could be easily retained in memory. In fact, through its demands for atonement, which prescribed sacrifices to certain gods and heroes as a remedy for droughts, plagues and all kinds of calamities, the oracle of Delphi had a very decisive influence on the religious and legal evolution of the Greek states. . Even more important was his political and ethical activity. Many times he sanctioned the foundation of colonies, but its neutrality during the Persian wars was disputed. Of enormous ethical scope, on the contrary, had to be his insistence on the duty of blood revenge. The growing importance of the oracle is clear from the news that later two Pythias alternated in it and a third remained ready to relieve them. At the beginning of the imperial age, of course, a single Pythia was again sufficient. This was the time when Plutarch was able to write his well-known writing on the cessation of the oracle. Delphi's prestige rose again, it is true, later. But it fell short of the reputation achieved in the East in the second century AD. C. by the oracle of Apolo de Claros in Colophon. In it, a priest descended into a den, where after drinking water from a fountain, he gave answers in verse. Latin inscriptions testify that the fame of this oracle spread throughout Bithynia, Dalmatia, Africa and Sardinia. In the imperial era, other ancient oracles of Apollo lost importance, such as that of Delos and Didyma, in Miletus, communicated as in Delphi by a woman, as did the ancient oracle of Trophonius, in Lebadea, and the oracular seats of certain divinities such as the Baal of Heliopolis and Hierapolis and the Zeus-Ammon, in the oasis of Siwa. About the external procedure of the oracular consultation reports an inscription of the oracle of Apollo of Corope (ca. 100 BC). According to this, the priest, the scribe, the prophet, a strategos, a nomophylax and three police officers had to be present during the communication of the oracle. Forecasts were also taken for large influxes of public. Following the sacrifice, the scribe wrote down the names of the oracle's consultants and called them by list. The officials of the oracle, dressed in white and crowned with laurel, collected the tablets with the questions. The oracular answers, written down like the questions, were deposited in the temple inside a sealed vessel and were not delivered until dawn the next day. Such detailed regulation, which could be similar to the one existing in Delphi and other places, explains why such oracles were consulted almost exclusively on official matters.

As the prestige of the ancient oracular sees was lost, the role played by written collections of oracles, as a means of religious and political propaganda, in almost all popular sectors increased. Its origins were originally the predictions of the Sibyls and Bacids. These soon disappeared as a historical reality, however, the literary genre of the Sibylline oracles continued throughout the centuries, finally reaching Rome. The anonymous prophets who spoke in the name of an ancestral sibyl described the past as fulfilling sibylline predictions, to give the necessary emphasis to the warnings and threats of her predictions. The Sibylline oracles were, especially for the Orientals, the appropriate form of literature to pour into it both his religious ideas and his hidden opposition to Rome. Only the Judeo-Christian sibylline books have been preserved, which do not go back beyond the second century AD. C. Apocalyptic considerations prevail in them, culminating in the announcement of the fall of Rome (book VIII). Along with the Sibylline books, there were also in the Lower Empire the so-called Chaldaic oracula, a collection of prophecies dating back to the theurgist Julian, who lived at the time of Marcus Aurelius. It is not without reason that they have been called the Bible of the Neoplatonists, whose writings and commentaries have preserved for us the only remains that we possess of them. Its goal is the justification of theurgy. Ideologically they can be qualified as pagan gnosis.

Immediate waking contemplation of the future was not only a privilege of professional oracular priests and prophets, but also of all Gnostic magicians. At least, so the late tradition affirms. These individuals passed from time to time through ecstatic states of emotional frenzy, which allowed them to contemplate not only the upper world, but also the future. The most detailed description of this state is given by Plotinus (Fnn. IV g, 1), to which Porphyry refers (Vit. Plot. 23) that in the space of nine years he experienced this wonderful experience four times, while he personally he had only one at the age of sixty-eight. Iamblichus distinguishes in detail epiphanies of gods, archangels, angels, daemons, archons, heroes, and souls of the dead (De myst. II 34), in which, of course, voice auditions must also be included. All this corresponds to the form of ecstasy, as already described by Cicero. In it, the fact that it is the soul that leaves the body and rises to the intelligible world or that it is the pneuma of the divinity that penetrates the human soul does not matter too much. Apollonius of Tyana and the other individuals previously called “thaumaturgists” enter fully into this way of life, as do some of the seers of mythical and historical times of whom the Greek tradition informs us.

Finally, the vast field of dream mantics belongs to the phenomenology of immediate, non-artificial divination. Cicero himself (De div. 125ff), relying on Socrates, Plato, Aristotle, Sophocles, etc., maintains the divine character of dreams. Pliny (Nat. hist. VIII 53) thought that the soul of the sleeper came out through his mouth during dreaming and wandered through the most remote places. Homer (Od. XIX 560) already knew that dreams could be true or illusory. This finding later led to erudite disquisitions on the favorable moment of dreams. Plutarch devoted an entire job to discerning why daydreams were unreliable in late autumn. The interpreters of dreams, as Apolonio de Tiana observes, only used to explain the dreams they had during the early morning, when the dreamer was no longer under the influence of the wine drunk at dinner. Whoever wished to have a premonitory dream abstained from all foods of heavy digestion. A wide range of food and temperance precepts, partly superstitious, was compiled in thick volumes. They do not take into account whether they are private daydreams at home or incubation daydreams in a sanctuary. The most famous incubation oracles, those of Asclepius and Sarapis, have already been discussed before. In fact, they were preferably used for therapeutic purposes and rarely for divination. On the other hand, the dream oracles of certain heroes and heroines had a strictly mantic character. Naturally, some gods also had their dream oracles in certain places, especially Pluto-Hades. Even in the Capitoline Jupiter temple itself, incubation was occasionally practiced to obtain revelations. But even the souls of the ordinary dead could dispense dreams. To participate in them, people lay down to sleep on top of tombs or in the so-called entrances of Hades, where inspiration was also received in the waking state. Dreams ultimately played a great role in magic. Through incense and magical formulas, magicians believed they could coercively produce certain dreams, even in other people, who were influenced by them in the way magicians intended. Conversely, the magicians also knew, of course, all kinds of magical means, parts of animals, plants, stones, etc. that avoided the torment of nightmares and premonitory dreams of misfortune. A problem in itself was the correct interpretation of dreams. Most of them did not immediately transmit a vision or an oracle, but had to be interpreted technically because of their allegorical-symbolic character. Hence, since Homer, the interpreters of dreams are known, who very soon codified the principles of their art, the oneirokritiké, in books of their specialty. Its strict systematization produced the impression of something scientific. Only the dream book of Artemiodoro de Efeso, from the 2nd century AD, has been preserved, which summarizes the oldest literature on the subject, completing it with collections of examples and offering, in turn, a theory of dream interpretation . The most effective dream-critical method was to make an effort to find the analogies that allowed establishing the dream content and the circumstances of the person who had the dream. The head refers to the master of the house, the foot, to the slaves the right hand, to the mother, to the son, to the brother or to the friend, the left to the wife, the daughter, the sister, the loved one, etc. The most daring combinations made it possible to give meaning to any oneiric plot. Artemidorus deals, with special thoroughness, with the interpretation of erotic dreams. His book is a mine of data for the cultural historian. to the brother or friend the left to the wife, daughter, sister, beloved, etc. The most daring combinations made it possible to give meaning to any oneiric plot.

No less extensive than that of immediate, non-artificial manticism, was the scope of artificial and mediate divination, based on the observation and interpretation of perceptible signs and processes of the external world. By virtue of the retreat of the ancient oracular sees, it progressively gained ground, acquiring at the same time magical nuances. This type of magic is primarily interested in signs that are offered without human intervention. Since Homeric times, certain phenomena of nature were observed, such as thunder, lightning, the rainbow. Then attention was given to solar and lunar eclipses, colliding constellations of stars, comets, meteors and similar phenomena. Lightning and thunder to the right were a lucky omen; on the left, an unlucky one. Omen of misfortune were all unnatural phenomena, such as rains of blood and stones, the unusual sounds of fauna, as well as deformations and abortions. Certain signs in the flame and in the smoke of the fire demanded a technical interpretation. Omens were also seen in the excessively rapid growth or sudden withering of plants, in the flight and cawing of the eagle and various nocturnal birds and birds of prey. Certain animals, such as spiders, hares and cats, presaged misfortune; others, like the deer, the bees and ants, fortunes. Even mice, weasels, moles, and snakes, as well as certain kinds of sacred fish, were subjected to careful observation. Apparently innocuous human reactions, such as involuntary movements of the eyelids, those of certain fingers and limbs, as well as the sneeze, could have a deep meaning. With special exuberance, especially among the Romans, the belief in the meaning of such spontaneous manifestations developed. Above all, the conviction spread that man was in a position to appropriate or reject the sign from himself through formulas, such as accipio ornen or ad me non pertinet. The Romans also believed that they could protect themselves with expiatory sacrifices, certain formulas of prayers or even symbolic actions of the threat of misfortune announced by the bad sign. Monstrous creatures born of men or animals were put to death because a prodigium was seen in them. It even went so far as to transform an unlucky omen into a happy one, replacing the dire interpretation of it with a favorable one. This was what Caesar did when he exclaimed, falling to the ground as he jumped ashore on the African coast: “I've got you, Africa.” Even in the smallest details, the theory of the observation, classification and interpretation of lightning and the flight of birds was elaborated, which the Romans took from the Etruscans and entrusted to the public priestly college of the haruspices and augurs.

To the mantic signs that are offered spontaneously are added, finally, those produced by human actions. To a certain extent, the Etruscan-Roman observation of lightning and birds also enters here, since those who exercised it were convinced that they could artificially produce signs of lightning and birds. The interpreters of the flight of birds have been known since Homer. Divination by means of signs obtained from the entrails of sacrificial victims was also common for the poet. Both modalities of divination acquired great importance among the Romans, even in the State, due to the influence of the so-called Etruscan discipline. In later times, inspection of the entrails was extended even to victims and human embryos. Not a small role played, in addition to this, the interpretation of the future by means of artificially caused phenomena next to or on the flames of a lamp, on the surface of water or in magic mirrors. After staring at them for a long time, they thought they saw gods, demons, and souls of the dead. In private, the so-called hydromancy was practiced, consisting of throwing hazelnuts into the water and observing if they floated in it or sank. Among women, a modality of divination consisting of the sudden becoming heavy or light of things that were light or heavy enjoyed special prestige; for example, clods or stones. The magicians believed that they were able to confer inspired language, through the coercion of their formulas, on the hens. Even from inspired chairs (or from their backs) revelations were expected. For magical purposes they could also serve cheeses and hanging sieves. Enchanted rings also gave oracles. Extraordinarily widespread, the different modalities of the oracle by lot were practiced above all in Italy, even in permanent oracular seats. Similar to the oracle by chance is divination by single verses or groups of verses from certain books, such as Homer, Hesiod, Virgil and the so-called Sibylline oracles, which suddenly opened at random. A combination of both forms is offered by the Micro-Asian oracles, who assigned a certain oracular verse to each of the twenty-four letters of the alphabet. Of course, also the external appearance of a man allowed the connoisseur to make more than one prediction. The features of the face, the corporal signs and, above all, the lines on the hand gave clues to his character, the course of his life, and even the time and manner of his death. For this purpose the portrait itself was sufficient for the so-called “metoscopes.”

### 5. The cult of heroes and the dead

Today it can be taken for granted that the roots of the Greek cult of the heroes are already in Mycenaean times, in the cult paid to the deceased members of the ruling families. The Greeks inherited this lineage cult and transformed it into the hero cult proper, assigning each city or territorial community, each lineage, and each town its own heroes. Their local cults corresponded to the division of the Greek people into small states. Newly founded cities or colonies received their Heros ktistes or oikistes. His cult continued even when his name had already fallen into oblivion. Fictitious for the most part, these founders of cities, emerging from their graves, actively intervened in the war as champions, saving cities from all kinds of dangers, singularly or collectively, and they were the ones who gave the Greeks victory in the great decisive battles of Marathon and Salamis. In classical times, the hero was considered to be a defender of the law and to punish lawbreakers. The heroic cult received decisive support from the oracle of Delphi, who very often pointed out to his querent the figure of some new or half-forgotten hero. As his role in popular beliefs increased, the hero became a champion for any predicament. Above all, he had the virtue of expelling diseases, helping lovers, promoting agriculture and livestock. Needless to say, among his gifts was the prediction of the future through dreamlike premonitions. Conversely, the hero could impose deserved punishments, such as pestilence, blindness, epilepsy, and disabling. In the beliefs of the Greeks, heroes were both men and gods: they were figures characterized by their outstanding powers, of whose historicity they were as convinced as of the continuation of their effects after death. Only in this way can it be understood that it could happen that even historical figures were heroized, sometimes already in life: famous generals like Lysander, philosophers like Athenodorus of Tarsos, poets like Sophocles, doctors like Hippocrates of Cos, apart from winners in the Olympic games and legislators. Any city had the power to heroize its citizens of high merit (aferoizein) after their death. The same right was possessed by the congregations, who frequently chose, without further ado, a hero as patron protector. Sometimes it happened that someone made sure in life, for himself and his next relatives, a heroic cult through the appropriate foundations. The notion of hero, finally, was so broadened or so emptied of meaning that it was degraded into an honorary title attributable to almost all the deceased.

The cult of the hero was concentrated, as is natural, around his tomb, since his remains came to be like a kind of Palladium. That is why the place of his burial tended to be kept secret. In case there were several places that claimed the remains, a legend was invented for their transfer. The tomb was often located in the temple or temple compound of a known deity, particularly the founder of the cult or the builder of the temple. In the event that the tomb was found in the open field, a small chapel, called Heroon, or an entire temple, which guarded the image of the hero and an altar as a table to eat, was built on it. The sacred precinct of the hero (temenos) was usually covered with trees and surrounded by a wall. The most important requirement for the cult was the necessary offering pit, where the blood of the sacrificial victims was spilled and the other offerings were thrown. You could not eat any of the meat of the sacrificed victims, as they were consecrated to the infernal beings. However, the bloody offerings were successively giving way to bloodless offerings of fruits, cakes, etc. The chthonic nature of the heroes corresponds to the night as the appropriate time to offer them sacrifices. Daytime offerings were made to them only occasionally; In general, annual festivals were held in his honor, in which the faithful community often worshiped the hero with a solemn procession. The regulation of sacrifices often provided that the sacrifice made to the hero was only a preliminary sacrifice to the main sacrifice offered to a divinity. Consistent with this is the not infrequent process of the demotion into heroes of ancient gods, or the reverse, of the deification of certain heroes. In imperial times, the cult of the heroes hardly preserved any of its primitive vigour; but he was still so alive in popular belief that Philostratus was able to write his Heroikos and continue the Christian veneration of martyrs and saints in forms of heroic worship. the cult of the heroes hardly preserved any of its primitive vigour; but he was still so alive in popular belief that Philostratus was able to write his Heroikos and continue the Christian veneration of martyrs and saints in forms of heroic worship. the cult of the heroes hardly preserved any of its primitive vigour; but he was still so alive in popular belief that Philostratus was able to write his Heroikos and continue the Christian veneration of martyrs and saints in forms of heroic worship.


In the cult of heroes, an older form of the cult of the dead was preserved, in clear retrogression already in historical times for the case of common mortals. The large funeral offerings of yesteryear were taken from the dead in Hellenistic times, to become insignificant formalities; funeral sacrifices were replaced by a spiritualized cult of the dead, secured by foundations and celebrated by congregations. Wealthy people deposited capital in land or farms, whose interests or products had to be used by their descendants or a congregation in the care of the tomb and the memory of the deceased. In this way, independent family congregations were founded. Epicurus' testament shows how it could have developed into a philosophical school through the founding of such a cultic congregation. From the fourth century a. C. there were in Greece similar private congregations. But the apogee of these corresponds to the imperial era, especially to the Roman territory. Its members were recruited for the most part from the lower strata of the population, especially those from foreign countries. Common interests united them: worshiping the same divinity, equality of trade (craftsmen, merchants, singers, actors), community education, etc. Almost all these brotherhoods took a god or a hero as their patron, to whom they paid a more or less developed cult. In them, in general, a very intense social life was carried out, with sumptuous banquets. The stability of these brotherhoods was guaranteed by legacies, monthly contributions and their strict statutes. Despite all the differences in detail, it was common to almost all of them to take care of the funeral and take care of the memory of their deceased members, in such a way that it is possible to speak of a multiplicity of purely funerary associations. With some frequency the congregation had a common cemetery or a common memorial for cremation. At the very least, he paid all or part of the burial expenses and took charge of the care of the tomb. Apart from this, the dead were honored with commemorative banquets, which for the most part were held once a year in the community hall.

All these phenomena of popular Hellenistic piety are also found in a similar form or with modifications in contemporary Judaism, not only in the diaspora, but also in Palestma. Jewish magic, along with Iranian and Egyptian, set the standard in ancient times. The Old Testament already contains traces of magical conceptions and practices. Abraham and Enoch were considered to be the first astrologers. The Essenian horoscopes show that astrology also found its way into the circles most faithful to the Torah. Nor were the Essenes unknown to mantics and magically based curanderism. The Hellenistic cult of heroes and the dead has an analogy in the popular veneration of the tombs of the Patriarchs and the Prophets. 

## The mysteries

In the ancient world the designation of mysteries (mystéria or orgia) was already given to certain secret cults, abundant in number, which developed from primitive uses and whose intense activity extends from the seventh century BC. C. to 4th century AD C. A constitutive element of all these cults is, on the one hand, the precept of silence (arcane discipline), which protected the singularities of the rite from profanation, and on the other, the promise to the initiates of salvation in the most there (soteria). Salvation consists in freeing oneself from the domain of destiny, cosmic powers and death, together with the ability to cross Hades without being annihilated and to remain in the afterlife in the company of divinity. This salvation is guaranteed in a double way. In the initiation rite (myésis), which was carried out only once and included several acts, among them almost always a washing, the novice received more than anything else a ritual purification. This constitutes the requirement to take part in the main rite (teleté), whose purpose is the deification of the mystes. This is achieved by participating the mista in the destiny of the god. To this end, the fulfillment of sacred actions (dromena), the display of cultural symbols (deiknymena) and the communication of cultural formulas (legomena) are directed.

In the mysteries we are always faced with primitive chthonic divinities whose cults and festivities are clearly connected with changes in vegetation. These are reflected in the god's destiny, first painful and later triumphant, which is transferred to the mista, making him overcome destiny and death. The differences in detail, however, are so great that it is almost impossible to speak of a homogeneous theology of the mysteries. According to their origin, one can distinguish between Greek mysteries and Eastern mysteries. They sometimes practice missionary activity, but they are tolerant. Differences of blood or social position are clearly receding in them. Consistent with the religious syncretism of the time is the frequent identification of various divinities, as well as the not uncommon initiation into various mysteries. As the precept of silence was generally observed with great fidelity, the sources are very sparing in data. It is necessary to resort to architectural monuments, to representations in stone and glass, to inscriptions, and to the occasional remarks of ancient writers. In some cases, the assertions of the Fathers of the Church, who, as Christians, felt exempt from the obligation of silence, are of great help.

### 1. Eleusis

The cult of Eleusis is of pre-Greek origin. As an agrarian family cult, it comes from the Mycenaean era and has received its specific notes from Minoan elements. Faced with the completely different world of the Homeric gods, typical of the Greek invaders, he was able to maintain himself among the primitive subject population. Following the political incorporation of Eleusis into the Attic state, it was placed under the special tutelage of the basileus of Athens. An epigraphic document allows us to recognize that the influence of Eleusis in the first half of the 5th century went far beyond the borders of Attica. By this time the annual procession must have often numbered some ten thousand participants. Cicero calls Eleusis sancta illa et augusta, ubi initiantur gentes orarum ultimae. From Augustus onwards numerous Roman Emperors began there. Claudius' attempt to transfer the mysteries to Rome failed, because the myesis was always linked to Eleusis and Athens. However, it seems that there was a filial sanctuary in Alexandria. The cult of Eleusis lasted until 395 AD. C., when Alaric's Goths, recently converted to Christianity, destroyed the temple.

From the 7th century BC C., when Eleusis was still independent, comes the pseudo-Homeric hymn to Demeter. In it the central position is occupied by the figure of Demeter, who appears as the goddess of wheat and sowing. The hymn recounts the kidnapping of her daughter Persephone (= Core) by Hades, her anguished search for her mother and the final meeting with the daughter, followed by the rebirth of the still life, as a sign of Demeter's reconciliation with the gods. and the men. The core of the poem is a kind of reprimand made by the goddess in the royal palace of Eleusis, where she found a friendly welcome, but was prevented by the queen's curiosity from carrying out the deification of the king's son, Demophon, who had been entrusted to his custody. Demeter makes herself known in this speech. He orders the erection of a temple and announces the establishment of an orgy, which will be held annually. The poet characterizes this initiation with the following words: «Happy the inhabitant of the earth who has contemplated this; but whoever is not initiated, whoever does not participate in the sacred, does not have the same fate when he disappears under the gloomy darkness ». Similar beatitudes are found in Sophocles and Pindar. They affirm that only the initiate, only the one who has shared holy contemplation, finds “life”, since only he knows “the end of life and the beginning given by Zeus”. Confidence in the face of death: such was the sacred gift of the Eleusinian divinities to the mystics. “Happy the inhabitant of the earth who has seen this; but whoever is not initiated, whoever does not participate in the sacred, does not have the same fate when he disappears under the gloomy darkness ». Similar beatitudes are found in Sophocles and Pindar.

The oldest preserved remains of the Telesterion, that is, of the initiation temple of Eleusis, correspond to approximately the same time as the hymn to Demeter. The room supported by multiple columns, only in the steps that surround it, accommodated about three thousand two hundred individuals. Within stood the Anaktoron, the most sacred place, before which stood the hierophant's throne. The cult image showed the two main divinities of Eleusis Demeter, seated on a basket, and, next to her, Core, with a torch in his hand. The torches, as well as the sacred dances, played a great part in the cult. Following the incorporation of Eleusis into the Attic State, a subsidiary temple was erected at the foot of the Acropolis in Athens. At the head of the staff in charge of the cult was the hierophant, who was the one who showed the sacred objects. He belonged to the noble lineage of the Eumolpidae and his office was for life. From the lineage of the Kerykes were the holders of the remaining priesthoods: the daduchos (torchbearer), the keryx (herald) and the so-called altar priest. A glance at the most important priesthoods indicates that we have at Eleusis an early family cult.

The number of neophytes admitted annually included men, women, and children, Greek-speaking barbarians, and perhaps slaves as well. The myesis was carried out, at least in later times, in the so-called “little mysteries” of Agras, next to the Ilissus, a suburb of Athens. In front of them were the so-called “great mysteries”, which were celebrated in Eleusis and included the sacred spectacle. At Agras there must have been pantomimic representations of the life and miracles of Dionysus. The initiation rite itself is best described by the so-called Lovatelli cinerary urn, which represents the admission of Heracles, the first initiate into the mistenos of Agras. At the beginning there is the celebration of a purificatory or atoning sacrifice in the form of a suckling pig on which the priest pours a libation. Simultaneously cakes and poppy grains are offered. Next, the neophyte, carrying a torch not yet lit, must kneel on a ram skin with his head covered, over which one of the priestesses shakes a sieve of grain (liknon), which was presumably a magical rite of passage. prosperity. Finally, he was allowed to play in the presence of Demeter and his daughter with the serpent, the sacred animal of the goddesses. The initiation also involved a baptism, in which the priestess poured a glass of water on the head of the naked neophyte. These “little mysteries” of Agras were celebrated in the month of Anthesterion (February). Not until the following year were initiates admitted to the “great mysteries” of Eleusis. carrying a torch not yet lit, must kneel on a ram skin with his head covered, over which one of the priestesses shakes a sieve of grain (liknon), which was presumably a magical prosperity rite.

The main festival was held annually at Eleusis during the month of Boedromion (September). It was preceded by a few days of preparations in Athens. But first the Eleusinian iera had to be brought to Athens and deposited in the city's Eleusinion. On the 16th of Boedromión the mystics bathed in the sea. Perhaps the day before, or after, the one that excluded barbarians and murderers from the rites took place. On the 19th of Boedromión, the great procession of the mystists adorned with crowns of myrtle set off along the sacred road towards Eleusis. The Iera Eleusinians had already been associated with the image of the god Iakchos, perhaps identified with Dionysus of Agras. Along the way, various sacrifices were made and sacred dances were performed. Bad jokes were also played, the so-called gephyrismoi, when crossing uncle Cefiso. Apart from the sack of provisions and the walking staff, the men carried small jugs and the women a head-burner covered with branches. At nightfall the procession reached the sanctuary of Eleusis, situated in a landscape of rare beauty. Presumably, the misistas had to make a confession upon arrival, on which their admission to the cultic ceremonies on the night of initiation was conditioned. This is the so-called synthema that Clement of Alexandria has transmitted to us: «I fasted, I drank the kykeon, I took from the kiste, I operated on it, I put it back in the kalathos and from the kalathos I put it in the kiste». The mista referred to a total fast which Demeter ended in the hymn at nightfall by drinking barley water. This sacramental drink was followed by a sacramental action of a peculiar nature: the mista took out of the basket containing the Eleusinian iera an object with which he operated (ergasamenos). Today it is accepted that this object was a representation of Demeter's maternal womb, that the mista passed through her body to fulfill a rite of adoption and rebirth. But it was not this, but the epopteia, the holy contemplation, which constituted the proper content of the night of initiation and which represented, at the same time, the ultimate source of the mist's afterlife hopes. What was contemplated, is explained by a papyraceous fragment, in which Heracles clarifies: “I contemplated the fire..., I have seen Core”. Simultaneously, the hierophant rang out the liturgical exclamation: «The lady gave birth to a holy child, Brimo to Brimos», that is, “the Strong to the Strong.” From this it can be concluded that the mist was shown how Core gave birth to a divine child. From this contemplation the initiates drew the conviction that they too would be granted a new birth upon death. Perhaps the last act of this spectral ceremony was the exhibition of the spike, cut in sacred silence by the hierophant in which a symbol of inexhaustible fertility and vital force was seen. The preserved documents say nothing about this often supposed pantomimic representation of the entire myth of Demeter and Core. In the same way, there is no news that on the night of the initiation the precept to honor the gods, respect parents and take care of the lives of animals, attributed to Triptolemus, played any role. whose figure frequently appears in Demeter's retinue. That at least in certain popular sectors, the effect of initiation was understood in a purely magical way, is indicated by Diogenes's sarcastic comment. He did not want, he came to say, to belong to a community that apparently promised a better fate to a thief than to a just uninitiated. Despite this, it should not be overlooked that the association of the beliefs of the afterlife with the pathetic image of the divine mother gave the Eleusinian cult a peculiar religious depth. belonging to a community that apparently promised a better fate to a thief than to a just uninitiated.

### 2. Dionysus

The origin of the Dionysian religion is still disputed today. Probably the homeland of the god is to be sought in Thrace as well as in Phrygia or Lydia. It arrived in Greece, at the earliest, at the time when the most recent strata of Homer's epic were developing. Despite his, in principle, non-Hellenic nature, he largely determined the essentials of the Greek spirit: dithyramb, tragedy, and comedy developed under his patronage. From the 5th century BC. C. the cult of him adopted a mysterious form, but, unlike Eleusis, it took on a markedly proselytizing character. Frequently, the god is represented as a traveler or as a newcomer: the sailboat or the chariot in the form of a ship serves as a vehicle. From an early age he forged close ties with other gods, with Demeter in Lerna, with Yahweh in Syria, with Osiris in Egypt, with the fertility god Liber Pater in Italy. The prestige of the new god became so great that even Apollo of Delphi himself, so different in his way of being, welcomed him in his sanctuary. His emissaries traveled the lands fully aware of his missionary character. Livio tells in a fictional way how he arrived in Etruria at the beginning of the 2nd century BC. C. a devotee of Dionysus of low extraction and founded a mystery brotherhood there; but already for the V century a. C. is attested to a cemetery of mystics of Dionysus in Cumae, southern Italy. The famous inscription of Agrippinilla from Túsculum enumerates, for the Dionysian community of a small town alone, more than four hundred members. In part, his worship was also fostered by the state. Antiochus IV Epiphanes forced the Jews to participate in the festival of Dionysus. Ptolemy IV Philopator ordered all the presidents of the Dionysian communities in Egypt to deposit their ieros logos in Alexandria, where a register of all of them was made, and to declare, at the same time, from whom they received initiation. Presumably, the king's intention was to carry out a state inspection of the cult and to homogenize it at the same time, since it had taken very different forms in different localities. In his case, there was no central sanctuary as at Eleusis. Dionysus had his main seat during the Empire in Asia Minor; but no god in the entire Hellenistic world enjoyed such great prestige.

In his case, there was no central sanctuary as at Eleusis. Dionysus had his main seat during the Empire in Asia Minor; but no god in the entire Hellenistic world enjoyed such great prestige.

Dionysus penetrated even into non-Greek Palestine, as indicated by his cult at Scythopolis-BethSean and Damascus and his equating with the Nabataean Dusares. Therefore, mystery cults were not unknown to Judaism from the rabbinic era.

The peculiarities of Dionysus cannot be reduced to a simple formula. In contrast to Demeter, he is not the god of cultivated nature, but of free and wild vegetation in its growth and consumption. This is already alluded to by the important symbols of the cult of him mentioned by Plutarch with regard to ancient festivals: “A jug of wine, a branch, a male goat, a basket of figs and also a phallus.” Dionysus conquered the world as Bacchus, god of wine. His epiphanies were almost always accompanied by the miracle of the blossoming and ripening of a branch in a single day. In processions a wooden phallus was carried. The male goat played a great role as his inseparable companion and as a sacrificial victim. The god, for his part, often appeared to his devotees in the form of a raging bull. As a symbol of his haunting presence, a larger-than-life-size mask served in the cult. Dionysus is always surrounded by women. The entourage of raving maenads is inseparable from the usual image of the god. Women are the enthusiastic devotees of him. Enthusiasm, madness and ecstasy denote the appearance of him. Unlike Demeter, Dionysus suddenly seizes the spirit of his faithful, in such a way that they fall into delirium “full of the god.” This is especially true of the origins of the cult. Like no other god, Dionysus taught the men of the Mediterranean to know all the possible heights and heights of life experience.

Like no other god, Dionysus taught the men of the Mediterranean to know all the possible heights and heights of life experience.

As discrepant as its nature is the origin of the new god, as the myth tells us. Dionysus comes from the union of Zeus with a mortal, Semele, daughter of Cadmus. But as she, being pregnant, insisted on contemplating her lover in her own figure, she was struck by the divine lightning and was charred. Zeus plucked from her corpse the fruit of her love, when she was six months old, and made it ripen on her hips. For this reason Dionysus is the “twice born.” Zeus handed over the child to the custody of the nymphs. The myth continues with the account of the persecution and death of the god. The titans, egged on by Hera, tore apart and devoured the divine child. At Delphi even his tomb was shown. However, Pallas was able to save the heart of Dionysus; Zeus swallowed him and brought him to life a second time. Dionysus later married Ariadne at Knossos, and later he went to look for his mother and his wife, dead in the meantime, in the underworld. According to another tradition, the persecuted god threw himself into the sea and returns carried by the waves in spring. In this way, Dionysus offers a double aspect: as the one who disappears and returns and as the one who dies and is reborn.

From Livy's account and from a number of monuments, especially the well-known paintings in Pompeii's Villa Item and the Casa Omérica, the following details of the initiation rite can be inferred. A priestess indoctrinates the novice on the necessary uses, having him read from a papyrus scroll to a child. After the initiating has fasted for ten days and abstained from sexual intercourse, a banquet is held. A purifying bath ends this first phase. The individual in question is then taken to the temple, where the first thing he does is bind himself by oath to secrecy. A main role is played by a basket and a grain sieve, containing the iera, both instruments perhaps from Eleusis. An essential operation of the act of initiation is to teach the neophyte, for the moment covered with a veil, the content, in principle also covered, of a sieve that shakes over his head. Said content, which is shown to him, consists of fruits and a phallus, which are symbols of fertility and boundless life force. According to Livy, three days a year were first set aside for initiation and then five days a month. As the god does not exclude anyone from his possession, children, slaves and barbarians figure in the number of his initiates, but above all women.

The mistas participated perhaps several times a year in the main nocturnal festival. The faithful dressed in the manner of the divine entourage (thiasos) of Dionysus: the men of satyrs and silenus, the women of maenads, and entered the forest (in Rome along the banks of the Tiber). Women, left alone in ancient Greece, untied their hair. To the enthusiastic sounds of the double flute, between the agitation of the thyrsos and the rattle of the rattlesnakes, the faithful danced by the light of the torches and indulged in eccentric movements. The goal pursued was ecstasy, in which, according to the conviction of the participants, the god seized his faithful. It was then that the mistas became bakchoi in the strict sense. At that time it could happen that they seized a wild animal, They will tear him to pieces and devour his flesh raw, an allusion to the tearing apart of Dionysus by the Titans. That such a Dionysian paroxysm sometimes produced a total exhaustion, is something that not a few representations visualize. The bacchantes imagined during their ecstasy to see streams of milk and honey flowing from the earth (less often of wine). However, this orgiastic element receded, as the cult of Dionysus took the form of a strictly regulated mystery festival. In the second century a. C. the statute of the Athenian Iobakchoi forbade the participants to do or say anything that was not expressly prescribed. The ecstatic frenzy of yesteryear led to meticulously regulated parties and processions, as shown by the accumulation of titles attested by epigraphy. Among the priestly duties was a theology, perhaps an indoctrination in the form of preaching about the miracles of the god. A hymnodidaskalos was to lead the singing of hymns. In the public processions (pompai), arranged with great pageantry, which even children imitated, some of the participants represented Dionysus and his divine retinue, others carried the image of the god, the kiste or the phallus, others carried torches. Boykoloi, or sacred dancers, were never lacking. The main theme of the Dionysian dromenon was always the return or rebirth of the lost or dead god. The forms varied. In Rhodes the god was awakened to the strains of a hydraulic organ; in Lerna he was made to come out of the water to the sound of trumpets ~; on the heights of Parnassus he was awakened in winter every two years under the patronage of Liknites, as if he were a child asleep in the cradle. The hopes of immortality of the mystics were intertwined in the cult solemnities prefigured in the myth. Bacchic actions were represented in multiple sarcophagi from Roman times: the dead mista had to continue them in the subterranean world.

The peculiar way of being of the god and the nocturnal nature of his festivals attracted people's mistrust of his worshipers from very early on. Euripides already makes Pentheus repeat several times that the initiates were more interested in Aphrodite than Dionysus. Pentheus intends to execute the leader of the Dionysian movement. In 186 BC C. the Roman authorities officially accused the faithful of Dionysus of wanton debauchery, murder and other similar false charges. Prison or death was his destiny. Caesar was the first to introduce the cult of Liber Pater fused with Dionysus. Dionysus therefore had martyrs, which perhaps increased his proselytizing force in no small way. In fact, it is possible that he visited quite frequently, specifically in Italy, to immoral excesses that arouse a justified rejection. But excesses are by no means characteristic of the cult of Dionysus. The statute of the Iobakchoi required prior to initiation an express verification of the merits of the neophyte. Neither misgivings nor occasional faults could, in any case, stop the triumphal march of this great divinity.

### 3. Other Greek Mysteries

The defective state of the sources does not allow to draw a coherent picture of the other Greek mysteries. Here we will limit ourselves to collecting isolated news of some importance that considerably complete the overall picture. Close kinship with Eleusis have the mistenos of Pheneos arcadio. From year to year, the great telete of the Kidaria and the “little Eleusinians” were held alternately. According to that, two cults met in the temple. According to Pausanias, there was next to the temple a stone cairn formed by two large rocks, almost joined, between which the sacred documents of the mysteries were preserved. They were only taken from there on the day of the Kidaria festival - therefore, once every two years - and read aloud to the initiates. A private reading of the ieros logos, as far as we know,

Also related to Eleusis are the Andama mysteries. A large inscription from the year 92-91 BC. C., which contains the law of the mysteries, clearly shows the predilection of this place for police and bureaucratic regulations. The mysteries here seem to be more of a popular festivity than a religious solemnity. The oath of those responsible for orderly organizing the celebration of the solemnity, as well as taking the mandatory oath to the rest of the personnel in charge of the cult, is instructive in this regard. The part that, understandably, was played by the desire to guarantee continuity is attested by the order given to the priests to hand over to their successors the books and everything acquired for the mysteries. Moral demands are completely absent. Only conjugal fidelity is expressly required of “sacred women”. Among the multiple provisions of detail related to the development of the procession, perhaps the most interesting is the one that meticulously deals with the attire of the women. Gold ornaments, cosmetics, headbands, artificial hairstyles, and wearing sandals that were not made from the felt or leather of the sacrificial victims are strictly prohibited. For the rest, the prices of the permitted feminine dresses are fixed, establishing differences between women, girls and slaves from a value of 50 to 200 drachmas. The entire law would have eternal validity. perhaps the most interesting is the one that deals minutely with the attire of women.

Traits related to the cult of Dionysus show the mistenos of the Cabiri or «Great Gods», as they were invoked in the cult. The main sanctuary of him was on the island of Samothrace, where two temples have been excavated. This cult had its heyday in the 2nd century BC. C., but the existence of mystics is attested by epigraphy until the fourth century of the Christian Era. It is originally a couple of chthonic gods, natives of Phrygia, who represented father and son. Later there were four Cabiros called with the mystical names of Axiokersos, Axiokersa, Axieros and Kadmilos. Perhaps there was also a mother-daughter pair among them. In the Greek world -probably due to the insular location of the sanctuary-, the Cabiri became sea gods and, thus, patron deities of the navigators. Its primitive character is indicated, however, by the important role played by the phallus in its cult. Possibly the ieros logos between Cadmilo and Core also figured among the dromena. It even seems that they were not lacking in orgiastic traits. Purification and expiatory rites point to the sacrifice of a ram, attested to in the coins, the red sash carried by the mystics and the two sacrificial pits. A peculiarity of his cult lies in the requirement of the neophytes of a kind of confession of sins, whose function remains unexplained. attested in the coins, the red band carried by the misistas and the two sacrificial pits.

Dionysian characteristics, although partially modified, reappear in the Orphic mysteries, whose establishment was attributed to the mythical sitarist Orpheus, who with his music enchanted not only nature, but even the god of the underworld, Hades, and was, in the end, torn to pieces by maenads. His main divinity is Dionysus, who like Dionysus-Zagreo, torn to pieces and devoured by the Titans, had a fate similar to that of Orpheus. Since men were created from the ashes of the Titans destroyed by Zeus, they were considered guilt-ridden and double-natured. Only a bios orphic can free them from hereditary sin. It is necessary to get rid of the titanic heritage and promote the Dionysian. This was served by the periodic repetition of purification rites and the refraining from eating meat and beans, as well as wearing woolen dresses. Dionysus received the epithet of Lyseus, “Liberator”. It frees initiates from the terrible torments that inevitably threaten the uninitiated in Tartarus, especially malefactors and criminals. The Orphics or Orpheotelestai as they called themselves, are the first in whom an elaborate image of hell is found, which soon became very popular. Closely imbricated in it is the doctrine of the transmigration of souls. According to Luciano, the souls of the rich will incarnate in donkeys and thus spend two hundred and fifty thousand years. Instead, in the tomb of the initiates, gold flakes were placed, the so-called passports of the dead that informed them about the path to the afterlife and their reception among the gods. Itinerant Orphic preachers spread this non-Hellenic doctrine of salvation throughout the world, coupled with a theogony and cosmogony derived from Hesiod. For the first time the phenomenon of the religion of the book comes to our attention in the Greek sphere, since the Orphics put their dogmatic theories and their rites of purification and expiation in writing in books that they offered to the people, especially the rich. Plato and Aristophanes had already read them. But this is not about mysteries in the strict sense. The Orphics did not have a central sanctuary. It also seems that they did not celebrate their festivals, in which community singing played a great role, in temples, but in the so-called “sacred houses” (bakcheia).

It also seems that they did not celebrate their festivals, in which community singing played a great role, in temples, but in the so-called “sacred houses” (bakcheia).

In one case we can even observe the private foundation of new mysteries. Alejandro de Abonutico, a miracle worker, could have dared to establish on his own in the 2nd century AD. C. some mysteries in Asia Minor, which in part imitated the Eleusinians. On the first day he represented the birth of Apollo and Asclepius; the second, the epiphany and birth of the serpent god Glycon; the third, the wedding of his mother with Podalirio and his with Selene, as well as the birth of his daughter. That Alexander took a strong side in the religious struggles of his day is shown by the proclamation of the first day. Alejandro in person exclaimed: “Out with the Christians!”, and the community in unison replied: “Out with the Epicureans!”. The fanaticism of the pseudo-prophet did not flinch even before the stoning of the Christians.

From the fourth century a. C. Eastern religions and Greek spirituality came into close contact. On the one hand, the Greek mentality penetrated deeply into the East and the South. On the other hand, Eastern religions made their way to the West. The increase in trade and traffic of all the Mediterranean peoples with the East also made it possible to break down national barriers in the field of religion. In the last two centuries before the Christian Era, first of all, along with general skepticism, a sick interest in everything foreign that promised salvation spread. The Eastern gods had the enormous advantage of not being worn out like the Greco-Romans and not subject to 'fate'. However, the mystery form was not in itself that of the Eastern cults. In Egypt, it is true, from the Old Kingdom there was a kind of mystery representations that gave dramatic shape to the saga of the gods. But these representations had no sacramental value with respect to the afterlife of the faithful. In Mesopotamia, esoteric rites and doctrines were known, which have been called “divine mystery”. But his knowledge was a privilege of the priests. Hence it remains most probable that it was the Greeks or semi-Greeks who were the first to give mystery form, after the model of their mysteries, to foreign cults, on the basis of occasionally existing similarities. That this could not happen without considerable assimilation into the Greek mentality is evident. The other way, the foreign elements were largely maintained because the attractiveness of the new cults lay precisely in them. In what follows, the most important of the Eastern mystery cults will be treated.

### 4. Cybele and 

Attis Cybele, the Great Mother Goddess, and her partner, the godjuvenile Attis or Popes, are originally from Asia Minor, where their cult had spread in Phrygia, Lydia and Galatia. Its main focus was in the city of Pesinunte. It was governed by a sacred royalty, whose holders officiated as priests of Attis and bore his name. The so-called metragyrtai, mendicant priests who went from country to country, developed a great missionary activity in favor of the Great Goddess of fertility. In Egypt he found welcome at court, but did not become popular. In Greece, too, the new cult met with resistance because of its partly barbaric character, but it found enthusiastic devotees in the port cities, part of whose population was of Micro-Asian origin. The year 304 a. C. was introduced in Rome by indication of a Sibylline oracle went to the East to look for the sacred meteorite of the goddess, because help was expected from him in front of Carthage. After the victory over Hannibal, the goddess obtained a sanctuary on the Palatine. The cult of the Magna Mater, as she was called from then on, remained almost isolated, because equivocal traits were discovered in it, completely foreign to the Roman mood. Only Phrygian priests could attend the cult; citizens were forbidden to participate in the holy orgies. It was with Claudio that for the first time these limitations gave way to a decided predilection. The prince became the supreme leader of the cult, which since then penetrated, as an integral part of the Roman religion, in all the Latin provinces. In Rome, Attis definitively absorbed the Microasian moon god, Men; he was considered a solar divinity and was identified with Adonis, Bacchus, Pan, Osiris and Mithras. As Pantheos he simultaneously wore the crown of thunderbolts and the crescent moon. The cult of him ended with his official dissolution and the confiscation of his funds the year.

The myth of Attis existed in a double form. According to Lydian tradition, Attis was a boy who brought the inhabitants of Lydia as Cybele's orgy, but was killed by a boar sent by Zeus. According to the Phrygian tradition, coming from Pesinunte, Attis was the beloved or the son of the Mother of the gods, who in a fit of madness, imposed by her as punishment for her infidelity, emasculated himself, dying as a result. of it. Emasculation, which reappears in all variants of this second tradition, must be understood as a cultural aetiology (vide infra). According to Ovid, Attis, once dead, was transformed into a pine tree, which has since become the sacred tree of Cybele. Attis is frequently shown wearing the Phrygian cap and seated on a throne beside Cybele, or making her triumphal journey with her in a chariot drawn by lions.

The best information we have is about the main festival in Rome. On March 15 rushes were brought to the temple. On March 22, the dendrophori, who also played a major role in city life, carried a pine through the streets of the city to the Palatine, cut in the sacred forest, surrounded by woolen ribbons and adorned with the instruments of the cult (cymbals, kettledrums, flutes, etc.). During the days devoted to the funeral lamentation for the death of Attis, the participants were forbidden to engage in sexual intercourse, eat bread and seeds, and certain kinds of fish. On March 24, called the day of blood, the mourning for Attis came to a head. The brothers who were already castrated (galli), falling into a paroxysmal trance under the roar of Phrygian musical instruments, tore their flesh with knotted whips, bloodied arms and shoulders. Her blood was sprinkled on the god's altar. The novices castrated themselves with archaic instruments to be received into the circle of the galli. Obviously, what they wanted to demonstrate was the overcoming of all sexuality. Perhaps this was also served by the strange custom of castrated men wearing female clothing, while the goddess wore men's clothing. On March 25, she consecrated herself to joy at the resurrection of the god two days after her death. On March 27, the cult image of Cibele was led in a great procession on a cart pulled by cows to the Almón, a stream where she bathed it together with the vehicle.

Presumably, Attis (or Osiris) refers to the news transmitted by Maternal Firmus that, at the end of the mortuary lament, a priest anointed the neck of the mists, murmuring these words: “Rejoice you mists, because the god has been saved.” and, after all our sufferings, we will be made partakers of salvation (soteria)». A kind of sacred banquet alludes to a formula of profession of faith transmitted by Maternal Firmicus: «I have eaten from the kettledrum, I have drunk from the cymbal, I have become a mista of Attis». The somewhat different version of the same formula in Clement of Alexandria ends with the words: “I have entered the adyton.” To this day the question has not been resolved whether the word used here for adyton, viz: pastures, is to be literally translated as “bridal chamber”, as if a sacred marriage of the initiate with the Mother of the gods were to be understood. It has been objected to this interpretation that a correlative model is lacking in the myth. Better known to us is the taurobolium, attested for the first time in inscriptions from the 2nd century AD. C., a kind of baptism of blood, about whose development the Christian poet Prudencio has preserved us, an impressive description. The mista descended into a pit covered by a floor with holes, on which a bull was slaughtered, the blood of which the initiate let run over his head and eagerly absorbed with his tongue. The bull perhaps represented Attis. Next, the mista appeared before the crowd to receive its congratulations. He was estimated, according to a late inscription (from 376 AD) as an in aeternum renatus. Without a doubt, all this constituted a drastic rite of expiation and rebirth. Not in vain was the day of the bullfighting celebrated as a birthday. But it is not an initiation rite, completed once and for all, as might be expected. Rather, it was reserved for men and women who already held a high position in the community. In Prudentius it is a high priest who receives him. An epigraphic testimony attests that it was repeated every twenty years. It was even possible to do it for someone else, especially the Roman Emperor. it was reserved for men and women who already occupied a high position in the community.

Related to the cult of Cíbele-Atis is that of Sabazio, a god also native to Phrygia and also called Savazios, Sabos and similar forms. At the end of the V century a. C. he arrived in Athens, later spreading throughout the Roman Empire, although without reaching the importance of Cíbele and Attis. The Jews of Asia Minor identified Sabazio with Yahweh as the god of the Sabbath, a syncretism already known in Rome in 139 BC. C. Also have a syncretic color representations of the afterlife of Sabazio's devotees, as they appear in the famous paintings of the tomb of Vincen-tius in Rome in the middle of the third century AD. C. An angelus bonus leads the initiate to the banquet of the blessed. A prefiguration of it was experienced by the Sabazio mista at the sacred banquet with which the nocturnal initiation concluded. In the central position of the secret rites was the serpent as a representative of the divinity. The mista passed it across his lap, thereby symbolizing the loving union with the divinity. Moreover, the expiatory and purificatory rites played an important role and the basket with the sacred serpent and the liknon, the grain sieve, were carried in solemn processions to the sound of music, amid frantic dances and ecstatic exclamations of joy. “Evoi, Saboi”. No satisfactory interpretation has been given to the bronze hands showing the form of the Latin benedictio, found chiefly in Italy and in the frontier territories of the Empire; They are probably votive offerings for a happy birth.

### 5. Syrian Gods

Jupiter Dolichenus. In Doliche, a small town in the Commagene region in northern Syria, a god was worshiped in Roman times, usually depicted as riding on a bull that walks to the right. In his left hand he holds the thunder stone and with his right hand he raises the double axe. He is covered with a Phrygian cap and is armed to the nines. This god, known from archaeological evidence, especially from a large number of votive inscriptions, was introduced from the time of Vespasian by Syrian soldiers, merchants and slaves in the West, where he penetrated as Jupiter Dolichenus as far as the Rhine and even Gaul and Britannia. His devotees -mainly Roman legionnaires- called each other fratres and felt “chosen by their god”. This primitive lightning deity was a forerunner of Mithras. It is characterized by universality. He was both conservator totius mundi and exhibitor invictus and received the epithet sanctus. We hardly know anything about his cult. His temples, generally small, had a fountain or a cistern, which is an indication of cultic lavatories. There were also initiation water fonts. It gives the impression that the image of the god was taken in solemn processions. In Rome he had a sanctuary on the Aventine and another on the Esquilmo.

Dea Syria. The lineage's ancestral goddess, Atargatis, had a famous shrine at Hierapolis, along the Euphrates. As Hadad's wife, she was a divinity of procreation and fertility; the phallus figured among the symbols of her cult. Thanks to this peculiarity, she soon became a goddess of nature in general, even a pantheistic goddess of fate, ruler of the lives of men and the course of things. With this function she was introduced in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC. C. by the Syrian slaves in the Greek port cities, in Delos, Sicily and Rome; finally, the eastern troops took her to Britain as a Syrian Goddess. Like Cíbele, she has two lions next to her. In Askalon she was represented as a fisherwoman to Derketo, another of the names of Atargatis. Very widespread was the image that presented her with a crown of walls surrounded by lightning, with a spinning wheel in one hand and a scepter in the other. The myth related how the goddess was born from a huge egg that the fish threw on land and hatched a dove. According to another tradition, the goddess would fall into the Euphrates, or a pond, and she would have been saved by the fish. These traditions claim to give an etiology to the fact that the Syrians did not eat fish and considered pigeons divine. Every Dea Syria temple had a pond. Her mysteries are only attested in an honorific decree of Thuria in Messenia (1st century BC), but they were perhaps also celebrated in Delos, where her temple had a theater. From Lucian and Apuleius we have news of their oriental mendicant priests, who, carrying on an ass the image of the goddess, they toured the countries and collected from the spectators their bloody ecstatic dances and their oracles, which is surely a decadent phenomenon of late times. Likewise, self-emasculation was perhaps belatedly introduced into the Hierapolis cult. It is still disputed whether sacred prostitution in the temples, typical of the Phoenician and Punic cults of Astarte, played any role in their cult.

Adonis. Adonis, the Phoenician god of vegetation, whose main seat was in Byblos, is already attested by Sappho for Lesbos in the 7th century BC. C. Perhaps it has something to do with his early penetration into Hellas, the lack of his mystery cult. The myth has a strong Greek imprint. One of its forms tells how Persephone does not want to return Adonis to Aphrodite, who had given him in custody, so that Zeus has to settle their dispute, deciding that Adonis belongs to each of them for half a year. Better represented is another form of the myth, which probably preserves ancient features: Adonis, lover of Aphrodite, is mortally wounded in a hunt by a boar. For the cult, only the death of Adonis and her mourning for her are of importance, in which all of nature is immersed. The festival of the Adonia was celebrated annually in summer for two days. Theocritus describes it in detail in the case of Alexandria (before even 260 BC). On the first day an exhibition takes place, in which the nuptial union on the bed of Aphrodite and Adonis is shown to the pious crowd. Two wooden dolls lay on purple rugs surrounded by gold and ivory and seasonal fruit, while Erotes fluttered overhead. This was a day of joy for the women, who actually constituted the core of the young god's devotees. On the second day the great funeral lament took place. With gestures of desperation, the women carried the dead loved one to the beach, but their funeral shrine not only contained complaints of pain, but also the plea for a propitious return for the following year. Four hundred years or so later, lamentations and funerary sacrifices were still held at Byblos on the first day, and the second was celebrated as the day of resurrection, during which women had to appear with their hair cut. The head of Adonis, after seven days of stay in the sea, arrived from Egypt to Byblos pushed by the waves. Finally, typical of the Adonis festivals are the so-called little gardens of Adonis, which appear for the first time in Athenian ceramic paintings from ca. 400 BC C. Women put pots on the roof of their house, where seeds of fast-growing plants had been planted. Originally a symbol, perhaps, of the rebirth of nature in spring, they served as a comparison to the flowering and premature death of the god. They were taken together with the dead god and thrown into the fountains. Women represented Aphrodite and her divine consort in these ceremonies. It cannot be determined whether the faithful of Adonis founded on the cult personal hopes of the afterlife.

### 6. Mitra

Mithras is an ancient Iranian god of the sky and light, who is praised in the Avesta as the protector of treaties and the embodiment of fidelity to them. From about 400 B.C. C. he appears in inscriptions of the Achaemenid dynasty together with Ahura-Mazda and Anabita. His festival, the Mithrakana, was brilliantly celebrated at the court of Persia. Mithras entered the West with the expansion of the Persian Empire. In Babylon the belief in Mithras was combined with all sorts of astrological and eschatological ideas, together with which he ultimately reached Asia Minor. Prestigious magicians were his active missionaries there. Presumably it was they who gradually gave the cult of Mithras a mysterious form. According to Plutarch, It was the Cilician pirates defeated by Pompey who first made the mysteries of Mithras known to the West. In Greece, however, Mithras failed to take root. The old aversion to Persian influences persisted. Instead, the success of the Persian god in Italy and in the Latin provinces, where he was introduced by merchants, slaves and Eastern soldiers, was enormous. Thanks to his warrior character, he became the patron god of the Roman legions. Especially on the borders of the Empire, many of his sanctuaries have been preserved, the so-called Mithraea. In Rome alone there must have been about a hundred of them. The foreign cult became fashionable when Commodus was initiated into it at the end of the second century AD. c. With Diocletian, Mithras rose to the status of a state god and was already considered a “defender of the Empire.” December 25 was the birthday of Sol invictus, with whom Mithras had long been identified. His cult, after a brief period of flourishing under Julian, came to an end in the time of Theodosius the Great (394). Until then it was a religion of markedly masculine character.

The various features of Mithras have to be inferred above all from the monuments. The motifs come essentially from the circle of Iranian beliefs, but show extensive Hellenistic influences in their way of exposition. Mithras was miraculously born from a rock, which symbolizes heaven. The shepherds were the first to address their prayers to the naked child, only covered by a Phrygian cap. The main fight of the young god was with the wild bull that was calmly grazing or was in a house. Mithras captures him and leads him, riding on his back, to his cave, from which, however, the bull escapes. At the command of the sun god (transmitted by a raven), Mithras seizes him a second time, jumps sideways onto his back, and mortally wounds him in the neck with his dagger. But this death means a new creation. From the blood of the animal the vine grows and ears of wheat sprout from its tail. The dog and the snake eagerly seek his blood, while the scorpion tries to poison his sperm, which will then give life to all kinds of useful animals. The Sun and Moon are present, and often the seven planets, or the four gods of the winds, or the four seasons, as well, indicating the cosmic importance of the saving act. Mithras further shows himself as the protector of the world and of the human race. During a period of drought imposed by Ahriman he shoots water from a rock with an arrow. Finally, Helios-Sol kneels before Mithras; evidently also forced, he receives his accolade, holds out his right hand to him and celebrates a banquet in his company, finished which both gods ascend to heaven in the chariot of the sun god. An eschatological ending crowns the myth. After the final victory in the fight against Ahriman's troops, Mithras raises the dead and destroys the world after having led the souls of the dead to the highest sphere of the stars.

It cannot be affirmed that the particularities of the myth were dramatically represented in the cult, but there were sacred processions whose participants were shown in the form of animals. Not a small role was played in the temples by reliefs and cult paintings, the main theme of which is the slaughter of the bull. The cult image was found at the back of the main room, conceived as a grotto, on whose longest sides there were benches. This crypt was at a lower level than the rest of the sanctuary. Finds of lamps indicate that refined lighting effects were produced. Thanks to the controversy of the Fathers of the Church, two sacraments of the cult of Mithras are relatively well known. Its resemblance to the Christian sacraments was already perceived by the Fathers of the Church, who interpreted them as crude imitations of the devil. Admission to the community was by baptism of the neophyte in the existing baptismal grotto throughout Mithraeum. Its effect was to purify moral sins and usher in a new existence. Likewise, a sacred banquet was known in which the mists ate bread and water mixed with honey and wine. Presumably, only initiates of a higher degree could participate in it; the lower grade mistas served the table. The priest pronounced words of blessing. Perhaps they were similar to those preserved in a graffito from the Mithraeum of the Aventine (ca. 200 AD): “You saved men with the shedding of eternal blood.” The blood of the bull or the cult banquet, according to that, promised the mystics the heavenly existence and the resurrection.

The members of the cultic brotherhoods were divided into seven degrees of initiation: corax, nymphus, miles, leo, Perses, heliodromus and pater. The first three degrees constituted the group of servants, and the other four, that of the participants in the mysteries. Each of the seven degrees was under the protection of a planet. The interpretation of the names is still debated. In some of them relations with the myth of Mithra can be glimpsed. What is certain is that each grade corresponded to an outfit or a special symbol, whose delivery was made solemnly. At least before initiation the novices were subjected to harsh tests. In the wall paintings of the Mithraeum in Capua the neophyte is seen naked, sitting or kneeling on the ground, blindfolded and his hands tied behind his back. Another lies naked on the ground, a snake slithering up his back. Whoever wanted to reach thousands was obliged to pronounce a sacramentum, an oath: he had to refer to a crown that was held out for him on a sword and affirm that Mithras was his only crown. Likewise, Mithra's “soldiers” were branded on their foreheads with a hot iron (badge or tattoo). They thus consecrated themselves to service in the legions of the deus invictus. The fact that there was also an initiation to the degree of Perses is instructive: this did not deny the Iranian origin. Even in the language of worship Persian notions and formulas were preserved. The title of pater, or pater patrum, indicates that the community felt like one big family. In fact, the mistas considered each other as “brothers”, fratres. Mithras was not only his divine lord, but also his comrade, comes and socius. To a much greater degree than other mystery divinities, the triumphant bullfighter served as an archetype and stimulating model. This precisely made the cult of Mithras a dangerous rival to young Christianity. As terrestrial companions of the chief of his celestial comrades, Mithra's devotees seriously observed a strict morality that could even force them into sexual asceticism. The expenses of the communities were defrayed by the voluntary offerings of their members, especially those of their wealthy patrons, and they preferred to found several communities in the same place.

### 7. Isis y Sarapis

The Hellenistic beginnings of the cult of Isis and Sarapis go back to the religious politics of the Ptolemies. To create a common cult to the two sectors of the population that inhabited the country, the Egyptians and the Greeks, Ptolemy I, son of Lago, introduced at the end of the 4th century BC. C. in Alexandria the devotion of the “new god” Sarapis. Behind him lurked the ancient Egyptian god of the underworld of Memphis, Osiris-Apis, whose name had already been Hellenized in the form of Sarapis or Serapis. The syncretic nature of the entire process is manifested by the fact that an Egyptian priest, Manetho, and a Greek priest, Eumólpida Timóteo de Eleusis, advised the king as advisers. As in the ancient Egyptian cult of Osiris, Isis, Thoth and Anubis appeared alongside the new state god; Nevertheless, all these gods were Hellenized in their outward appearance and their sacred texts were gradually translated into Greek. When the new cult that deliberately took on the mystery form of Demeter's began we do not know, but as early as 220 B.C. C., at the latest, there were private schools in Delos that practiced a Hellenistic-Egyptian mystery cult. In Greece, the great port city of Corinth was a focus of the mistenos of Isis. In the middle of the second century a. C. these mysteries could take root in the south of Italy, in Puteoli and Pompeii. At the time of Sula, the mystery college of the pastóforos was established in Rome. In this way, the Egyptian mysteries spread throughout the Hellenistic world. It is true that at the time of the decline of the Roman Republic the authorities proceeded repeatedly with rigor against the new private cult, because its priests were reputed to be pimps. Caligula was the first to build a temple to him, although, yes, outside the city, in the Field of Mars. In 217 Caracalla revoked the ban on the cult of Isis within the urban precinct and erected a state sanctuary for her within the city. From then on the devotion to Isis spread through almost all the Latin provinces, although it gained its adherents more among the Eastern and Greek emigrants than among the indigenous population. With the triumph of Christianity under Theodosius the Great the public cult perished, but the communities at first subsisted underground. because its priests were famous for pimping.

With the triumph of Christianity under Theodosius the Great the public cult perished, but the communities at first subsisted underground.

A coherent account of the myth, albeit really in its allegorical-philosophical interpretation, is found for the first time in Plutarch. Its nucleus is as follows: Osiris, “husband” or “brother” of Isis, was locked in a chest by his younger brother, Timon (Seth), and thrown into the Nile. Isis, desperate, travels the sea and the land until she finds him finally in Byblos. But Typhon dismembers the corpse and scatters the pieces of it. Isis manages to find them too and recompose them so that Osiris awakens to a new life, after having offered him his son Horus (in Greek, Harpocrates) one of his eyes as food. Horus, long protected by his mother and raised to become an avenger of murder, finally triumphs over Typhon. Osiris continues to live in the underworld as judge of the dead.

The Isis of ancient myth must have already exerted a powerful attraction on the Greeks by her moving human features. Her destiny was analogous to that of Demeter in search of her daughter. For this reason, it is not surprising that already in the 7th century a. C. both fertility goddesses were identified as one in Byblos. To Hethodotus, her identity was self-evident. The frequently depicted motif of Isis with the infant Horus made the Greeks feel that they could expect “sweet motherly love” (dulcem matris adfectionen) from this goddess. Over time, Isis was assimilated to almost all the Eastern and Greek goddesses. In this way, the goddess of a thousand names (Myrionyma) was progressively elevated to the category of a universal goddess. An inscription has recorded her pantheistic character: «goddess Isis, the only one who is everything» (una quae es omnia dea Isis). The so-called aretologies of Isis clearly show how much she meant to the Greeks. Isis recounts in the first person, in the oriental style, her works and her virtues. Twenty-two solemn self-predictions reveal its universality in the famous Cime inscription (ca. 2nd century BC). She has created the entire human culture and morality, she has separated heaven from earth and pointed its course to the stars; she reigns over the atmosphere and the sea. One of her statements also alludes to the mysteries: I have shown men the myeseis. The clearest expression of the hopes of salvation that were placed on the goddess is in her own declaration of having defeated the heirmamene, so that she now pays her obedience.

The clearest expression of the hopes of salvation that were placed on the goddess is in her own declaration of having defeated the heirmamene, so that she now pays her obedience. The so-called aretologies of Isis clearly show how much she meant to the Greeks. Isis recounts in the first person, in the oriental style, her works and her virtues. Twenty-two solemn self-predictions reveal its universality in the famous Cime inscription (ca. 2nd century BC). She has created the entire human culture and morality, has separated heaven from earth and marked its course to the stars; she reigns over the atmosphere and the sea.

The official cult consisted first of two main annual festivals. From October 26 to November 3, the Isia were celebrated in Rome, in which the ancient myth was dramatically represented. The culminating point of the festival was constituted by two reasons: the painful search for Isis and her jubilant discovery of Osiris dead. An important role was played in all this by the priest of Anubis, the god characterized by the head of a dog. At the end, the community exclaimed in unison: «We have found it, we rejoice». The course of birth and perishing could begin anew. The other annual festival was celebrated on March 5 on the occasion of the resumption of navigation, in whose tutelary divinity Isis had been erected. The name of the festival was that of ploiaphfesia, respectively, that of navigium Isidis. That day a ship loaded with precious objects was launched into the sea, followed to the beach by a procession, part solemn and part licentious, with images of the goddess and symbols of the cult (sistrum and kiste). Apart from both annual festivals, Isis and Sarapis received a daily divine worship, which was mainly celebrated by the Egyptian priests appointed for this purpose. The daily ritual consisted of the opening and closing of the temple. The morning began with the awakening of the divinity followed by asperger, incensing, anointing, dressing and offering food to the image of the goddess, who was treated as a human being. Naturally, there was no lack of offerings from the devotees, which later served to support the priests. The temple was open all day for devotions. In certain cases, laymen were allowed to reside for long periods in the sanctuaries. to receive consolation and help from the goddess. Sacred literature, despite existing translations outside of Egypt, continued to be transmitted in its original language. It seems that the Egyptian coloring of the divine service has been tenaciously maintained, especially in Italy. Sphinxes and obelisks, palm trees and sacred ibises, Egyptian inscriptions and jars of sacred water from the Nile, priests with shaven heads, black dancers recalled the patila of the cult of Isis. especially in Italy, the colorful Egyptian divine service.

Apuleius gives a detailed account of the secret initiation in the eleventh book of his Metamorphoses. Although the protagonist is called Lucio, presumably this is a personal testimony of the author. Lucius, freed by Isis from her donkey form, settles in the temple precincts to become the goddess's mista. But he evidently is not allowed this until Isis has given him in person, through dreams and other wonderful experiences, the opportune order, specifying the circumstances in detail. After this has happened, the mista-gogo instructs the novice in the sacred books that are kept in the innermost part of the sanctuary. Immediately afterward, Lucio completes the necessary purchases and then heads, with the assembled community, to the bathroom that follows. In it he receives a kind of sprinkling baptism, finished which the priest gives him absolution. After these previous purificatory rites, the novice -as in the case of Dionysus- must fast for ten days. After these, he is led, at sunset, in a coarse linen dress to the adytun. Before they had given him the other same gifts. About what happens afterwards in secret, Apuleius expresses himself in an allusive and formal way: «I arrived at the border of death, and after having crossed the threshold of Proserpina and crossed all the elements, I returned. In the middle of the night I saw the sun shine with clear light; I came into the presence of the higher and lower gods and addressed my prayer to them from very close." This nocturnal process cannot be explained in all its details. Nevertheless, The fact that Lucius went through the experience of making a journey through the lower and upper world, namely, by virtue of an established cultic rite, is beyond doubt. Presumably it is a passage through twelve zones with twelve transformations, at the end of which the mista appears «initiated with twelve dresses» to finally appear dressed in an «Olympic stole» on a wooden platform in front of the cult image of the goddess and receive the acclamation of the people as a solar divinity (instar solis). For the global understanding of all this, the statement made earlier by Lucio is important: «Initiation is celebrated as a sign of voluntary death and as a liberation granted graciously». Salvation (salus) consists in the mista becoming renatus and instar solis, that is, into a divine being thanks to a rebirth. Nor is it very clear how the new existence was conceived. Evidently it was thought of a prolongation of earthly life, namely: in a divine way. At least, there is no talk expressis verbis of a grant of immortality. Instead, the emphasis is on the fact that the initiate voluntarily takes upon himself the yoke of service and, as a servant of Isis, joyfully triumphs over fate.

Alongside the mysteries of Isis there were also mysteries of Osiris. When Lucius of Corinth arrived in Rome, he demanded a new initiation from Isis in dreams, namely: in the mysteries of the “invincible Osiris.” Shortly after, the gods demand a third initiation from Lucio, to which is linked the entry into the college of the pastóforos. Obviously it is about the mysteries of Isis and Osiris. The explanation that occurs to one, that it is in each case an initiation of a higher rank, does not find any support in the text. Perhaps each mystery community simply required a new initiation. In any case, the triple initiation is considered as a special grace of the gods and as the basis of the certainty of being a semper beatus. 


## The cult of the sovereign and the idea of ​​peace 

### 1. Background

A royalty, elevated to the category of the sacred as the top of the social pyramid, is found, as is known, in the most diverse cultures with very different traits, constituting one of the most fascinating and discussed topics in the science of religion. According to a very widespread primitive conception, the king or the leader, who is frequently both a magician or a priest, is charged with mana and is therefore the subject of multiple taboos. With the transition from the gentile organization to the centralized state organization, this representation acquires very diverse nuances, as modern research on the primitive states of Egypt and Mesopotamia has revealed. Alongside an institutionalized divine kingship, Like the one that developed very early in Egypt as a result of the unification of the Nile Valley kingdom and functioned for centuries as a powerful guarantee of state order, on an immanent basis first and transcendent later, one finds in almost all of Mesopotamia a kingship for the grace of God, with the task also of ensuring the agreement of the state order and the divine, whose holder, however, as delegate, protégé or even son of the god of the city, is clearly below the divine sphere. Underlying all this is the conception that the divine ontic order manifests itself in the king, to a certain extent, whether this order is considered something immanent to the natural and social order (to the change of the seasons of the year, to organized work and to the defense of law), whether you judge something whose decisions come from above. The Indo-European peoples also preserved ancient inherited ideas about royal charisma, which, along with other remnants of primitive religion, made themselves felt for a long time in the life and beliefs of the Greeks and Romans. It can be taken for granted that orendistic beliefs underlie the Homeric epithets of kings and heroes as frequent as god, yeios or expressions such as iere is; and to other similar ones; but all these are but fossils of a world that has disappeared, just as the ancient belief in the salutary powers of the king, that is, in the king's mana, on which the flourishing of crops, cattle and animals depends. men, has become a simile of the Odyssey in the demand for mercy and justice in the king: the magical interpretation of the world has been replaced by an ethical interpretation without the latter being able to completely displace the old conceptions. These made their way, again and again, later to the threshold of the new epoch. In classical Greece kingship had been suppressed or stripped, as in Sparta, of most of its de facto power; in Athens and elsewhere, as well as in Rome, a cultic royalty retained the priestly functions of the old patriarchal king. The relics of the sacred elements of royalty were progressively suppressed not only by political development, but very especially by that singular evolution of the logos and the autonomy of man to which we owe the classic creations of Greece. However, they subsisted, buried, irrational desires and ideas in wide strata of the population, especially in the marginal territories of Greece. The charisma that once belonged to the king was inherited by men who felt themselves to be in a peculiarly close relationship with the divinity. The name of Yeioi andres or Yeioi anthropoi was given to the singers who acted by the special grace of the divinity (they are already described in Homer as Yeioi), to the poets, to the seers and to the doctors. Incarnations of this type of individuals are Pythagoras, a sage glorified since ancient times by myth, and Empedocles, as well as the sorcerers who made the climatic conditions change, the miracle workers, mystics, poets and rational thinkers Empedocles, who seemed to update in his person the greatest possibilities of the Greek spirit, it allows us to take a look inside his soul in those fragments of him that still speak to us so eloquently. Before the Greeks of Sicily, who contemplated him entranced, he showed himself as a god and, for his part, he had a very deep knowledge of what the ties of sin and impurity mean for man. To those who expiated them, however, he opened the ascent to the gods, after the chances of the transmigration of the soul: “Finally, they will be seers and singers and doctors and princes for earthly men, from there they will rise to gods in honors the richest, sharing a home and table with the rest of the immortals without participating in human suffering, imperturbable». Empedocles endorses the ideas about the soul and the afterlife spread in the Greek world from the so-called Orphism. However, In Greek religiosity, the border between the gods, who lived eternally without problems, and men was always kept clear and clear. In a combat scene from the Iliad Diomedes, the hero of this song, attacks the Trojan Aeneas; Despite observing that Apollo keeps his hand above his head, he does not show any respect to the god. Thrice repelled by Apollo he launches himself a fourth time with superhuman strength. But then Apollo orders him to stop ”Come to your senses, go back and do not try to equal yourself to the gods, because the lineage of the gods and that of earthly men are never equal to each other. “ This warning not to indulge in hybris is a fundamental chord that was struck again and again on the strings of Greek piety. It is the same one that was found in the temple of Apollo, in Delphi: ”Know thyself “, which means ”stay within the limits that have been imposed on you “. This does not invite man to adopt a position of despondency; moreover, he only becomes fully aware of his true value when he is confronted with the gods, as happened to Diomedes on that occasion, who in fact backed down, but only ”a little. “ The Greek lived, as an individual and as a citizen of the polis, in this tense balance between proud self-awareness and recognition of its limitations. But, on the other hand, the Greeks always felt inclined to allow themselves to be overwhelmed by greatness, beauty or superhuman feats and to recognize in it the action of a divinity. In moments of mortal danger or supreme happiness, the Greek went so far as to regard his benefactor or savior as a god and worship him as such. If this must have been decisive in the motivation and in the external forms of the Hellenistic cult of the sovereign, it was also the cultic worship, sanctioned from ancient times, of the dead who in life were outstanding men. This heroic cult was not only paid to the local protective spirits and figures of myth who, like the national hero Heracles or the Dioscuri, had become true gods, but also to the founders of cities, the legislators , to the Athenian tyrannicides, to the fallen of Plataea, Marathon and Salami-na, as well as to the representatives of the old charismatic professions, such as those who mastered the art of healing, the poets and philosophers, and even the athletes. The best-known example is that of the Spartan general Brasidas, who liberated Chalcidice from Athenian rule. When he fell in 442 in front of Amphipolis, his fellow citizens immediately established in his memory a heroic cult with sacrifices and games, since they considered him as his savior (sotér). The heroization of powerful personalities had its heyday especially in Sicily during the fourth century; Dion, her liberator, may have already received ”heroic honors “ in her life. The assertion of the Hellenistic historian Duris that the Spartan Lysander was the first Greek to receive cultic honors as a god in life, barely twenty years after Brasidas, is not certain. his fellow citizens immediately established in his memory a heroic cult with sacrifices and games, since they considered him as their savior (sotér).

In general, it is known that before Alexander the Great it was always considered as a serious show of hubris when not simply something ridiculous, the deification of a living man. The Syracusan physician Menecrates, who behaved like Zeus and surrounded himself with a divine entourage made up of the patients he had cured, was regarded by his contemporaries as well as by modern research as a pathological case. All in all, we should not overlook the fact that the charisma of a thaumaturgical doctor had to find fertile ground in Sicily. The irrational forces, whose subterranean existence was perhaps perceived, were checked in metropolitan Greece by the intellectual height of the age or put at the service of rational knowledge and action. But to what extent were they aware, even the citizen masses of Athens, from the latent danger of divinization or self-divinization, is shown by Anstophanes, who returns to this motif again and again with joyous nonchalance, but not without a sense of political and religious responsibility. The sausage vendor is praised in The Knights with cult formulas such as soter de la polis. Philocleon equals Zeus and, thanks to his ascension to heaven on a dung beetle and Eirene's release, Trigeo becomes soter of men; Pistetero also experiences in the birds something similar to an apotheosis.

### 2. Alexander the Great

Although certain developments, both in the field of politics and religion, might have prepared the advent of a man of decisive greatness, this did not prevent Alexander from fundamentally breaking with the old traditions and creating something new. In his person, genuine piety and exaggerated awareness, barely tempered by irony, of one's own merits were combined in a unique way in history; the rational and the irrational, political clairvoyance and romantic enthusiasm. His homeland was Macedonia, a people of shepherds, villagers, and great feudal lords, who had always stood apart from Greekness proper and were now preparing to unify the Greek world by force of arms. The Macedonian dynasty, which could trace its origins back to Heracles and Zeus; it preserved in certain particularities a charismatic imprint. Philip, the father of Mejandro, refers to the extravagant occurrence of having added in a solemn procession his sacred image to the images of the twelve major gods; a testament to his self-esteem and his search for new forms of religious expression. Alexander's Macedonian heritage was, in this as in other respects, decisive. Burnt warrior, deeply pious, perhaps because of his contacts with Orphism; of unwavering and passionate energy, of genius only repressed by the strictest discipline and the setting of rational goals; educated by Aristotle, his teacher, after the model of the Homeric hero, ended up being a conqueror of the world and a god. The fascinating figure of him, who with such iridescent nuances appears in the tradition, constantly arouses the interest of modern research, without being able to issue a uniform judgment on his person. Among the enigmas that Alexander already posed to his contemporaries figure, above all, that of his divine affiliation or his divinity and the question of what was his personal attitude in this regard. The analysis of the old stories allows us to recognize three stages in which his personal conscience was taking shape. In the first four years of his rule until his journey to Siva's oasis he kept within the bounds of Greek and Macedonian tradition. His heroic model was Achilles, with whom he felt intimately related; Heracles, the benefactor of Greece, may also have been an encouragement to him from the start. In any case, he felt firmly included within a mythical tradition. His unwavering belief, which did not abandon him throughout his life, of being under divine protection, was shared by those around him and confirmed by multiple omens and wonders. An example is the description by Callisthenes, the official chronicler and historian of Alexander's expedition, of a march along the southern coast of Asia Minor. The south wind, which was blowing like a hurricane and made the coastal area impassable, suddenly subsided and changed direction to the north: “The sea recognized her mistress and gave her signs of respect and submission.” Alexander's highlight was the scene, still obscure to us, set in the oracular sanctuary of Ammon, in Siva's oasis, in the Libyan desert. This oracle, from the time of Pindaro, enjoyed a high prestige in the Greek world, which was further increased by the decline of the ancient cultic seats of the Greeks: their Egyptian titular god, Amun, had long been identified with Zeus. As to Alexander's motives for undertaking the weary desert march, there is disagreement between ancient accounts and modern opinion. Probably, if he addressed the oracle, it was not because he already had a firm conviction, based on religious, political and psychological reasons, of being the son of the god, nor because he hoped to confirm it with the authority of his answer, but simply because he wanted to make a consult about the future. As perhaps he had already been enthroned in Memphis as the new pharaoh, in any case, he was recognized as the legitimate ruler, on his arrival the high priest addressed him as “son of Ammon”, according to Egyptian royal terminology, or 'son of Zeus', according to the interpretatio graeca, and this must have been the decisive moment for Alexander's conscience. The formula provided a happy solution to his attempts to give mythical expression to his conviction that he was impelled by divine forces and called to perform superhuman feats. Of the answers that the oracle gave to Alexander's questions we know nothing, because he kept them to himself; the important thing was that, from then on, he considered himself a son of Ammon. With this, however, he aroused the incomprehension of the Greeks and Macedonians and provoked their ridicule in critical situations. The mythical idea of ​​a divine filiation was quite unusual as a living reality of the present moment. We only know of one predecessor of any importance in the fourth century, Clearchus, tyrant of Heracleia, who described himself as the son of Zeus and behaved accordingly. The fact that Plato was regarded shortly after his death as the son of Apollo (and before anyone else as Speusippus, his nephew and successor) is not a revealing indication of a general mentality, but rather of the mystical mood of the academy, impressed perhaps because of the legend of Pythagoras. Alexander was moving on a path that only the Greeks, let alone the Macedonians, could reluctantly follow. He evidently was determined to see himself and his great triumphal campaign under the aspect of the mythical, without, however, underestimating the true political import of the myth of divine filiation. To what extent was he impressed in this by external influences - for example,

As a second stage, a mere episode appears in the tradition. That Alexander demanded proskynesis from his Macedonian and Greek followers, a common humiliation in the court of the Great King, perhaps it was more of a protocol or political measure with a view to the unification of the Empire. The Greeks, however, reacted sensitively and rejected this oriental act that hurt their sense of freedom and human dignity, to the point that Alexander had to desist from his proposal. The last step was taken in 324, when on his return from India he demanded that the Greeks officially recognize him as a god, that is, that they include him in the number of the gods of the polis; last and logical sequel of the attitude maintained by him until now and of the mythical world of his experiences. The reaction of the Greeks cannot be described as enthusiastic. Athens, where we can get some overview of the discussion this gave rise to, joined the proposal for opportunistic reasons; a cultic image and sacrifice was granted to the 'invincible god', but shortly after his death the agreement was revoked. On the contrary, in the Greek cities of Asia Minor, a local cult of Alexander with solemn games was maintained until the Roman Empire, although unfortunately we do not know exactly when it was established. The opposition of the Greeks of Europe was surely due, in part, to the remoteness of the new “god” and to the erroneous ideas that had been formed of its successes, its durability and its revolutionary meaning, but above all to the tenacious resistance to Macedonian rule. The Athenian decree provides a good example of the misuse that can be made of religious forms as a political instrument, emptying them of content. Indeed, throughout the entire history of the cult of the sovereign in Antiquity, there was the dilemma that although it was possible at any time to transfer men, whose greatness could not be disregarded, the ideas and forms of expression consecrated by the divine worship, stripping them of their genuine meaning and of their religious demands, there was, instead, the continuous danger that these, by degrading into farce or petrifying into an institution, would not be taken seriously and would become trivial. wrapping of the simple loyalty of the subjects. Also inherent in the cult of the sovereign since Alexander was the intimate contradiction between the spontaneous cult from below and the ordered and organized 'from above'. Alexander's wish to be buried next to his father Ammon was not fulfilled, but he was also unable to find a burial place in the pantheon of the Macedonian kings in Aigai. Ptolemy seized his corpse and had it buried, first in Memphis, and lastly in Alexandria. With this decision one of the capital milestones of the imperialist policy of the Hellenistic world is marked. In Alexandria, where Heros ktistes (founder) of its foundation was already, Alexander received a state cult as a deceased god, with an eponymous priesthood, attested as early as 311. Only from then does his effigy appear on coins adorned with the horns of Ammon. From now on it is possible to read in the effigies of the coins the history of the cult of the sovereign and of the ideas that determined it. The representations of the gods receive the features of the portrait of the king, or the image of the king is enriched with attributes and symbols of a god: Zeus, Apollo, Poseidon, Heracles, Dionysus. In the artistic effigies of coinage, the central power had an all-pervasive and effective means of propagating and affirming the notion of sacred kingship. Along with them, the monuments and the numerous votive, honorific and priestly inscriptions are of special importance to us. Alexander gave the rulers of the ancient world, for half a millennium after his death, the example of sacral sublimation, although ideas and forms were frequently and substantially modified. What was not given to Alexander in life became a reality after his death: the development of a myth based above all on the legend of his birth, thanks to which he could be made a true son of god. The tales of fantasy were imagined on the model of Alexander's triumphal expedition to India like a Dionysus in a succession of enthusiastic parties. The Alexander myth passed into world literature through the so-called Alexander novel in an Egyptian-influenced form in which there is otherwise no trace of his proper divine kingship.

### 3. Hellenism

The Diadochos practiced, with a view to their own prestige, the cult of the deceased king; only Antipater in Macedon refrained from it in any significant way. At the same time, the Greek cities promoted in an official way the honors to the living successor, which at first were granted voluntarily. With them, the cities that only conserved a formal autonomy expressed their political loyalty to the sovereign of the day. But there always had to be a concrete reason for gratitude. The forms were, without exception, those of divine worship: cult images, temples, sacrifices, priesthoods, agons, processions (pompai), birth commemorations, the denomination of tribes and months with the name of the sovereign and the concession to him of epithets and cult names, such as Soter, originally an epithet of gods such as Zeus, Apollo or Asclepius, but who designated the political “savior” and “protector” since the end of the 5th century; Euergetes, a cult term with political nuances, including Theos, a religious name that the true gods did not need at all, including naturally Alexander. But it was never forgotten that it was only “honours proper to the gods.” Consequently, sovereigns were not made “gods” but were equated with Olympians for political reasons, with a spatial and temporal limitation that excluded absolute divinity. Characteristic acts of this type were the decree of the city of Scepsis in the Troas in honor of Antigonus Monophthalmus (311-310), that he had assured the Greeks freedom and autonomy and the celebrated honors repeatedly bestowed by the Athenians on their “liberator” Demetrius the Polyorcete and his father, Antigonus. At the spot where the latter alighted from the chariot on his first entry into Athens in 307, an altar to Demetrius Kataibates, commonly an epithet for Zeus, the heavenly god who descended on the thunderbolt, was erected; in 304-303 the epistodome of the Parthenon was assigned to him as a dwelling; but the culmination of all this was the triumphant reception that was given to him in 291-290, conceived and organized as the epiphany of a god, with a famous cult song sung by all the citizens (Athens, in the meantime, had betrayed him and she tried with all her might to reconcile with him). The cult song of yore, studied multiple times,

From the honors granted by the Greek communities, it is necessary to separate the obligatory state cult for all subjects, which was organized, approximately from 280, in all the Hellenistic States. It was started in Egypt by Ptolemy II, who had previously erected a magnificent tomb for Alexander and established a cult for his parents, Ptolemy I and Berenice, the theoi Soteres. Also important was the procession organized in Alexandria around 270 with enormous pageantry, in which not only the other gods with Alexander appeared in the middle of a Dionysian group, but also the Soteres. It was a trait of skill on the part of Ptolemy II to introduce the state cult of the living sovereign in solidarity with the cult of Alexander, long sanctioned in Alexandria. Whether the establishment of the cult of the theoi Adelphoi (271-270) took place shortly before or shortly after the death of his wife Arsinoe is a question that still remains. Since then, then, there was a state cult, with an eponymous priesthood, to Alexander and the theoi Adelphoi, to which successive royal couples were later added; Ptolemy IV Philopator included in this dynasty cult the theoi Soteres. In addition, many queens had their own priestesses: Cleopatra III came to gather five priesthoods, since, apart from receiving worship as “Isis, Great Mother of the gods”, she also received it as Aphrodite (an assimilation that was always easy for them). women of the Hellenistic dynasties). Here the influence of Egyptian notions and forms is noticed. The poetry of the time adopts in the face of these phenomena, to whom he outwardly bows in reverence, a posture not without subtle irony. A good example of this “court poetry” is the idyll of Theocritus dedicated to Ptolemy II. In the kingdom of the Seleucids, the state cult of the sovereign served to give a symbolic coherence to the satrapies of motley ethnic, cultural and religious composition. Different was the case of the kingdom of the Atálidás whose capital Pergamon was an ancient Greek cultural center; here the living ruler did not become a god, but received “godlike honors”; in a hyperbolic way, the last sovereign, Attalus III (138-133). The dead sovereign metastasised into the sky. There were games and priests of the Attalids in many places in the Greek territory. Among the multiple phenomena of the marginal areas of the Hellenistic world, it is worth mentioning only Mithridates VI Eupator of Pontus, champion of the East against Rome. The masses of Asia Minor enthusiastically celebrated him as a new Alexander and a Neos Dionysos, a brief flare of hopes of salvation and expectations of Greco-Oriental epiphanies.

### 4. Roma

With their penetration into the eastern basin of the Mediterranean, the Romans entered the sphere of the Hellenistic cult of the sovereign. Its magistrates, beginning with Flamininus, were accorded in the Greek East honors which had long been conventional there. It still took Cicero an effort of will to repel them. On the other hand, the Greeks very early created the goddess Roma as a personification of the Roman state; the oldest temple of her had it in Smyrna from 195 a. C. With this, the external forms of the later cult of the Emperor were already established in the essential for the East. Very different were the budgets existing in Rome, Italy and in the western provinces. The notion of divine filiation and epiphany was almost non-existent in Roman religion. But nonetheless, charismatic notions abounded in her. Such were, for example, those embedded in the republican magistracy (with its double aspect of auspicium and imperium); in the triumph, during which the victorious general put on the robes of Jupiter, and above all in the genius (originally of a demon protector of the male and of the paterfamilias linked to the sexual function) and in the felicitas, of which César he could boast and already carried Sula Felix in his cognomen. Such 'abstractions', which for the Romans retained their numinous character well into the imperial age, served as a starting point for Caesar and Augustus in their attempt to give religious sanction to their position within the state. Certainly, both of them were, through and through, rationalistic politicians, but they had a certain instinct for the Roman imponderables. Intensive propaganda, repeatedly confronting us on coins, also brought ancient Roman beliefs into play. The symbolism of Romulus, so frequently used, was used to create the feeling of a “new Romulus” (be it Sula, Pompey or Caesar) and to announce the beginning of a new era of happiness, like the one with the mythical king of the Origins. The yearning for peace and a better time in the world, increasingly widespread during the century of civil wars, found its symbols in the primitive Etruscan and Roman notions of saeculum, in the Greek cult of Ktistes and Euergetes, and also in Egyptian, Babylonian, and Persian redemption expectations. The most famous testimony to this is the enigmatic IV Virgilian Eclogue, dating from the year 40. Caesar behaved with a very un-Roman spontaneity in order to make himself tolerable to the reactionary aristocracy; he fell under the daggers of the conspirators, even though the Senate and the people had already awarded him honors similar to those of the gods, as a Hellenistic sovereign. His death and his burial caused a deep shock in the masses, which was vented in spontaneous acts of worship. Caesar was officially included in the year 42 as divus lulius among the gods of the State (this event was the prototype of the imperial apotheosis of later times) and his adopted son, the young Caesar, could be called divi filius, which, if in its translation The Greek name of Teos sios could arouse associations of the greatest scope, it also conferred, in the Roman conception of the name, a special charisma on its bearer. In the conflict between him and Antony the Roman national components were distinguished most clearly (underlined by an intense propaganda war), in the notion of Caesar's divine kingship, from the Hellenistic-Oriental ones. In his union with Cleopatra, who pretended to present himself as both Isis and Aphrodite, Antony presented himself as an epiphany of Dionysus, the dispenser of happiness, or of Osiris, making himself worshiped with solemnities and enthusiastic parties. The Athenians had bad taste enough to offer Athena Parthenos as their wife; Antonio accepted the proposal and claimed a dowry of a thousand talents. In the case of Antony and Cleopatra, the Hellenistic deification of the human being reached decadent excesses of cynicism. On the contrary, young Caesar, driven by the hopes and love of his people, it became a symbol of Roman sobriety. Mars Ultor, the avenger of the murderers of his father; Venus genetrix, the mother of the Julia house lineage, and Apollo were his patron deities. He always scrupulously avoided assimilating himself to any divinity. In none of his coins was he represented with divine attributes. However, in the years following the victory at Actium he tried to find a valid formula to sanctify his position. From the year 30 he allowed a libation to be made at all banquets, even private ones, to his person or rather to his genius. The following year he was included in the cult song of the Salians. In January 27 he came up with the final formula for the new state organization and the position of the Prince. He received the cognomen of Augustus, a word of the cult language that denoted the sacred elevation (cf. augere, augur; with resonances also from the augustum augurium of Romulus) and that was translated into Greek with the term of Sebastos. Successive honors also moved within the charismatic sphere, but they avoided deification itself. Its culmination was reached in the year 2 AD. C. with the solemn epithet of pater patriae, the honorary title appropriate to the savior of calamities and the conservator and protector of the State. At the same time, we observe the consolidation and diffusion of the provincial cult promoted from the highest spheres. The Emperor first gave his approval in the year 29 to the erection at Ephesus and Nicaea of ​​temples consecrated to Rome and to the divus Iulius; that is, an element of the Hellenistic tradition coupled with the state cult of the late Caesar. Simultaneously, non-citizens of both provinces (Asia and Bithynia) were allowed to create cult centers for the living Caesar in Pergamon, in Nicomedia, although in them Augustus was associated -as in the rest of the Empire- with the goddess Roma. After 27 the temples of Rome and Augustus became widespread in all the eastern parts of the Empire; for example, in Athens, on the Acropolis. But this cult also spread in the West, where that tradition did not exist, becoming an important link in the unity of the Empire, while in Rome and Italy the cult of the genius Augusti and his Lares ceased to be a cult. popular household and family to become a municipal variety of Emperor worship. To the skill of a religious policy, which put living forms of worship at the service of the religion of loyalty,He actively avoided intervention in the multiple tasks of the cult of the lower classes and freedmen. Very soon, once again, as an institution of its own specific weight, a new cult of the sovereign was instituted, only supported by an even broader base than in the kingdom of the Ptolemies. But in the case of Augustus there were also genuine religious concerns and feelings of gratitude. Like no other sovereign of the ancient Mediterranean world, he had brought, after calamities and miseries, peace, assuring it for a long time. A choir of many different voices expresses hope and joy at the advent of a new saeculum. The policy of Augustus knew how to create effective symbols for this: the closure of the temple of Janus, the secular festival of the year 17, the altar Pacis Augustae (consecrated in the year 11). Virgil, Tibullus and Propertius proclaim the blessings of peace. In the East, the most profound testimony of gratitude known to us is the so-called decree of the Kalendas of Priene, which must be read in the original, together with the Halicarnassus inscription. Here the notion of the savior of the world is transferred to Augustus, as he had already happened before to Caesar. In such manifestations one notices, beneath the rhetorical litter, a spontaneous sentiment. When Augustus died in 14 AD. C., his ascension to heaven was something that the credulity of broad popular sectors took for granted. The Senate officially decreed and promulgated the apotheosis, once a witness claimed, under oath, to have seen with his own eyes Caesar's heavenly ascension. The later consecrations of the Emperors were conditioned to a ceremony that seems strange to us. It was always the Senate that decided upon the death of the Emperor in power the admission of him among the divi or his damnatio memoriae. It was thought, in the Roman way, that only virtus had opened the way to the heaven of the gods. The moderate attitude of Augustus, scrupulously maintained also by Tiberius, was not, however, binding for long. The institutions of the cult of the Emperor were progressively transformed into the expression, extended to ever larger sectors, of sentiment, with hints of religiosity, of belonging to the Empire. The attitude of the various Emperors did not fundamentally alter the symbolic importance of the cult of the Emperor for the loyalty and belief in the eternity of the Roman Empire; neither the skepticism of a Vespasian, who escaped from his deathbed that vae, puto deus fio, nor the delusions of grandeur of a Caligula, who took his role as figurehead dangerously seriously, as if he were the very incarnation of Olympus. Domitian's attempt to impose an absolute kingship of divine character was a mere episode; but, nevertheless, the tendency to progressively surround the Emperor in all his manifestations with a religious halo was felt even in the liberal Emperors. In the late Empire this current, increasingly mighty, finally converged in the Christian conception of the Emperor by the grace of God. that he took his figurehead role dangerously seriously, as if he were the very embodiment of Olympus.

Without a doubt, the ancient cult of the sovereign operated more in extension than in depth. The mass of extant material in inscriptions, coins, temples, altars, statues, hymns, and literary documents can hardly be encompassed, even today. Private dedications are not lacking either. But in general there were very few who professed a genuine religious sentiment. No prayers were addressed to these new gods, but rather they were prayed for, as even the Jews did. The attitude of the intellectuals, in what was not determined by the desire to save, by servility, the skin (in the most abject form under Domitian), was entirely negative, either for reasons of a rational or political nature, or by an intact feeling of religious reverence. The frivolous game that emperors like Caligula and Nero played with the divine must, of course, have revolted many people. Since the time of Alexander, anecdotes and jokes circulated about the pretended divinity of the sovereigns. Certain great personalities were granted the entire charisma of the ruler and were, at the same time, the object of veneration, worship and myth. But otherwise primitive notions also appear occasionally and in the most unexpected way, such as, for example, expecting and receiving from the Emperors the healing of diseases. Here we see the intervention, as in the notion of the savior of the world, of Eastern ideas. But neither Alexander, nor Caesar, nor his successors succeeded in founding again a true divine kingship. The different forms of worship,


**JESUS** 

# Salvin. But what name is this? 

In some parts of my novel about Jesus[^1] he appears named as “Salvin”. This name is actually taken from _The Urantia Book_, where we find all kinds of new expositions about the divine personality of Jesus. 

The old and eternal discussion about the divinity of Jesus is a recurring theme throughout the centuries. Early Christian communities soon began to worship Jesus as a god, or even more, as God himself. This ended up leading to the idea of ​​the Holy Trinity, a complex idea according to which God, being a single being, had three personalities or manifestations, one the Father, another the Son, and another the Holy Spirit. Obviously, Jesus was identified with the Son, the second personality.

This idea, which became popular long after the death of Jesus, ended up establishing itself as the Christian explanation of the divinity of Jesus, although it received innumerable criticisms and provoked bitter theological confrontations. 

On May 20, 325, in Nicaea, the Emperor Constantine convened a council of bishops to try, among other things, to stop the influence of the doctrines of an Alexandrian priest named Arius, who questioned the divinity of Jesus. 

The idea of ​​the Holy Trinity as it was raised by early Christianity advocated that the divinity only exists in three personalities. Outside of these three persons, there is no divinity.

_The Urantia Book_ launches a new consideration: divinity is a quality shared by many beings in the created universe, not just by three people ([UB 0:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_1), [UB 0:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_2), [UB 0:1.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_18)). This new vision establishes degrees within the divinity, which we can also assimilate with “degrees of perfection.”

According to _The Urantia Book_ Jesus is a being with divinity capabilities ([UB 4:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_4), [UB 37:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p0_1)). He is a god to all intents and purposes. But not God in the absolute sense. Like early Christianity, _The Urantia Book_ establishes only three persons as the absolutes of divinity, beings who comprise all possible perfection of Deity. But unlike ancient Christianity, Jesus does not appear as the absolute second member of the Trinity ([UB 33:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p1_2)), but as an extraordinary and unknown type of being called Michael or Creator Son ([UB 21:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p0_3), [UB 32:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p0_3)).

Michaels are gods in the strict sense, there are thousands upon thousands of them ([UB 21:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/21#p1_4)), and they are capable of creating physical formations in the universe and endowing the planets. From this perspective, Michael beings like Jesus should come naturally to us as the totality of divinity. But according to _The Urantia Book_, on a higher cosmic level, they are only the representatives of the three absolute persons of Deity.

In _The Urantia Book_ the physical formation created by Jesus is called Nebadon ([UB 0:0.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_5), [UB 1:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p2_9)). And its center, in which is the heavenly abode of Jesus, is called Salvington ([UB 15:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p7_7)). This last name gives the feeling of being an adaptation to English of a word in another language that meant “the city of Salvin” (“Salvin town”). The word Salvin seems chosen because it reminds of “salvation”.

If we take into account that the authentic Aramaic name of Jesus, which is vocalized as Yeshua, meant “Yahweh saves” or “Salvation”, it becomes clearer why I have used “Salvin” as the celestial name of Jesus throughout my novel. The basic idea is that probably the authentic celestial name of Jesus, of unknown pronunciation, also means “Salvation” in the celestial language. This is why Jesus' capital of creation is named “the city of salvation” in _The Urantia Book_, and why (there may be an explanation here) Jesus chose for himself a human name that meant the same as his heavenly name. (Entrusting Gabriel during the announcement to Mary to request that name for him).

This name does not appear in _The Urantia Book_, and is a simple invention of mine based on other names, as already explained. Therefore, it should be taken as something curious, but nothing more. In fact, _The Urantia Book_ does not seem to want to give the divine Jesus a name, limiting itself to say that Jesus is the Michael (that is, of the order of Creator Sons) with number 611,121, or simply, the Michael of Nebadon ([UB 33:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/33#p1_1)). The use of Salvin instead of Michael arises from considering the idea that creators like Jesus must have more personality to have a proper name and not a simple number.

Michael is also a Jewish name meaning “He who is like God” or “Who but God?”. In Jewish angelic mythology he frequently appeared as one of the great angels or archangels, alongside Gabriel, Raphael and Fanuel. In pre-Christian literature, as in Revelation, he appears with a transcendental importance: he is the one who has the great contest with the beast that personifies the Devil ([Rev 12:7](/en/Bible/Revelation/12#v7)). 

As I show in my novel, there is a possible explanation for the new interest that the figure of the archangel Michael aroused in early Christianity. But that should be the subject of another paper.

# Yeshua ben Yosef

We are so accustomed to calling the Master “Jesus” that we forget that in the language that he used in his time his true name, correctly vocalized, would sound just as this other name is pronounced: “Yeshua ben Yosef.” 

In Hebrew Yeshua means “Salvation” or “Yahweh saves”, and is a contraction of Yahoshua, which means “The Lord who is Salvation”. However, Jesus does not have any meaning in Spanish or in the rest of the Latin or Anglo-Saxon languages. In this sense, the Hebrew names, in the style of the names of other peoples, had a meaning, and very often, this meaning was religious.

There are many Yeshuas throughout the Bible, but these names tend to be confused with different vocalizations to make the name “Jesus” seem unique and original. However, the name of the Master was one of the most common names of the time and of earlier times. Jesú, Jesuá and Joshua are three ways of using the same name as Jesus. 

The name Yeshua appears 29 times in the Law and the Prophets. For example, Yehoshua (Joshua) ben Nun is called Yeshua in Nehemiah (Neh 8:17). Yeshua is the name of the high priest (_kôhen gadôl_) in the time of Zerubbabel (Ezra 3:2). He is also the name of a Levite in the reign of Hezekiah (2 Chr 31:15).

To get from «Yeshua» to obtain Jesus, two transliterations have taken place. First when Yeshua was translated into Greek as Iesous. And from the Greek when translated into Latin as Iesus. The initial “I” or “Y” sound ended up being forced into Old Castilian by passing to “J”.

Actually the written Aramaic Yeshua lacks vowels. These are added to form Aramaic phonemes, but the correct vowel is difficult to determine. Yeshua written in Aramaic is made up of the letters yod, shin, final nun and ayin. These consonants sounded as follows: yod as our “y”, shin as a “sh” (“long s”), final nun as a “u”, and ayin as an “h” (a guttural sound that was optional to pronounce). and of which only the chosen vowel remained, usually «a» or «e», and placed in front). This means that without vowels it would sound like yshuh, but adding the appropriate vowels would sound like yeshuah or yoshuah or yoshueh. Vowels were not important, so different districts might tend to use one and the other. Perhaps hence the explanation that Pedro was recognized by his «Galilean accent» during his denials.

Where does the final “s” of “Jesus” come from? A possible explanation lies in the Greek custom of making masculine names end very frequently with “s”. 

And the last name? How were the different Jesuses of the time distinguished from each other? The usual thing was to use the father's name as a surname, writing “bar” or “ben” in between, “son of”. For example, Barrabás is actually a nickname that means “Bar Abba” (Son of his father). In the case of Jesus, his full name would be “Yeshua ben Yosef” (Jesus son of Joseph).

What if there was more than one son and father with the same name? In that case, whatever was needed was continued throughout the paternal genealogy. The Jews were very fond of boasting of racial purity by listing their ancestors going back several dozen generations. This made it possible to prove a Jewish legitimacy. The bastards or the children born of non-Jewish unions tainted all descendants for generations and generations, so that they were left out of the privileges of the “authentic Jews.” The reality, however, was that almost all Jews had some crossing at some point in their ancestry, but everyone covered up these black spots on their family trees by paying large sums to the scribes, who falsified all kinds of documents in which official ancestry was recorded. This makes it easier to understand why these strange genealogies of Jesus are offered in the Gospels (Mt 1:1-17, Lk 3:23-38). His objective is to ensure the legitimacy and Jewish purity of Jesus against those who denied him a Jewish fatherhood in order to discredit him.

The Romans, on the contrary, less interested in these genealogical questions, used to refer to their subjects by the place of origin. That is why Pontius Pilate placed a tablet with the name “Jesus of Nazareth” on top of the cross. 

Taking all of this into account, I have tried to have Jesus named in the story with different names similar to Yeshua depending on the place and the people who spoke with him. 


Finally, an image of how the four letters of Yeshua were written in Aramaic. To read, it is convenient to keep in mind that Aramaic and Hebrew, like Arabic, were written from right to left.

# The Jesus Family

Very little is known about the family of Jesus, that is, the brothers and sisters of his parents and grandparents. There is practically no trace in the gospels, and the mentions of the first Christians are not very numerous either. This has come to build an anomalous idea of ​​the life of Jesus, imagining him as a boy who grew up with hardly any family contact except for his parents. But this view does not seem to agree with the numerous parables in which Jesus used family relationships to express his teachings, and which were surely drawn from his own personal experience. 

But what can we know about his family according to the gospels? 

> Matthan fathered Jacob. And Jacob begat Joseph, the husband of Mary, from whom was born Jesus, called Messiah. [Mt 1:16]

According to Matthew the paternal grandfather of Jesus was called Jacob and his great-grandfather Matán, but this does not agree with the text of Luke. 

> When Jesus began ministry, he was about thirty years old and, in the opinion of the people, he was the son of Joseph. These are his ancestors: Heli, Matat... [Lk 3:23] 

Luke mentions a certain Heli as paternal grandfather and Matat as great-grandfather. The null coincidence between the two evangelists casts doubt on the reliability of both. 

> Jesus was still speaking to the people, when his mother and his brothers arrived. [Mt 12:46] 

> Isn't this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called his Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Aren't all his sisters among us? [Mt 13:55]

> His mother and brothers arrived and, from outside, they sent for him. [Mk 3:31] 

> Then his mother and his brothers showed up, but they couldn't get to Jesus because of the crowd. [Lk 8:19] His 

brothers are mentioned to us (brothers by blood or stepbrothers according to different theories), but never accompanied by other relatives but only by his mother. 

> James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddeus [Mt 10:3] 

> James the son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus [Mk 3:18] 

> James, the son of Alphaeus, Simon called Zelota, Judas the son of James [Lk 6 :15] 

> Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to assist him, watched the scene from afar. Among them were Mary Magdalene and Mary, the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the Zebedeans. [Mt 27:56]

> Some women watched the scene from afar. Among them Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James the Less and of Joseph, and Salome [Mk 15:40] 

> Next to the cross of Jesus were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene. [Jn 19:25] 

These James the younger and Joseph tend to be identified with the two brothers of Jesus mentioned in Mt 13:55. But it is convenient to analyze the passages to realize that it does not make sense. If so, the “Mary, the mother of James and Joseph” would be referring to the mother of Jesus, and then Mark 15:40 would be more appropriate to say “Mary the mother of Jesus.”

As we can see, the references to relatives of Jesus are very few. We are only mentioned to a Mary, sister of his mother, and therefore Jesus' aunt, in Jn 19:25. But this reference looks like a corruption. How is it possible that the mother of Jesus had a sister with the same name as her? No father, for practical and obvious reasons, would give two daughters the same name. How to reconcile this? In my opinion, the text of Jn 19:25 is a corruption that should be translated by 

> Next to the cross of Jesus were his mother, his mother's sister-in-law, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene. 

That is to say that this Mary was actually the wife of a brother of Mary named Cleopas.

References to another Mary who has been identified by many scholars as the mother of Jesus' two brothers also contain corruptions and are misconstrued, in my opinion. This Mary, who has nothing to do with the previous one, is the mother of two apostles named Tadeo and Lebeo (Thaddeus and Lebbaeus). That it has nothing to do with the former Mary is shown by the fact that one of them, named James, is said to be the son of Alphaeus, and the other, named Judas, is said to be the son of James. Therefore nothing to do with Cleofás.

But the references that appear in the gospels of these two characters are contradictory. One is constantly called James, saying that he is the son of Alphaeus. Mentioning the name of the father here makes a lot of sense if we consider that we have another James among the apostles, the son of Zebedee. The father's name, therefore, as was the Jewish custom, served as a surname to distinguish namesakes. But the mentions of the other apostle, which are always made after the first, are all different. This apostle is called Tadeo and Judas the son of Santiago (and it may be that in Mt 27:56 and Mk 15:40 he is being called Joseph if we imagine that the one who was at the foot of the cross was his mother).

In any case, it does not seem that these James and Judas Tadeo can be identified with the two brothers of Jesus who at the beginning of Christianity obtained so much fame, and of whom letters are preserved in the New Testament. It is not understood that if Jesus had brothers among his apostles, the evangelists mention them asking to be received by him (Mt 12:46, Mk 3:31 and Lk 8:19). On the other hand, the “brother of Jesus” James was nicknamed “the Just”, while in these passages he is nicknamed “the youngest”. Furthermore, if he had been the brother of Jesus, his father would have been Joseph, and not Alphaeus, as we are here told.

Given this panorama of ignorance, there is no other alternative than to go to other literature to obtain more information about the relatives of Jesus. And one book that provides us with a lot of answers is _The Urantia Book_. That is, as long as we are willing to grant this book the credibility of being a revelation. 

## What does _The Urantia Book_ say about the relatives of Jesus? 

> On the return trip, María visited her parents, Joaquín and Ana. Her two brothers, her two sisters and her parents considered the divine mission of Jesus with skepticism, although of course at that time they knew nothing of the Gabriel's Visitation But Maria did confide in her sister Salome that she believed her son was destined to be a great teacher. [UB 122:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p3_3)

> (José) In his youth, living with his eight brothers and sisters. [UB 122:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_1) 

> A short time later they moved into his new house in Nazareth, which had been built by Joseph with the help of two of his brothers. [UB 122:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_9) 

> Most of Joseph's family became believers in the teachings of Jesus, but very few of Mary's relatives believed in him until after his death. departure from this world. [UB 122:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_10) 

> Building and furnishing the house had been a large expense for Joseph who also had to contribute to support his parents, since his father had been disabled little time before. [UB 122:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p7_4)

> They arrived unannounced at the house in Nazareth, occupied for more than three years by one of Joseph's married brothers. He this one showed great surprise when seeing them; [UB 123:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_1) 

> It was in the middle of the summer of this same year that José built a small workshop near the town's fountain and the lot where the caravans stopped. From then on he did very little carpentry work a day. He had as partners two of his brothers and several other workers, whom he sent to work outside of him while he remained in the workshop making plows, yokes and other wooden objects. [UB 123:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_6)

> (Mary) dressed her two children and fled with them to her brother's country house, several kilometers south of Nazareth, on the Megiddo road near Sarid. They did not return to Nazareth for more than two months; Jesus thoroughly enjoyed this his first experience on a farm. [UB 123:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p1_7) 

> In June of this year Joseph handed over his workshop in Nazareth to his brothers. [UB 123:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_7) 

> (Jesus) did his homework so well that he was allowed one week of vacation per month. He usually spent that week with his uncle the fisherman on the shores of the Sea of ​​Galilee near Magdala, or on the farm of his other uncle (his mother's brother) five miles south of Nazareth. [UB 123:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p6_1)

It seems that the text mentions the uncle of Jesus of Magdala as if he were the brother of Joseph, his father. Hence the expression “his mother's brother” for Sarid's other uncle. 

> An uncle of his had already taken over the family grocery store. [UB 126:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p5_8) 

> During this entire year Jesus could hardly ever leave his workbench. [UB 127:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p1_6) 

> One of Jesus' uncles (Simon, Mary's brother) had already joined the [nationalist] group, eventually becoming an officer of the the Galilean division, which led to a certain estrangement between Jesus and his uncle for several years. [UB 127:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_4)

As we have seen in the previous passage, Jesus seems to have stayed for a whole year in Nazareth. It is mentioned that his uncle, Simon, brother of Maria, who had become a zealot, urged him to join the group. If Jesus could not go to Magdala or Sarid for a year, then the zealot uncle would have to live in Nazareth and be a different uncle than the previous two. 

> Jesús' position was made even more difficult because his mother, his uncle and even his younger brother Santiago urged him to embrace the nationalist cause. [UB 127:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_7)

> Before the harvest, he took Judah to visit his farmer uncle who lived south of Nazareth; but Judah did not stay long after the harvest, but he ran away from his uncle's farm. A short time later he found Simon living with the fishermen on the lake. When Simon brought him back home, Jesus had a conversation with the runaway boy and, since he wanted to be a fisherman, he took him to Magdala, handing him over to the custody of a relative who was a fisherman. [UB 128:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p7_8)

> Next to the cross were Mary, Ruth, Judah, Salome (John's mother), and a group of women, sincere believers, who included Mary, Cleopas's wife and the sister of John's mother, at different times during the crucifixion. Jesus, Mary Magdalene, and Rebekah, formerly of Sepphoris. [UB 187:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_2) 

> The women thus standing at the tomb this Friday night were: Mary Magdalene; Mary the wife of Cleopas; Marta, another sister of the mother of Jesus, and Rebekah of Sepphoris. [UB 188:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p1_7) 

The conclusions we draw are:

As for María's family, her parents were named Joaquín and Ana, and she had two brothers and two sisters. One of her brothers, anonymous, lived near Sarid and therefore Nazareth on a farm (he is the uncle of Jesus who we could call “farmer”, and from whom Jesus derived all his agricultural knowledge). Another of the brothers is Simon, from Nazareth, who was an important leader of the Zealots in Galilee, and encouraged Jesus to join the cause. As for the two sisters, one named Salome is mentioned to us in [UB 122:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p3_3), and the other named Martha is mentioned to us in [UB 188:1.7](/ en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p1_7). Therefore, it does not fit that another Mary, wife of Cleopas, is spoken of as sister of Mary in [UB 187:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p3_2). But neither does it make much sense to interpret again in _The Urantia Book_, as in the gospels, a corruption of “sister” by “sister-in-law” or sister-in-law, because that would mean that the anonymous “farmer” brother is none other than Cleofás . So why doesn't he mention him by his name when he talks about him in [UB 123] (/en/The_Urantia_Book/123)?

One possible explanation is that the mention “His two brothers, his two sisters” in [UB 122:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p3_3) does not refer to all of his brothers, but to those who lived in Nazareth (let us remember that one lived in Sarid, outside of Nazareth), so the number of brothers and sisters would have to be expanded to an indefinite number in which this Cleofás could enter. Another possible explanation is that when Jesus was born his mother had only four brothers and sisters, but later Mary had new sisters or brothers, so Jesus would have aunts or uncles younger than him.

The explanation that “Mary, wife of Cleofás” is a corruption of “Marta, wife of Cleofás”, so that Cleofás is actually Mary's brother-in-law, does not apply to us because in [UB 188:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p1_7) the two sisters of Mary are mentioned to us. Moreover, here we are explicitly told: “Martha, another sister of the mother of Jesus.” This, said after having designated Mary the wife of Cleopas as Mary's sister, leaves no room for doubt. They were two different people and both were sisters of Mary.

All this only leaves us as options: either that it is a corruption for “sister-in-law” and Cleofás is Sarid's brother, or that María actually had another sister named María and therefore the number of her brothers was at least five and not four. , although there were four who lived in the vicinity of Nazareth. 

As for Joseph's family, we are not told the names of his parents, but we do know that Joseph had eight brothers and sisters. At least two lived in Nazareth ([UB 122:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p5_9)). One mentions to us that he took over the family grocery store. Jesus' uncle, who was a fisherman and lived near Magdala, I think he was another of Joseph's brothers, although we have already seen that assigning only two brothers to Mary might not be entirely correct.

## Leaving the imagination to act 

In short, despite using _The Urantia Book_ as a credible source, we still do not have enough information to get a sufficient idea of ​​the number of uncles and aunts that Jesus had, especially in Nazareth, much less of his male and female cousins, who surely had many. 

So what I'm going to do here is offer a completely fabricated version, albeit based on all the data I have, of what Jesus' entire family could have been like. This family is the one that will later be glimpsed in the story of «Jesus of Nazareth». 

### The family of José 

Jacob and Raquel, grandparents of Jesus, had as children José, Jonás, Amós, Janai, Simón, Juana, Miriam, Ruth, Marta, and these are their families:

*Joseph married Mary (see below). 
* Jonah, from Nazareth, was Joseph's associate carpenter in his shop, and later took over the supply store. He married Sunah and they had: Jonás, Obén, Sera, Rejina. 
* Amos, from Nazareth, was the one who occupied the house of Joseph on his return from Egypt. He associated with José in the carpentry workshop, and later he owned this workshop. He married María and they had: Jacob, Juan, Manaél, Jesuá, Mirna and María. 
* Janai married Yenoah and they had: Simon, David, Jesus, Janai, Rachel, Mary and Elizabeth. 
* Simon (fisherman from Magdala) married Seraj and they had no children. 
* Juana married Jebod and they had: Judas, Jebod, Josí, Ana and Susana. 
* Miriam married Eleazar and they had: Elías, María and Ana.
* Ruth died shortly before getting married. 
* Martha died a few years before Jesus, single. 

### The family of María 

Joaquín and Ana, grandparents of Jesus, had as children: Simón, Joatán, María, Mariah, Salomé and Marta, and these are their families: 

* Simón, from Nazareth, who became a zealot and was a prominent leader of the nationalists in Galilee, married Ainar and they had: Joaquín, Jesús, Jacob, Judas and Esther. 
* Joathan, who moved to live on a farm in the country near Sarid, south of Nazareth, married Jerusa and had: Eleazar, Jonathan, Joseph, Serod, Mariah, and Shua. 
* Mary married Joseph (see below).
* Mariah, who was born after Jesus, married Cleofás, they both lived in Nazareth and had: Joán, Fasael, Nida, María, Marta, Ruth, Esther and Alejandra. 
* Marta married Juan and they had: Josim, Rubén, Jesús, María, Rebeca and Isabel. 
* Salomé was single all her life and took care of her mother Ana. 

### José and María's family 

José and María had, besides Jesus, Santiago, Simón, José, Judas or Juda, Amós, Marta, Miriam and Ruth, and these are their families:

* Santiago married around November of the year 20 with Esta ([UB 128:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p7_10)). He moved to Capernaum in the footsteps of Jesus, and worked in Capernaum alongside Jesus at the Zebedee shipyard ([UB 134:1.1] (/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_1)). In the year 25, Santiago had three children: two boys and a girl, the youngest barely a year old. They were called, in order of age: Santiago, María and José. In the year 27 they had their fourth child, Eleazar, and later they had: Ana (29), Marta (33), and Sara (35).
* Simon married Ana at the beginning of March of the year 24 ([UB 134:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_4)) and they lived in Nazareth. Their first child, Juan, was born in February 26. They later had six more: Judas (29), Simon (31), Maria (32), Berenice (34), Samuel (35), and Josiah (38). Simon was a mason and associate of James ([UB 128:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/128#p2_2)), Miriam's husband.
* Joseph married Rebekah, while Jesus was away, around 22 or 23, and they lived in Nazareth, in the old family home ([UB 134:1.6](/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_6)) . They had their first son, Ariel, at the beginning of the year 24, and then they had Jesus, in July 26, José, in April 28, Maria, in January 30. After Jesus died they had another son in the year 32. José took care of the caravan supply store for a time, and then he left it in the hands of a partner and dedicated himself to carpentry. 
* Judah married Martha in early March 24 ([UB 134:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_4)), in a double wedding with Simon, and they lived in Magdala. Marta had frequent health problems, and they only had one son, in the year 33, named Judas. Judah was a fisherman.
* Miriam married James, Jesus' childhood friend, at the same wedding as James. James was a bricklayer and lived in a house adjacent to Joseph's in Nazareth. Jacobo's mother, Ana, always lived with them. Jacob the father, who had been a partner of Joseph, had died years before their marriage. They had their first child, Jacob, in the year 22, and their second, Joseph, in the year 24. They then had three more: Mary (28), Saul (31), and Anna (33). 
* Martha married Jesus on October 21. They had their first child, whom they named Jesus, in mid-December 25. Later they had seven more: Joseph (27), Matán (30), Mary (32), Judas (33), Ana (35), Elizabeth (37) and Jebud (40).
* Amos. Born on January 9 of the year 7 AD. JC he was almost 13 years younger than Jesus. He died on December 3, 12 AD. de JC, almost 6 years old, from an infection. 
* Ruth did not marry while Jesus lived. Shortly after his death, in early June 30, she married David Zebedee ([UB 190: 1.10] (/en/The_Urantia_Book/190#p1_10)). Ruth lived before her marriage in her mother's house in Capernaum, to which James's family also moved from Nazareth ([UB 134: 1.6] (/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p1_6)). Ruth and David had three children: Jesús (32), Marta (34), and Mariamme (35). Both moved to Philadelphia in early June 30, where they lived. David busied himself serving Lazarus' new home in Philadelphia as a protector and helper. 

Are these names and these biographies reliable?

Not really. Most of the above data are speculations obtained from _The Urantia Book_. But there is no record of this information in either the canonical gospels or the apocrypha, and there is even very little confirmation from The Urantia Book itself. Jesus' family, his cousins, his nephews, and their descendants, disappeared from the pages of history, to give way to a new type of character: the first Christian believers. This makes me draw a first conclusion: Jesus had few followers among his own relatives. Only the brothers of his Santiago, who was nicknamed “the Just”, and who was undoubtedly the first bishop or director of the church of Jerusalem, and also Judas, have jumped to the pages of history. Curiously,

But of his descendants, except for an anecdote collected by the historian Hegesippus in his _Comments on the Acts of the Church_, regarding an interrogation by the emperor Domitian of some grandchildren of Judas, the brother of Jesus, nothing at all. They left no trace in subsequent centuries. And maybe it's understandable. These descendants of the family of Jesus became, overnight, the most hated and persecuted family on earth. It is not hard to imagine that they desired anonymity that led to their disappearance from historical texts.

# The brothers of Jesus

This issue is one of those that has been causing the most controversy and controversy during the centuries of the existence of Christianity. Due to certain mentions made in the New Testament, a question arises: did Jesus have more brothers? Or was he the only child?

The answer to this question would be unimportant were it not for the fact that Christianity postulated a series of dogmas and beliefs regarding the mother of Jesus, Mary, which would clash head-on with the idea that she had other children apart from Jesus. Because, what importance can it have that Jesus was unique or had more brothers? Does that undermine the possible divine origin of him? Does he make him seem more human? Does it make his teachings about “one universal family, that we are all children of God and therefore should treat each other as brothers” less true, or does it enhance them in a more clarifying context?

Personally, I believe that this issue has gone beyond the limits of the rational to establish itself in the realm of mystery and blind faith. Here it is no longer a question of finding out in a historical and contrasted way if there are enough indications to consider that Jesus had more family, but of strengthening and defending predetermined beliefs and postulates. Therefore, we are going to try to offer a summary of the situation, without betting on any of the positions, and let the reader judge for himself.

In the first place, it must be said that there is no conclusive and definitive evidence that Jesus had more brothers. The detractors of this idea have located so many inconsistencies in the idea that the defenders find it difficult to come up with a solution. An archaeological discovery of an ossuary bearing the inscription “Jacob, son of Joseph and brother of Jesus” recently came to light in Israel, which in the end, it seems, turned out to be a hoax. But, if it had been authentic, would that have given us conclusive proof? Apparently not, which indicates to what extent one or another point of view is unprovable. 

Basically there are two positions on the subject and what I am going to do is examine the evidence that each of them provides as arguments in its favor.

## Position A: Jesus had no siblings, he was an only child 

The most important evidence presented is summarized as follows: 

1. The mentions of “brothers” and “sisters” in the New Testament are due to a diffuse translation, but should not be interpreted in a meaningless sense. literal. The Greek is clear when it comes to distinguishing between brother (_aldelphos_), sister (_adelphe_), cousin (_anepsios_) and relative (_synguenis_). But in Hebrew or Aramaic, the word brother (_ah_), could designate other kinship relationships such as cousin.

Some evidence in favor of this interpretation can be found in the Old Testament: “And Moses called Misael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said to them, Come near and bring your brothers out of the sanctuary outside the camp” (Lv 10:4), where the brothers were actually sons of their cousin Aaron; Abraham tells Lot “we are brothers” ([Gn 13:8](/en/Bible/Genesis/13#v8)) when we know that in reality they were uncle and nephew ([Gn 11:26-28](/en /Bible/Genesis/11#v26),[12:5](/en/Bible/Genesis/12#v5)). 

2. The names of “brothers” of Jesus that are cited in the Gospels (Mt 13:55; Mk 6:3) could be explained as “cousins”, sons of some of Jesus' uncles, who could be Cleofás and María, mentioned as parents of “James the younger and Joseph” (Mt 27:56; Mk 14:40; Jn 19:25).

> «Isn't this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called his Mary, and his brothers James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas? Are not all his sisters among us? [Mt 13:55] 

> «Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon? Are not his sisters here among us?" [Mk 6:3] 

> «Many women who had followed Jesus from Galilee to assist him, were contemplating the scene from afar. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of the Zebedee" [Mt ​​27:56]

> «Some women watched the scene from afar. Among them Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James the Less and of Joseph, and Salome, who had followed Jesus and assisted him when he was in Galilee. There were also many others who had gone up with him to Jerusalem» [Mk 14:40] 

> «Next to the cross of Jesus were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Cleopas, and Mary Magdalene» [Jn 19:25] 

These passages and others seem to establish that at the foot of the cross there was a group of women, whose names are offered because they were the ones to whom Jesus appeared first: 

* Mary of Magdala (she is the most mentioned as a beneficiary of the apparitions of Jesus: Mt 27:61,28:1; Mk 15:47,16:1,16:9; Lk 24:10; Jn 20:1,20:11-18 and is also clearly mentioned in Lk 8:2 ),
* Mary the wife of Cleopas, sister of Mary, mother of James the Less and of Joseph, 
* Joan, wife of Cusa, Herod's steward, 
* Salome, wife of Zebedee, the mother of the apostles James and John, 
* possibly also there was Susanna, a follower of Jesus mentioned in Lk 8:2. 

Cleopas and Mary seem suitable candidates as the uncles of Jesus whose children are the ones with whom the brothers of Jesus were confused. Her mother, Mary, frequently accompanied Jesus, from what we are told, and this suggests that her children were also somewhat followers of Jesus.

1. In the letter of Judas of the New Testament, he is presented as «Judas, servant of Jesus Christ and brother of Santiago» (Jds 1). Why doesn't it say “Judas, brother of Jesus Christ and of James”? The idea is that he does not do it because in reality they were not blood brothers, as Santiago de Judas was. 

2. The few testimonies we have of Jesus' adolescence do not seem to indicate that Jesus had siblings. When he goes with his parents to Jerusalem, it seems that only he accompanies them:

> «His parents used to go to Jerusalem every year for the Passover festival. When the boy turned twelve, they went upstairs to celebrate the feast, according to custom. After the party, when they returned, the child Jesus stayed in Jerusalem, without knowing his parents. They believed that he was in the retinue, and at the end of the first journey they looked for him among relatives and acquaintances »[Lk 2: 41-45] 

Did they go in search of Jesus without his children? It doesn't seem likely, which is a point in favor of the idea that Jesus had no brothers. 

1. Jesus asks the apostle John to take care of his mother Mary of him (Jn 19: 26-27). If he had had other siblings, it does not seem appropriate to entrust this guardianship. In that case he wouldn't leave Maria alone.

2. When mention is made of the “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus, it is never explicitly said that they were sons and daughters of Mary, but only this is affirmed of Jesus (Mt 13:55; Mk 6:3). 

3. Ancient texts such as the Protoevangelium of Santiago, dated between 140-170 AD, show a vision of Mary as a woman dedicated to religious service, forming part of the congregation of “virgins of the temple of Jerusalem”. It shows José taking care of her as her husband, but he was a widower and already had children from her previous marriage. 

> «And Joseph, abandoning his tools, went out to join the other widowers, and, all assembled, they went to meet the high priest. [...]» [Protoevangelium of James 9:1]

> «But José refused to say: I am old, and I have children, while she is a girl. [...]» [Protoevangelium of James 9:2] 

Summarizing:

As we can see, this position led, from the earliest Christianity, to at least two possible theories: either that the “brothers” and “sisters” mentioned in the writings referred to cousins ​​of Jesus, children of a sister of his mother; or they referred to children from a previous marriage of Joseph, and therefore to half-brothers and half-sisters of Jesus. This second theory has even more points in its favor. The word brother and sister would not be entirely inappropriate, and would justify the silence that falls on Joseph in the Gospels during the adult life of Jesus. Since Joseph was considered old and a widower, it is reasonable to assume that he died some time before. The passage Jn 7:1-9 also acquires an appropriate timbre, where Jesus' brothers harshly criticize him for the fact that Jesus no longer acts in public.

Of course, this is the official position of the Christian churches from the beginning of Christianity until today, especially in those churches where the belief in the perpetual virginity of Mary became a dogma of faith. Some Protestant churches denied this idea. 

## Position B: Jesus had at least six brothers and sisters 

This position can be summarized as follows: Joseph and Mary were married for the first time like any other marriage of their time, young. Their first son was Jesus, but after him they had four more sons and at least two daughters, who are the ones mentioned in the gospels and other writings. 

The points in favor put forward by those who think so can be summarized as follows:

1. The fact that the Aramaic word _ah_ that designates the brother effectively has a diffuse translation, does not mean that this is the case with the Greek. The evangelist Luke wrote his gospel in Greek and did careful research before writing (Lk 1:3). In the passage Lk 8: 19-21 he uses the Greek word _adelphos_, which explicitly means blood brother. Lucas does not write cousin (_anepsios_), nor foster brother (_syntrophos_), nor half brother (_plêgenês_), nor relative (_synguenis_). On the other hand, if in early Christianity it was so clear that Jesus was an only child and that the aforementioned “brothers” were cousins ​​or half-brothers, then why did all the Greek translators insist on using “_adelphos_”, which is a term that clearly designates a brother? Why didn't they use _anepsios_ or _plêgenês_?

2. The Jewish religion had a very different conception of marriage from that which ancient Christianity seems to transmit. It was strictly forbidden to live together without getting married, and the possibility of a vow of virginity and celibacy in marriage was not admitted. God commanded spouses not to deny each other sexually except for a short time, by mutual consent and to occupy themselves with prayer (this seems to be indicated by Paul, who had a deep Pharisaic formation in 1 Cor 7:3- 5). If position A is true, there is no doubt that Mary and Joseph were in violation of these norms. Furthermore, if Mary and Joseph did not have sexual relations, they could never be married, since the marriage never took place, which is a biblical, civil and ecclesiastical basis for being married.

In the usual ceremony of Jewish weddings in the time of Jesus, the spouses had to spend their first night in the nuptial chamber or _cheder_ and “two friends of the groom” had to watch that nothing prevented the consummation of the marriage, that is, that had sex for the first time. Furthermore, in the annunciation account, we do not hear the archangel commanding Mary to refrain from having sexual relations with her husband (Luke 1:26-38). She so much she only announces to him that she is going to be the mother of a “special” son. But she does not forbid him to continue having other children.

3. From a Jewish socio-cultural point of view, it was an honor for a married woman to have many children, and for a man it was blessed (Ps 127:4.5). Nowhere is it stated outright that Mary did not have other children after Jesus. We are only told that Jesus had stepbrothers or cousins, but this does not exclude the other possibility. 

4. All the mentions made of “brothers” and “sisters” of Jesus are in conjunction with mentions of his mother Mary (Mk 3: 31-15; Mt 12: 46-50; Lk 8: 19 -21; Acts 1:14). Isn't it a bit unusual, in case they were his cousins? Were his cousins ​​constantly by his “Aunt Maria's” side?

5. An argument against the brothers mentioned in various gospels being half-brothers, sons of a previous marriage of Joseph, is in the story of Joseph and Mary's journey to Bethlehem. And when they went to Egypt, the evangelist says: “Joseph got up, took the child and his mother by night, and left for Egypt” (Mt 2:14). If they were previous sons of Joseph, why is there no trace of them in the account? As can be seen, it is an argument similar to the one used in “position A” when they speak of the event of the visit of Jesus and his parents to Jerusalem at the age of twelve.

6. Why did the idea that Mary was the mother of Jesus, a divine being, mean that she and her father could not have sexual relations? The church father Origen affirmed: «...that body which was chosen to render a service to the Word and about which it is said: 'the Holy Spirit will descend upon you and the virtue of the Most High will shelter you with its shadow' did not know any union with man for having descended on him the Holy Spirit and having been sheltered by virtue from above. I reasonably maintain that the first fruit of the purity and chastity of men is Jesus and that of women is Mary. Indeed, it would not be consistent with her piety to attribute to someone other than herself the first fruits of virginity».

Doesn't this text give the feeling that you want to look for a model of life to follow in virginity? Just as Jesus remained celibate, creating a role model for males, so the early Christian church looked to Mary for a similar female role model. 

In short: 

This position demonstrates fairly well that the “cousins” theory is unfounded, but it runs into a stumbling block in proving that Jesus' “brothers” were not half-brothers, sons of another marital relationship of Joseph. The truth is that, as can be seen, there are so many testimonies that seem to point in one direction than the other. Both theories, “carnal brothers” or “step brothers” seem to fit very well with one or another passages of the gospels. 

## Which one to choose?

Without further documentary evidence, it is completely inappropriate to say that the matter is settled and that the evidence points in one direction. Personally, I have leaned towards the “carnal brothers” solution because the other gives the sensation of being a later postulate in Christianity to demonstrate the virginity of Mary. The oldest document that explicitly narrates that Mary was a second wife of an elderly Joseph is the Protoevangelium of James, which was written long after the canonical gospels. Furthermore, if you read this protoevangelium, you will see that the story of Joseph's marriage to Mary is preceded by the narrative of Mary's birth and her childhood as a “virgin in the temple.” Everything seems to want to delve into the idea that Mary was a special woman. Her conception was announced to her parents in a similar way as Jesus was later announced to her. The author wants to establish a parallelism between Mary, the Christian feminine prototype, and Jesus, the masculine. This is verified by the fact that Joseph, throughout this story, seems to be a totally secondary character, something inappropriate for Jewish custom, but more to the liking of Christian Gentiles.

Ultimately, I think the whole discussion is really a discussion about the eternal dilemma of whether Mary, the mother of Jesus, was that “so special” person that many devout Christians have revered and do reverence, and approved of. on the part of the catholic church up to five dogmas, or on the contrary she was a normal and current woman of her time. But we will not continue down this road because there will be time to deal with it in other appendices. 

I personally have no reason to prefer one solution to the problem over another. Whether Jesus was an only child or he had a good number of brothers, I think it is not important to know him and learn his teachings.

But if we reflect and try to imagine what Jesus' motives were for his incarnation, we will realize that Jesus seemed to want to live in the bosom of a normal and average family of his time. That is why he chose a Jewish family like Joseph and Mary were. And this only makes me think that if what I was looking for was a typical family environment, the normal thing at the time and in the Jewish culture was to have many children and live in a large family environment where grandparents, uncles, cousins ​​and brothers used to live together, meet frequently, and even form community dwellings for the entire clan. Only if we understand that Jesus came to live and experience in his own flesh a full and complete human life will we realize that having been an only child would have deprived him precisely of the great educational benefits that having siblings entails.

# The Alphaeus twins 

The apostles called James and Judas in the gospels have always been subject to some confusion on the part of exegetes. Since two of Jesus' brothers have been mentioned by these names, it has been assumed that they were the same people, and therefore that Jesus had two brothers among his twelve intimate followers. But this does not square with a notorious fact. The gospels mention characters named James and Judas in several unclear passages: 

> “A little further on he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John” [Mk 1:19]

It mentions a James, but clearly specifies that he is the son of Zebedee and brother of John. The reason for this clarification is logical, it is about distinguishing this Santiago from another. 

> «a Andrés, Felipe, Bartolomé, Mateo, Tomás, Santiago el hijo de Alfeo, Tadeo, Simón el Cananeo» [Mc 3:18]

Here appears the other James, whom he is called, to further distinguish him from the preceding, son of Alphaeus. An apostle named simply Tadeo also appears. 

> «and Judas Iscariot, the one who betrayed him» [Mk 3:19] 

Another Judas appears but is clearly identified as a different Judas, since he is called Iscariot, and we already know from the story that he would be the traitor. Therefore there is no confusion of this Judas with the one with whom we are concerned. 

> “Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon?” [Mk 6:3]

Another Santiago appears. But this Santiago is clearly mentioned as brother of Jesus and son of Mary (and Joseph, right?). He also appears as the brother of Jesus another Judas. But it is clear that the Judas of Mk 3:19 and this one are different people, because in that case, how could the evangelist not mention in Mk 3:19 that Santiago was the brother of Jesus, something so transcendental? In addition, in Mk 3:19 he is mentioned as the son of Alphaeus, which would leave us as the only solution that Mary had remarried a man named Alphaeus. If this were so, why do the Nazarenes speak of this Santiago as the son of Mary, why do they not say “son of Alphaeus”? 

The names of the other brothers of Jesus are Joseph and Simon.

> «Some women watched the scene from afar. Among them Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James the younger and of Joseph, and Salome» [Mk 15:40] 

Yet another James appears! Now the mother of this Santiago is called María, this Santiago is called by the evangelist “the minor”, ​​a nickname that he had not used until now with any other Santiago, and on top of that he is the brother of a certain José. Who is he? It could refer to the brothers of Jesus, James and Joseph, who we just saw, but then why doesn't the evangelist clearly say “Mary, the mother of Jesus”? Obviously, because it's not her. Therefore there was another woman named Mary with two sons, one named James, and the other Joseph, apart from Mary the mother of Jesus.

> «After the Sabbath, Mary Magdalene, Mary of Santiago and Salome bought perfumes to go and embalm Jesus» [Mk 16:1] 

Here we see the previous Mary again, and again, instead of telling us, Mary the Mother of Jesus, we are once again told “Maria la de Santiago”, with the purpose of distinguishing her from other Marías. Then it becomes clear that Mary the mother of Jesus and this Mary were different people and both had sons named James. In short, we have three Santiagos: the son of Zebedee, a son of Mary and brother of Jesus, and a third Santiago, son of another Mary. It remains to be seen if this last James is the one mentioned as an apostle and as the son of a certain Alphaeus.

> «Matthew, Thomas and James, the son of Alphaeus, Simon called Zelota, Judas the son of James and Judas Iscariot, who was the traitor» [Lk 6:16] 

Luke introduces a significant change in the list of apostles. Mark spoke of a certain “Tadeo”, but here this apostle disappears and is replaced by a certain Judas, the son of Santiago. Another Santiago and another Judas!! Are Tadeo and this Judas the same person? 

These are all the passages with some data (those repeated in other evangelists have not been included). 

Other mentionable apocryphal sources 

* _Letter of the apostles_ (_Epistola epistolarum_): mentions a Judas the Zealot. Scholars think that it actually refers to Simon the Zealot. I am not of the same opinion 
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judas_the_Zealot).
* _Eusebius_: mentions a Thaddeus of Edessa, but does not mention him as an apostle, but as one of the seventy evangelists, so we must think that they are different Thaddeus 
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thaddeus_of_Edessa) . 
* _Ancient manuscripts of Matthew in Latin_: they mention that the apostle Judas that concerns us was nicknamed Lebeo
	(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jude_the_Apostle ).

As we can see, with only these mentions, it is completely impossible to find a unanimity on the identity of these two dark apostles. Everything gets more complicated if we also consider that Alphaeus, who appears as the father of Santiago, also appears as the father of Levi. Are they the same Alphaeus or different? And to finish the mess, Juan appears mentioning a Mary, wife of Cleofás at the foot of the cross, when it turns out that we have seen that there was a Mary, mother of Santiago, and wife of Alphaeus. Are this Cleophas and Alphaeus the same person or different? 

All this confusion has caused different Christian churches to adopt different solutions to family relationships between people who hid behind these names.

_The Urantia Book_ offers a vision of its own. James and Judas appear as twin brothers and sons of a man named Alphaeus, and his mother was named Mary. His nicknames, Tadeo for Santiago (note, not for Judas, as has always been supposed!), and Lebeo for Judas, were exactly the nicknames that circulated in the apocryphal manuscripts. The two apostles, as we have seen before, were not the two brothers of Jesus (James and Judas) who appear mentioned in the gospels as such, and who took on a lot of prominence at the beginning of the Christian church. Nor was there any relationship of kinship between Santiago and Judas of Alphaeus with the family of Jesus. Jesus did not know these men beforehand, and they were introduced to him by James and John Zebedee.

Why then did writers like the evangelists, who are supposed to be direct followers of apostles or disciples who had known Jesus, not pick up on the fact that these apostles James and Judas were brothers and also twins? _The Urantia Book_ (doc. 139. 9 and 10) has a clear answer: these men, once Jesus disappeared, returned home and gave up the great business of being preachers in the name of Jesus. They didn't feel capable, and simply went back to their networks and their routine life. A more than convincing reason to understand that in a few years these men were almost forgotten and it was no longer remembered that they were two brothers.

# The “silenced” apostles: Abner and the early Christian Church of the East 

The information torrent of _The Fifth Insight_ is impressive and Only thanks to him have many of us been able to glimpse, for the first time, some things that we Christians had not even considered.


One of these things is the existence of many “silenced” apostles or disciples, followers of Jesus of great importance in the early stages of the emergence of Christianity, but who, with the passage of time, ended up submerged in oblivion. They were not mentioned by early Christian writers, or were left out on purpose.


One of those cases was that of David Zebedeo, whom we had never heard of because we thought that the Zebedeos were only two brothers, Santiago and Juan. A special and separate mention would deserve the numerous women, great believers and followers of the Rabbi, of whom we have no news and of whom _The Fifth Revelation_ does echo. Women such as Nalda, the Samaritan woman whom Jesus asked for a drink; Ruth, the youngest sister of Jesus; Perpetua, Peter's wife... Some women who even formed a group of twelve “apostles” of whom people like Paul of Tarsus and other followers of his obviously did not even want to hear,

But this theme of “silenced” women has much more to offer and will require a special article for them, later, when the theme arises throughout the novel. 

Today I would like to talk about another eternal “forgotten” whom “The Fifth Revelation” seems to be trying to rescue from oblivion: Abner.

Abner (born 16 BC and died 11/21/74) was a Nazirite member of the Nazirite colony of En-Geddí, and for a time the leader of this colony. The Nazirites, of whom we have already spoken in an article dedicated to the Jewish religious groups of the time, were a small organization of believers who made very special vows regarding purity that gave them a very high social distinction, since they shared the honor, along with the high priest, of being the only ones allowed to enter the Holy of Holies in the Temple of Jerusalem. In this sense, Abner should be seen as highly respected, even by the Jewish clergy, at least until he became a follower of Jesus.

Abner became close friends with John the Baptist in the Nazarean order. Abner had been the head and acknowledged leader of this Nazirite colony, surely until his leanings toward John caused him to lose that leadership ([UB 135:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/135#p2_4) and [UB 142:8.1] (/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p8_1)). He was the chief of John's disciples, his right arm. He had a group of John's disciples in charge of him, all from Judea. Abner was a native of Sebaste, in Samaria, but it is impossible that he was a Samaritan, since he was a Nazirite. Simply, he was born in Sebaste ([UB 144:9.1] (/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p9_1)).

Abner became a fervent believer in Jesus and his staunchest ally, even more so than the apostles themselves. In fact, Jesus entrusted him with the direction of the seventy evangelists ([UB 144:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p7_4)). Abner was associated with Andrew when Jesus' twelve and John's twelve worked together ([UB 146:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p3_9)). (It should be remembered here that it was Andrés, and not his brother Pedro, who held the leadership ofhe group of apostles in Jesus' life, although the tables later turned). Apart from the apostles of John led by Abner, he came to form around him a group of fifty disciples ([UB 163: 0.1] (/en/The_Urantia_Book/163#p0_1)). _The Urantia Book_ tells us that his work as a preacher and that of his associated disciples was more far-reaching than that of the apostles, arriving already during the public life of Jesus to send disciples to Alexandria, where a group of followers of the Master was formed. (162:9.2).

After Jesus' death, Abner became head of the church in Philadelphia, just as Jesus' brother James was head of the church in Jerusalem ([UB 166:5.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166 #p5_1)), and both had serious disagreements. He was also on good terms with neither Peter nor Paul ([UB 166: 5.3] (/ en / The_Urantia_Book / 166 # p5_3)), which explains why none of the later gospels mention or name him. Abner, in these disputes with some apostles, had on his side Lazarus of Bethany and his sisters, who sold their property and moved to Philadelphia ([UB 168: 5.3] (/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p5_3 )). He was also supported by David Zebedee ([UB 171:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p1_5)), and he had the support of Nathanael, who lived in Philadelphia for a year ([UB 193:6.4](/en/ The_Urantia_Book/193#p6_4)).

Abner did as much preaching work to the east as Paul did to the west. In fact, Abner had a more Eastern or Babylonian view of the teachings of Jesus. Abner maintained close contacts with the eldest son of Cymboiton, the director of the famous Urmia academy where Jesus taught for a few months ([UB 134:6.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p6_15)), but it seems that he did not choose well to the disciples he sent to Urmia, because they caused much anxiety in the academy and later it had to close its doors.

_The Urantia Book_ seems to have nothing but words of praise for Abner, unlike the many criticisms he makes of Paul of Tarsus. He mentions Paul as one of the great universal religious teachers, but only because of the great effects he had, not because his teachings were correct. Says _The Urantia Book_ about Abner's disciples: "During the last years of Abner's life and for some time after his death, the believers in Philadelphia who were led by Abner held to the religion of Jesus, just as this one had taught it, more than any other group on Earth” ([UB 166:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p5_6)).

Abner lived to be 89 years old, and died in Philadelphia on November 21, 74 ([UB 166:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/166#p5_7)). It is very striking that the writers of _The Urantia Book_ only give the date of death of this follower of Jesus and no other, including the apostles. Without a doubt, they do it in recognition of this misunderstood man, whom it is clear that they place above Paul in terms of fidelity to the Master's message. As much as _The Urantia Book_ insists on the differences between the preaching of Abner and Paul ([UB 171:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p5_6)), there is a certain preference for Abner. In _The Urantia Book_ Abner is almost as protagonist or more than Peter and the twelve; just see what Jesus' most emotional last words address to him ([UB 171:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p3_2)):

What became of this Christian Church promoted by Abner and his disciples, as well as by the apostle Nathanael and others? _The Urantia Book_ drops some very mysterious information: “The Eastern version of Jesus' message, while remaining more faithful to his teachings, continued to follow Abner's uncompromising attitude. It never progressed as the Hellenized version did but ultimately fizzled out within the Islamic movement." ([UB 195:1.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p1_11)). Within the Islamic movement? Is it that there were contacts and mixing between primitive Christianity and Islam? Well, it could well be, if we look at the pioneering studies that some experts such as Günter Lünling have carried out on the subject. On this subject, which is worthy of a specific in-depth article (at another time),

“It is known that the Bible is not a homogeneous product of a single mind but that it presents a great diversity of ideas gathered in a rather haphazard way, and transmitted in an often doubtful way until their definitive inclusion in the codex of the Old or the New Testament. Until now, however, the same view has not applied to the Koran, which is commonly accepted as the creation of a single man, Muhammad - his exact name was Muhammad ben Abdullah - in the 7th century (except, of course, those who attribute to him directly divine origin).

“The German theologian Günter Lüling, from Erlangen, has carried out a detailed exegetical investigation of the Koranic text. He reaches a conclusion practically unheard of in current historiography, but no less convincing for that: the core of the Holy Book of Islam is made up of a certain number of Paleo-Christian songs that were later modified and enriched with other ideas». 

«Lüling's first publications in this sense date back to 1970. They were initially rejected by other theologians and orientalists. Today, however, Lüling has a diverse following among prestigious German, French and English Orientalists.


Was _The Urantia Book_, which dates back to 1934, already anticipating with its paragraph 195:1.11 what is beginning to be discovered by modern Islamic exegesis?

# The composition of the gospels according to The Urantia Book 

## The sources of the fourth part of The Urantia Book 

The writer of the fourth part of _The Urantia Book_ has been a single being, a secondary intermediate being who had the apostle Andrew in his custody (UB 121: 0), who, aided by a commission of eleven other midwayers and a Melchizedek, put this part in writing.

As sources for writing it, the midwayer relied on the following: 

* His own memories of assisting the apostle Andrew, and the memories of other heavenly beings ([UB 121:8.1](/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1)) . 
* The lost writings of Andrew ([UB 121:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1)). Interestingly, I have found that there must indeed have been a gospel according to Andrew, which Wikipedia echoes [^1], and of which nothing has come down to us at all.
* Concepts or human expressions of two thousand human authors, who have lived from the time of Jesus until the moment in which the fourth part of _The Urantia Book_ is written. It appears that even some of these authors were still living at the time of writing ([UB 121:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_13)). These concepts and ideas affirm that they have been used in such a way that if necessary they have been modified to make the concept more truthful. 
* The four extant gospels ([UB 121:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1)). 


## Facts from The Urantia Book about the composition of the gospels

Regarding the process of formation of the gospels, _The Urantia Book_ describes a series of writings, which appeared some under the influence of others and of different authors. The list would be the following:

* _Original Gospel of Mark_ ([UB 121:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_3)): was written by John Mark, who was a collaborator of Peter in Rome and was the son of Elijah Mark, the owner of the house where Jesus celebrated the last supper. Actually, this gospel was sponsored by Peter. Marcos wrote it between the years 67 and 68. When he finished it, the last fifth part was destroyed. This gospel, without that last part, is what we could call the _original Gospel of Mark_. _The Urantia Book_ says that Mark relied entirely on his personal recollections and on Peter's recollections. It was not based on any other previous writing.
* _Gospels based on Mark's_ ([UB 121:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_3)): These were modifications of the original Mark, mostly removing passages and adding material to the final blank. It is curious that for quite some time there has been talk of a _secret Gospel of Mark_, discovered in 1958 in a supposed letter from Clement of Alexandria [^2]. In my opinion, this letter is talking about copies of some of these gospels based on the original of Mark. 
* _Current Gospel of Mark_: it is one of the gospels based on the _original Gospel of Mark_, which finally got the approval of the Church and was accepted as the correct one.
* _Matthew's original notes_ ([UB 121:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_5)): Matthew took notes during Jesus' lifetime of many of his sayings ([UB 139:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/ 139#p7_5)), and also just after Jesus died ([UB 121:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_5)). They were written in Aramaic. In my opinion, they served as the basis for other writings, but they never survived to the present day.
* _Gospel of Matthew in Aramaic_ ([UB 121:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_6)): is a gospel that was written in the year 40 (_The Urantia Book_ does not say who the author was) and that was an expansion and correction of the _Matthew's original Notes_. Apparently it was a personal document that someone possessed or disseminated very little, and the last copy was destroyed in a fire in a Syrian monastery in the year 416. In my opinion this is the gospel that the experts call the _Gospel of the Hebrews_, of the that we have only received quotes [^3].
* _Gospel of Matthew in Greek_ ([UB 121:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_7)): was written by a disciple of Matthew, named Isador, in the year 71, in Pella, on the Jordan. For this he used, according to _The Urantia Book_, only Matthew's memories, Matthew's original notes, and the _original Gospel of Mark_. In my opinion he also used the _Andrew's Modified Notes_. 
* _Current Gospel of Matthew_: is the result of successive modifications of the _Gospel of Matthew in Greek_ until it was finally fixed as we know it today. 
* _Cedes Article_ ([UB 121:8.9](/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_9)): Cedes was a believer from Antioch who wrote this article in 78 AD. _The Urantia Book_ does not mention its contents. I have found no record of such writing anywhere.
* _Andrew's Notes_ ([UB 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9)): Andrew wrote them just after Jesus was crucified. Copies of this document circulated for a time among the Christian communities. 
* _Andrew's Notes_ modified ([UB 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9)): these are the _Andrew's Notes_ to which progressively modifications were made to try to make it seem like a gospel.
* _Andrew's Gospel_ ([UB 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9)): is the document that the _Andrew's Modified Notes_ ended up becoming, after various additions and corrections by different authors. The last copy was destroyed in a fire in Alexandria about a hundred years after Andrew wrote the original. In my opinion, this gospel is what the experts also call the _Gospel of Andrew_ [^4], of which only mentions have reached us, and which is mistakenly considered identical to the so-called _Acts of Andrew_, and it is also, in my opinion, the called by the experts _Document Q_ [^5], so called because it is considered the original source of Matthew and Luke, and of which no copy has come down to us, and it has only been regenerated based on analyzing the current gospels.
* _Gospel of Luke_ ([UB 121:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_9)): written by Luke, a disciple of Paul, from Antioch in Pisidia. He wrote it in the year 82 in Achaia. He based his writing on the teachings of Paul, on dozens of witnesses to the life of Jesus, on the _original Gospel of Mark_, on the _Gospel of Matthew in Greek_, on the _Cedes Article_, and on the _Andrew's Modified Notes_. 
* _Current Gospel of Luke_: is the result of some modifications that were made to the Gospel of Luke. 
* _Acts of the apostles_: second part that Luke wrote of his gospel. His intention was to write a third part, I suppose recounting the ups and downs of Paul and Peter in Rome, but Luke died before finishing the Acts.
* _Selta's Apocalyptic Writing_ ([UB 176:2.8](/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_8)): Selta was an employee of Caligula's court who wrote this article about the Messiah and the parable of the ten virgins. In the second century, the Gospels of Matthew especially (Mt 24-25), and to some extent Mark (Mk 13) and Luke (Lk 21), were expanded to include a modified version of this Selta writing as if it were a speech delivered by Jesus on the end of time. This was, apparently, the greatest modification that these gospels suffered in a spurious way, and they significantly distorted the authentic teachings of the Master on this subject.
* _First Epistle of Peter_ ([UB 139:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p2_12)). It was written by Peter himself, although the current version is a modification of the original by a disciple of Paul. 
* _Original Gospel of John_ ([UB 121:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_10) and [UB 139:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_15)): was written by Nathan of Caesarea, a disciple of John, the year 101, at Ephesus in Asia (John was extraordinarily long-lived). Nathan relied on Juan's memories and all other existing documents. In my opinion, the originality of the content of this gospel, which shows details that the other three current gospels do not show, is proof that there were other gospels and writings that also contained much valuable information.
* _Current Gospel of John_: The original gospel was heavily modified over time to make it appear as if it had been written by John himself. It is very likely that the striking Prologue, for example, was a later addition. 
* _Original Apocalypse of John_ ([UB 139:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_14)): John wrote it during an exile on Patmos. The original was much longer than the current book. 
* _Current Apocalypse of John_: is a version of the original, in which large portions were deleted and others were modified. 
* _First Epistle of John_ ([UB 121:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_10)): was written by John himself as an explanation of the work Nathan had done. However, there is no indication in this letter of this, such as a mention of Nathan or his gospel.
* _Notes of Thomas_ ([UB 139:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p8_12)): A few weeks before he died, Thomas began to write a gospel. It is not clear to me if this document is the actual _Gospel of Thomas_ of the scholars [^6]. In my opinion this text uses the incipient writing of Thomas, but then adds many supposed sayings of Jesus of a Gnostic type that were not part of the original writing of Thomas. The final document is very Gnostic in taste, with enigmatic sentences and double meanings.

There are many other books called apocryphal in Christian literature, as we will see later, but it is enough to take a look at them to notice that they are no longer documents related to the life of Jesus but are legends about Jesus (especially about his birth), stories parallel or derived from the gospels, or else pseudo-mystical lucubrations. There is nothing of value in these writings, since the original sources are exhausted with the previous ones. 

## The two-source theory

In my opinion the two-source theory is correct[^7], and _The Urantia Book_ fits it. Basically what this theory of the experts says is that both Matthew and Luke used a double source to write their gospels, one that is known to us, the _Gospel of Mark_, and another totally enigmatic, of which we have no news, and that experts have dubbed the _Q document_. In this way, the coincidences between Matthew and Luke that are not reported in Mark would be explained.

But first we should say that in _The Urantia Book_ we are missing a mention that says that Isador wrote the _Gospel of Matthew in Greek_ also using the _Andrew's Modified Notes_ as a source, just as Luke did. It makes sense if we think that we are told that Isador moved from Jerusalem to Pella ([UB 121:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_7)). Isador must have known Andrés, who surely also lived in Jerusalem with Pedro for a while. Therefore, Isador must have had access to the writings of Andrés, the _Notes of Andrés_ or one of the modified versions of it. 

Continuing with the theory of the two sources, what the experts call _document Q_ would be none other, according to _The Urantia Book_, than the lost writings of the apostle Andrew, the _Andrew's Modified Notes_.

In orange, the documents for which we do not have any text today; in orange stripes, if we have any indication in Christian literature with a fragment; in green the documents that we have complete. The lines mark the influence that some writings exerted on others. The dotted line is the only one that is not mentioned in _The Urantia Book_, and that I suppose is also valid. 

## Considerations about the composition process of the gospels

As we can see, the number of gospels that were written was very low. The reason given by _The Urantia Book_ is that the first generation of disciples (the apostles), very faithfully followed the idea that Jesus instilled in them that they should not record his teachings in writing. 

The second generation of disciples was something else. It is curious to note that all the evangelists were actually writers of the second generation: Mark was actually a follower of Peter, although he knew Jesus somewhat; Isador was a disciple of Mateo and the authentic writer of the Gospel of Mateo; Lucas was a follower of Paul, who also did not know Jesus; and finally Nathan, the writer of the fourth gospel, was the disciple of John Zebedee.

There could have been six gospels. It is clear that we are missing the _Gospel of Andrew_, which is neither more nor less than an expanded version of what experts today call the _Q document_, and which surely contained many unpublished passages from the life of Jesus that no other gospel mentioned. And we are also missing the _Gospel of Thomas_, but this not because it had the misfortune of being destroyed, but simply because Thomas died before finishing it. The only thing that has come down to us from him are some sayings, surely many of which were certainly written by Thomas, which is what experts today call the _Gospel of Thomas_.

Of the five gospels that we finally have, something remarkable is clearly seen: practically the story that is told follows a unique scheme or pattern. The only gospel that is really very original and outside of that pattern is the _Gospel of John_. This offers us a deplorable panorama to try to obtain a plural vision of the life of Jesus. Actually what we have in the five gospels is at most a dual vision. 

Basically the stories about the life of Jesus were composed following these stages: 

1. During his life or just when Jesus died we have some notes taken by Mateo and Andrés. They would basically be phrases, sayings of Jesus and some speeches.
2. Some disciples augment these writings by adding short stories related to Jesus. The gospels that have not reached our days are formed, such as the _document Q_ (in reality the _document Q_ was the proto-gospel of Andrew, which I call the _Modified Notes of Andrew_) or the _Gospel of the Hebrews_, which I call the _Gospel of Matthew in Aramaic_. These writings circulated in a very limited way and surely contained many inaccuracies since they never appeared under the patronage of an important apostle, hence their denomination was “of the Hebrews” and the like (Nazarenes, Ebionites). Later these writings were branded as incorrect and they were marginalized until they disappeared. It is striking that the _Gospel of Andrew_, the authentic _document Q_ as I believe, and that had so much later influence, ended up as a mere mention and no one cared to preserve more copies, to the point of disappearing. Shouldn't its content have been extremely unpublished and important?
3. The gospels begin to be written. The first to write it is Marcos. He was the one who established the scheme or model for all the later gospels (baptism-preaching-passion of Jesus in Jerusalem). It is curious that _The Urantia Book_ says that Mark relied entirely on Peter's and personal memories, when he could have at his disposal the notes of Andrew and Matthew, or the gospels arising from these notes. This fact is something that exegetes have already observed in Mark. Mark seems to have a unique originality, and to be the first gospel to be written, while Matthew and Luke seem to copy Mark and another source as well.
4. Matthew and Paul patronize their gospels (Matthew's and Luke's). These writers write much more complete gospels, since they not only use Mark's model, but also incorporate more material. Much of that material comes from _Andrew's notes_ (_The Urantia Book_ doesn't say so but I'm convinced Matthew used Andrew's notes as well). Without knowing it, by reading the Gospels of Matthew and Luke we are reading the lost Gospel of Andrew. I believe that this lost gospel is what the experts call the _Q document_, and that it would explain the similarities between Matthew and Luke that are not found in Mark (the theory of the two sources). However, even though these evangelists added many new passages that were not in Mark, and gave us a larger and better perspective on the life of Jesus, Basically, they follow Marcos' scheme very faithfully. For example, a striking fact about these three Gospels (they are called Synoptics because of how much they resemble each other) is that the entire preaching of Jesus seems to take place over the course of only one year. As there are hardly any chronological mentions, it does not seem clear how long the public life of Jesus lasted.
5. Thomas begins to write his gospel, and begins like Andrew and Matthew with some notes with sayings and phrases of Jesus. But he dies soon after and his intention to write another gospel comes to nothing. Some disciples amplify and write down these notes of Thomas, and that is the _gospel of Thomas_ that we have today. Experts have verified that there are many unpublished phrases of Jesus in this writing that are not in Mark, Matthew or Luke, which shows that it was an original writing by Thomas, based only on his own memories. Unfortunately, we will never know what the gospel that this apostle would have come to write would have been like. Would it have been based on the other three or would it have been an original story?
6. An unknown author amplifies the _Andrew's notes_ and turns them into a gospel. He surely used a lot of material from the other three gospels, so this gospel would ultimately seem like a copy of the others, albeit with enormous originality derived from the fact that he used a source with a lot of important content. That this gospel must have been important in its content to know Jesus derives from the fact that the fourth part of _The Urantia Book_ is largely based on this gospel, of which the heavenly beings have a copy. What a great pity that this gospel, unfortunately, was destroyed! How many more things would we have known about Jesus! The last copy in existence was burned, according to _The Urantia Book_ ([UB 139:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p1_9)), about a hundred years after the original was written (year 30). It seems that it could have been during the Kitos war, in the year 115 to 117, when this unfortunate event took place [^8], since a Jewish revolt that spread to Alexandria is dated here, and in which the Jews burned many Alexandrian buildings. Interestingly, it was the Jews who finally put an end to this gospel.
7. Lastly, John writes his gospel, with the clear intention of narrating episodes from the life of Jesus that had not been told and to offer, in his opinion, a clearer and more exact vision of some of Jesus' words. The amount of detail that John offers about the Last Supper has no equivalent in other Gospels. And there are many miracles that no one else told, like the one at Cana. It is clear that the synoptic gospels represent an outline in the account of the life of Jesus (which includes two sources, Mark and Andrew), but thanks to John we have a different and original second vision of Jesus. 

## The other gospels that scholars call apocryphal

There are many other writings, apart from those already mentioned here, which are sometimes called Gospels, which belong to those writings which in Christianity were called Apocrypha. However, it is very incorrect to call them gospels. Most of them do not follow the actual outline of a story about the whole life of Jesus (from his birth to his death and resurrection), with a remarkable amount of sayings and teachings about him. Basically these writings are extensions of the already existing gospels, or pseudo-mystical literature of the time, and none of them reaches a date such as the first century, all are from the second century or later. In my opinion, all this literature is pure speculation by 2nd century writers trying to fill in the gaps, and unfortunately,

A list of these writings, excluding the apocryphal ones that have already been mentioned above, could be the following: 

* _Protoevangelium of Santiago_ [^9]: account only of the conception and birth of Jesus that was largely already in the other gospels. It is simply an extension made in the second century. 
* _Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew_ [^ 10]: expansion of the story of the birth of Jesus, with a multitude of fanciful stories about his childhood, made during the 2nd century.

Precisely the first fathers mention it criticizing it, since they deny that it could be the work of the apostle Peter.

# Scientific research on the “historical Jesus”

How can historical science have the arrogance to claim to speak of a historical Jesus when clearly the information that can be considered historical about Jesus is so fragmentary, limited, and unreliable? The historical Jesus is an invention of modern science that builds a new religion, the religion of the historical Jesus, for which Jesus is nothing more than a normal and common man of his time, stripped of all his supernatural characteristics with which he supposedly has clothed early Christianity. The question is that Jesus existed, he was a real person of whom there are enough testimonies in non-Christian authors to know that he actually existed, but about his life and his teachings, the amount of what is known is so little, and the material is so useless from a scientific point of view, that when historians try to disentangle the Jesus from history, all attempts result in unbearable arrogance. There was a Jesus, yes, but science cannot access him with the available material, and should stop assuming that it can access him, confusing millions of people who now live with the idea that the real Jesus, the one that really existed, can be assimilated to the historical Jesus of the scholars, and therefore can be known and accessed without difficulty. The reality is that we are just as far from the real Jesus as a Roman from Rome could be from both the year 30 and the year 130. He was hardly known in his time,

Honestly, there are only two possible ways to get to the real Jesus: new discoveries or revelation. The Gospel of John says that Jesus did many other things than those recorded in the Gospel, and that if they were written down one by one, there would not be enough books in the world to recount them. The obvious exaggeration is not so much if one thinks that the evangelist already posits Jesus as a heavenly being who pre-existed before being born as a human in the world, and who after his death came back to life. It is possible that aside from the four synoptic gospels and those other apocryphal writings that have survived to our days, there is still lost, in some hidden place, some ancient manuscript with a new gospel, some like those of which we only have mentions in the texts of the church fathers. If such a manuscript ever appeared, and the contents were enormously substantial, it could turn the historical science on Jesus upside down. Until then, science will remain useless in this case. On the other hand, if Jesus was who the disciples said of him, if he was a supernatural being who came from Heaven, perhaps humanity harbors another hope. We may be given the truth about the life and teachings of Jesus through some revelation.

Of course, these things have already happened, and many times they were not what we expected. A text called the Gospel of Judas was recently discovered, and it appeared in the world for the first time. But after many translations, the text contained almost nothing of substance about Jesus. And as for revelations, how many new Christian sects have formed in the last few centuries assuring to follow the dictates of a new revelation made by some angel to some lucky beneficiary. An example of this could be the revelations of the beatified Anne Catherine Emmerick. True? Fraudulent? Or The Urantia Book, possibly the most extensive document ever written on the life and teachings of Jesus, which even speaks profusely about who Jesus was before he came from Heaven to Earth. What credibility can we give to these texts?

# Did Jesus really exist?

When the modern historian poses the question of who Jesus of Nazareth was, when he even asks if he was a true character, if he really existed, he uses a method of approaching the character that I believe is incomplete and inadequate. The scientist behind the honest historian makes use of the method of science to try to find out as many truthful things about the character as possible. I consider myself to some extent a scientist and I also do the same. I examine literary, epigraphic, and archaeological evidence. I search through all the material I can gather about the conclusions of other authors. I elaborate theories, I compare them with the facts, I try to follow a method that has given such good results in fields such as chemistry, physics, biology...

And yet, the question that I rarely hear on the lips of a historian who investigates the figure of Jesus is: have I really achieved a greater understanding of who this man was? Because the historian, as the scientist that he is, does a terrible thing: he simply eliminates, with a stroke of the pen, any possibility that this man was something more than a mere man. He excludes the possibility that the miracles were nothing more than exaggerations of his disciples, he eliminates the option that the supernatural was true, that it was really the one who later transmitted to us his followers, a heavenly envoy, someone superhuman. And they do this because for the scientist, since he cannot provide facts about the supernatural, he excludes it. He does not exist by definition.

This behavior seems like a bug to me. The scientist works with facts. And it is the facts, and only the facts, that are available to him that he should use to draw conclusions. But if he doesn't have evidence, clues or facts, he shouldn't jump to conclusions. How do we know that Jesus of Nazareth was not a supernatural being? What is the evidence against him not being? We can think, of course, that someone invented Jesus, that someone exaggerated Jesus, that someone gave a distorted image of him. Even if that had happened, would that rule out the possibility that it had been someone “else”? What if it turned out in the end that his followers fell short on who he is? What if it were that Jesus of Nazareth is much more even than what his followers told us?

History, like all science, has a great virtue. It allows us to use a mechanism, a method, to support our knowledge on a secure basis. But by itself, it is not enough. The historian, as the person he is, must use this method properly. Many times renowned historians have reached conclusions based on what they 'don't find', what 'usually happens', and what they 'want to imagine the solution to be'. Sometimes, too many times, the theory is elaborated before having any facts on the table.

For centuries and centuries millions of people around the world have believed, due to different circumstances, that the man who lived in Judea in Roman times was a supernatural being. Even a celestial being close to or nearly identical to God himself. Could all that huge number of people have been living a lie. It's possible. But when the scientist and the historian decide without evidence that the supernatural is impossible, that since there are no facts to say that such things can happen they do not, he is deluding himself. It could be that the supernatural is an integral part of our universe, and we don't realize it. Why should the universe be only what our scientific capacities can grasp of it? Why should the totality of the reality of the universe be only what the scientists, with their measuring instruments, could they capture? We live in a universe that challenges the brightest minds in science. Its dimensions, its age, its constitution and its formation process, the enormous diversity of things that inhabit it, whether they are stars, living beings, societies, people... That enormous complexity that leaves all scientists perplexed, that always surpasses to all science no matter how much we advance, could it not keep within itself innumerable unknown things and beyond all possible verification?

When I see Jesus reduced to a mere uncultured and marginalized cabinetmaker, like a Jewish guerrilla fighter or the unwanted child between a Jewish woman and a Roman soldier... When I see all the theories or hypotheses that have been considered about Jesus and I hear people say that this man did not start anything but that it was his ardent followers who made him a Jewish king and then a heavenly being, I see very little faith in a universe that surpasses us. I see many people without asking themselves the question of how such a complex and unattainable universe for our limited mind is possible. I see too much arrogance in the idea that man is capable of understanding everything, is even capable of knowing everything about a man who lived hundreds of years ago and whose only testimonies are so impartial and so little close to the character himself,

Science can be made of a city, of an empire, of a work of art. But you can't do science about a character like Jesus. The “historical Jesus”, that Jesus who is sold to us as if he mattered more than any other Jesus in the world, is a hundred steps behind the authentic Jesus, that Jesus who we will never know how he was without external help. Even if an ancient writing giving extensive and detailed testimony about Jesus were discovered in the Judean desert tomorrow, even then, Jesus would still be beyond. Because in the short list of names of people whose legend includes him having returned from death to life and having been the origin of a huge and massive religion, there is only one name. There are not two, nor three, nor ten. There is only one name. And that name will always leave us with an eternal doubt if we apply only and exclusively the scientific method to approach it. Have we really discovered the real Jesus? Or have we remade, as his followers did in his time, a Jesus at our convenience, a Jesus built, instead of with the hands of devotion, with the hands of science?

I've been following Jesus for too many years to know that not even with _The Urantia Book_, or with whatever revelation it is, we are and will never be sure of anything. The accumulation of knowledge, the reading of many books about his figure and about his time, allow pieces to fit together, to close the puzzle, allow incredible moments in which “a light” suddenly flashes, an “inquiry”. But that does not mean that we have solved the puzzle. The question is always there like a sword of Damocles: what proof do we have of what we believe? What finding assures us what we have concluded after reading so much? For example, thanks to _The Urantia Book_ we know that Jesus made several long trips to the East and West. That he even lived for several months in Rome, in the very capital of the empire, meeting very significant people in a curious way. But I said “we know” somewhat lightly. Do we really know? What evidence is there that this happened? There is no indication in the testimonies that we have that Jesus made these trips. We know that he traveled to Egypt with his parents and lived there for a time when he was a child. And again I use “we know” lightly, for are we sure that the only evangelist who mentions this picked it up with certainty, or did he just do it to conform the life of Jesus to an ancient prophecy? That is, what certainties do we have at the end of something that are only written, not documents, not certified, not references? None. We elaborate that certainty in our mind. We make what we want to believe. Not what we should believe, because there are no facts that prove anything,

In the end, research on Jesus, and especially regarding his message, his teachings, is a gamble. We place our faith in the box or boxes we believe to be true, and roll the dice throughout our lives, living inspired or not by those beliefs. Without security of anything, without knowing what is going to come out on the roulette wheel. The wheel turns, our time is up, and the bet is on. A truth, I trust, will await us at the end of this road, whatever it may be, whether we have succeeded or not. And meanwhile, those of us who seek will move in the swampy mists of doubts, and in the blinding light of ideological fanaticism those who believe they are without them. Be that as it may, there can only be one truth, and it may not be anyone's truth. Perhaps there was a Jesus of Nazareth who was much more than any being, not even an angel, could understand. Perhaps it was an oddity of the universe, something inexcapable for the most brilliant-minded being. Or perhaps we are deceived and such a being cannot exist. Perhaps a man can never combine two different natures at the same time. To be a man and at the same time and in an incomprehensible way, to be heavenly. What I do know is that no one will ever be able to tell me, with evidence in hand, “You can't believe that.” To do this he will have to prove that the supernatural is false. And how to prove that something is false of which we have no facts? with evidence in hand, “you can't believe that.” To do this he will have to prove that the supernatural is false. And how to prove that something is false of which we have no facts? with evidence in hand, “you can't believe that.” To do this he will have to prove that the supernatural is false. And how to prove that something is false of which we have no facts?

# Cleaning the temple 

This is one of the worst understood and most misrepresented episodes of life of Jesus. In many books it has been called “the expulsion of the merchants from the temple” or similar things, but it is the way of understanding how this event occurred that completely distorts the authentic and genuine personality of Jesus. 

## The context situation

The temple in Jerusalem was the religious center and focus of the Jews at the time of Jesus. All the hopes and spiritual longings of the people of that time passed through this sanctuary of the holy city. Unfortunately, this attention had also led to commercial opportunism on the part of those who saw pilgrimages and cultural rites as a way of earning substantial money.

Large businesses related to religious services and ceremonies were carried out in this temple. There was a flourishing trade to provide the right animals for the various sacrifices. Although it was permissible for the interested party to provide his own animal for sacrifice, this animal had to be free from all “defects” in the sense that it had to meet certain prescriptions of the Levitical law, and in addition, it had to pass an inspection by the temple officials. These inspectors followed an interpretation of the law, which, as is easy to imagine, was not exempt from all kinds of abuses. Consequently, it had become almost general practice to acquire sacrificial animals in the temple itself, buying them from vendors who set up stalls in the courtyards. This lucrative business As it could not be less, it did not go unnoticed by the priestly leaders. Part of the profits made inside the holy precinct were bound to go to the temple treasury, but the largest portion ended up indirectly in the hands of the families of the high priests. Only a small portion, although very appetizing, ended up in the hands of the vendors themselves.

This sale of sacrificial victims prospered because, when someone came to perform a sacrifice and acquire an animal, even if the price inside the temple was a little higher, he had the guarantee that the offering would not be rejected because of possible real defects. or imaginary. There was the case at some time of practices of exorbitant surcharges to the people, especially during the great national holidays. At one time, some greedy priests even demanded the equivalent of a week's work in exchange for a couple of pigeons, when in fact they should be sold to poor people for a few cents. These practices, more or less accentuated, continued at the time of Jesus, and even after his death, until three years before the destruction of the temple, in 67 AD,

However, the traffic of animals and other merchandise was not the only way in which the holy places were profaned. At that time there was an extensive system of banking and commercial exchange that took place directly within the precincts of the temple.

During the Hasmonean dynasty (164-63 BC) the Jews minted their own silver coinage, and it had become common practice to require half-shekel temple fees and all other levies to be paid in this coin. This regulation required the authorization of a small number of moneychangers to exchange the many types of currency in circulation throughout Palestine and other provinces of the Roman Empire at this shekel of Jewish coinage. The temple tax per person, to be paid by everyone except women, slaves and children, was half a shekel, a coin about the size of today's euro but easily worth about 180 euros. To make matters worse, at the time of Jesus, the priests had also been exempted from paying temple fees. Therefore, Between the 15th and 25th of the month before Passover, accredited moneychangers set up their stalls in the main cities of Palestine, in order to provide the Jews with the appropriate money to pay the temple fees upon arrival in Jerusalem. After this ten-day period, these money changers moved to Jerusalem and set up their currency exchange tables in the temple courts. They were allowed to charge a commission of 30, or even more, 40% of the value of what was sold, and in the case of coins of greater value they could even double. Similarly, these temple bankers earned by exchanging all currency for the purchase of sacrificial animals and for the payment of vows and offerings. in order to provide the Jews with the appropriate money to pay the temple fees upon arrival in Jerusalem.

Similarly, these temple bankers earned by exchanging all currency for the purchase of sacrificial animals and for the payment of vows and offerings.

These temple money changers not only had this lucrative banking trade for the exchange of more than twenty types of coins that could be used by pilgrims arriving in Jerusalem, but they also carried out any other type of transaction typical of a bank. Both the temple treasury and its rectors made huge sums of money from these exchanges. It was not uncommon for the temple treasury to contain in coins of the time plus twelve million euros of today, while the common people languished in poverty and continued to be forced to pay these unjust contributions. 

## The position of Jesus

It was in the midst of this noisy crowd of moneychangers, merchants, and cattle dealers this Monday morning that Jesus attempted to teach the gospel of the kingdom of heaven. He was not the only one to resent this desecration of the temple; the common people, especially Jewish visitors from foreign provinces, were also deeply disturbed by this degradation of the holy place.

The Master had criticized it on numerous occasions, like all the many absurd self-imposed religious practices by the leaders of his nation. However, he had never intended to take any action with the aim of ending this trade. Jesus well knew that attempting it would have been futile and reckless, since it would have led to an immediate arrest, and of course, the priestly leaders would not have missed the opportunity to accuse him before Rome of being a troublemaker. Faced with this panorama, of no solution, Jesus had opted for calm and for trying to continue with his preaching whenever that chaos allowed it. 

## What happened

So what happened that morning? If we read the gospels and some books that comment on them, we will see that there are many authors who do not hesitate to affirm that Jesus arrived at the temple that day with the firm intention of expelling, by force if necessary, these merchants and money changers. They do not, however, give satisfactory explanations as to why Jesus chose to do this daring action on this day, and not on any of the many other occasions on which he visited the holy city. Nor do they explain how it is possible that a single man, with a whip in his hand, apparently, managed to sweep everything away, taking men and animals with him.

I believe that all these perceptions are very far from the authentic personality of the Master, and that, letting themselves be carried away by evangelical literature, many authors have distorted Jesus with characters of sudden angry reactions.

That morning Jesus did not go to the temple with the sure purpose of dismantling that corruption. The Rabbi, rather, came to preach inside the courtyards of the sanctuary as he had done in the usual way. The Sanhedrin, fortunately, had been frightened by the popular explosion that had occurred the day before, and they hesitated to arrest the Master for fear of possible reprisals from the people. The Sanhedrin, of course, did not appreciate that this popular outburst had not really been sincere, but only superficially provoked, and they feared that Jesus was in favor with the crowd.

The point is that this fear of the Sanhedrin allowed Jesus to enter the temple this Monday without problems and without any signs that they could disturb him. However, when he had barely been preaching for a few minutes, several occasional circumstances that occurred at the same time triggered such a deep indignation in Jesus, that together with his disapproval of the temple trade, they gave rise to some events. Those circumstances (a few louder cries, a boy who is not capable of controlling a herd of oxen and a group of pilgrims in full mockery of a follower of the Master), were more than enough. Jesus at no time attacked any person, neither with his hands nor with any whip. What's more, no one was injured or bruised. Things happened completely differently.

What Jesus did is just energetically approach the boy who was driving the oxen, and after seizing his whip, redirect the cattle to their destination so that they would not bother them anymore. When he got there, in the pens, with that deep indignation that he carried, he started one by one and opened all the cages, letting the animals free, who fled in terror seeing their chance to escape. This evidently caused the confusion of the merchants, who instead of attacking Jesus, worried about the animals, tried to recover them.

And the real expulsion of the merchants happened from here, and it was not the work of Jesus. A large group of pilgrims who resented that trade, fired up by the action of Jesus, took advantage of the chaos to overturn all the tables of the stalls, spilling merchandise and scattering coins. The animals were then completely herded from the pens to the cattle entrance and exit gates. And finally, with threats and surely brandishing their hands, they took the merchants out of there and stationed themselves at the doors so as not to let anyone enter. And all this in just a few minutes.

This tumult, which of course was noticed by the temple guards, and what is worse, by the Romans who guarded the temple, disappeared as quickly as it had formed, that by the time they appeared in the courtyards, everything seemed calm and calmed down. Calmer than usual. 

Nor should a mistake be made in considering this expulsion of the merchants. The pilgrims did not expel each and every one of the merchants who were at that time in the so-called Esplanade of the Gentiles. This enclosure was very large (about 300 x 400 m), and only those who were in the area near where Jesus preached were evicted.

During all that time that the expulsion lasted, neither Jesus nor his apostles or immediate followers moved a muscle. And this happened this way because if we remember they had precise instructions from Jesus not to carry out any public action.

Therefore, Jesus limited himself to eliminating that element that bothered him for his preaching: the immense shouting of the animals that was taking place for a few minutes. His intention was not to drive those people out of there, but to draw their attention to the fact that this was a chaos that could not be allowed. The event, if it had not been continued by the pilgrims who supported it, would have ended in a slight dialectical battle between Jesus and the sellers, they would have returned the animals to their cages, and everything would have continued the same. On the contrary, the impetus of those pilgrims meant that no merchant was allowed to pass that morning.

The proof of all the above is that Jesus, the next day, returned to preach in the temple, and did not try to expel anyone from there. The vendors, however, as we can guess, set up their tables again and continued their sales. 

## Jesus' attitude towards the use of force 

We would not complete this commentary on today's events, however, if we did not refer to Jesus' attitude towards the use of force. 

To begin with, Jesus was a peaceful man. He was a man of peace. He didn't wish harm on anyone, not even on his bitterest enemies. He did not seek to impose himself on anyone, nor rival anyone. He never used force to impose himself on another person. Jesus always used the technique of returning good for evil.

When a person attacks us, the malformed instinct pushes us to attack the aggressor in turn. Retaliation is usually considered justified, implying that with it we prevent something worse from happening to us, which is logical. But the technique is imperfect, because the evil answered with evil only generates a greater evil. What usually happens if we respond to an aggression is that the aggressor in turn wants to continue. Jesus always encouraged his followers to fight evil - not passively - but through good. In this case, Jesus avoided inflicting any derision on the vendors, nor of course on the boy who drove the animals (probably these people had no real intention of bothering Jesus), but he eliminated only that element that bothered him, the noise and the mess of the esplanade.

Jesus' philosophy in the face of physical aggression was similar. If someone attacks you, it is logical that you move away, even that you parry the blow. But it is not lawful for you to respond in your turn with another blow. There is no justification for retaliation! If there is an element that disturbs our peace, without us having provoked it, it is fair to eliminate said element. But don't provoke another one. In an unjustified attack on Jesus on one occasion, the Master simply said: “If I said something wrong, why do you hit me instead of telling me what it was?” That is, he calmly asked his attacker about the cause of the attack, but he did not physically or verbally attack his attacker.

Faced with the unjust and enslaving practices that many powerful people of the time exercised against Jesus' contemporaries, the Master demonstrated a determination to fight for his defense. The Rabbi detested this demeaning marketing of the temple that only served to oppress the nation. He renounced such practices, and so he had this sudden reaction. In this way, Jesus justified any natural reaction to the enslaving and oppressive activities of all peoples and of all times, but he gave us an example of temperance. There is no justification for the reparation, for the angry response. We must go to the root of the problems, not to generate another with our desire to fight. 

# The Last Supper

The last supper of Jesus with his apostles is one of those events that has been so long debated that it has ended up being given an importance and interest that do not correspond to what really happened. 

The simple message of Jesus, that «we are children of God, free beings, endowed with creativity to express our religious feelings», was entangled and complicated with dialectical battles about ceremonies, rites and miraculous events, moving away from the content of the central message. 

But why so much debate? What is vitally important in the words of Jesus at this last supper? 

## An Easter dinner

All four Gospels state that Jesus' Last Supper was celebrated in the context of Passover, the annual festival or celebration that took place and still takes place among the Jews today. 

This Passover could be celebrated in the usual place of residence, but the common thing and what was done whenever possible was to celebrate it in Jerusalem. People arrived in the city a week before the celebrations, in order to purify themselves, which meant doing a series of rituals in the temple.

Easter dinner used to be prepared at least a day in advance. A series of preparations were required that could not be left to the last minute. These preparations included finding a place to hold the Passover banquet, buying the lamb or kid, performing purification rituals, and holding the meal. 

In the time of Jesus, Jerusalem was a city enclosed within walls much smaller than we could imagine today. As the crowds invaded the city, it was little more than impossible to find accommodation in the city in these days so crowded with people from all over the world.

The gospels tell that the apostles asked Jesus about the preparation of this Passover dinner, and he indicated a place where they prepared everything as he had asked them. 

## The problem of the date 

Since the last supper is a Passover supper, it is logical to think that it was celebrated on the same day as the feast. However, it was not. 

The Jewish holiday of Passover, in fact, included 8 days from Nisan 14 to 21 (Nisan being the first month of the Jewish calendar, which corresponded with our March to April, since there is no exact correspondence between the two calendars):

* On Nisan 14, the Passover meal was celebrated at sunset (for the Jews the new day began at sunset, when the sun went down, so the preparation day for Passover was Nisan 13, and the Passover meal marked, therefore, the beginning of the next day, Nisan 14), 
* from Nisan 15 to 21 the festival of the unleavened fruit (called the _massot_) was celebrated. 


The Gospels also tell us that that year of Jesus' death was doubly festive, because the 15th of Nisan fell on a Saturday, which was also a solemn day for the Jews, so it was a year in which followed by the two festivals, that of _nisán_ 14 (Passover itself), and that of Nisán 15 (the first day of the massot, which that year coincided on a Saturday).

However, the gospels do not coincide when it comes to determining the date of the last supper: 

* The gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke speak of Jesus celebrating the Passover dinner, that is, the dinner that took place at the end of the Nisan 13, at sunset, and which marked the beginning of _nisán_ 14. 
* The Gospel of John, on the other hand, says that the meal was not the Passover meal, but a meal held the day before the Passover, that is, at sunset on Nisan 12, when Nisan 13 began. 

Who is right?

At first glance we have to say that it is John who is correct. If not, it is not explained how the enemies of Jesus could arrest him and execute him the day after the dinner. If Matthew, Mark, and Luke were right, Jesus celebrated the Last Supper and was executed on Nisan 14, which is impossible. From sunset on the 13th, which marked the beginning of the 14th, according to Jewish law, all activity was prohibited. The Jewish magistrates would not have been able to hold his trial against Jesus, nor demand Jesus' death before Pilate, nor attend the crucifixions. The Jewish holidays were a holy day on which all kinds of work were prohibited. 

Then obviously the Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke were wrong.

But if we take John's chronology as true, a problem arises: did Jesus and his apostles celebrate the Passover meal one day before the day it was required to be held? John says that they celebrated supper on the day of the preparation of the passover (see Jn 13:1). How is this explained? 

Some scholars have raised various hypotheses to try to explain John's apparent contradiction. Martín Descalzo, in his book «Jesús de Nazaret», summarized some of these explanations:

* _Essene theory_: according to this hypothesis (defended by Jaubert and Ruckstuhl) Jesus celebrated the Passover meal like the Essenes. We know that the members of this Jewish sect at the time of Jesus, separated from the rest of the people, had their own separate celebrations and did not observe the same cult as the rest of the people. They celebrated the Passover meal always at sunset on a Tuesday, regardless of the date on which it fell. 
	
	However, neither was Jesus an Essene, as some convoluted writers want him to appear, nor is there any discrepancy that the dinner was on a Thursday.
* _Theory of discrepancy in the date among the Jews_: according to this, the Jews did not have a clear date for the celebration of the Passover meal. It could be on Wednesday, Thursday or Friday. And those who elaborate this theory (Chwolson, Klausner, Zolli, Lagrange, Strack, Billerbeck, Lichtenstein) suppose that the Galileans could celebrate or were in the habit of celebrating the Passover meal a day before.
	
	However, the text of the gospels does nothing but assume that in Jerusalem there was only one date for the Passover meal and for the ritual celebrations of the Passover. It is possible and even admissible that in the district of Galilee a change could have been made in the dates, since Galilee was a somewhat more liberal region in the fulfillment of religious rituals. But it is clear that this did not happen in Jerusalem. That liberalism could not exist there in the celebrations and it is impossible that there was a discrepancy regarding the dates.
* _Theory of liberality in choosing the date_: this theory, closely related to the previous one (defended by J. Pickl), suggests that Jesus would have joined the custom of his time of choosing the most convenient date for dinner Easter, given the high number of pilgrims in Jerusalem for the festival and the scarcity of houses.
	
	However, there was no liberality regarding the day of the celebrations. In addition, in the time of Jesus, when one was in the vicinity of Jerusalem, one had the obligation to celebrate the Passover meal inside the city and it could not be celebrated outside the walls. For this reason, the rabbis had established that a large sector that surrounded the walls and where a large crowd of pilgrims, who camped in the open air in tents and in nearby camps, was considered as included within the city. This is precisely what Jesus was doing on the Mount of Olives.
	
	Another fact that denies this theory is that at least ten diners had to meet in each house. This was due to the imposition of the law according to which nothing of the Passover lamb was to be left for the following day. You had to eat it all. That is why a sufficient number of guests gathered so as not to leave any remains, and this is confirmed by the fact that Jesus meets with the twelve. Therefore, we can say that it is true that there was a shortage of space in Jerusalem, but that the necessary adjustments had already been made at that time to overcome this stumbling block. Therefore, a change of date to overcome this problem of lack of space is not justifiable.

No one who has studied the problem has thought of a more obvious solution. They all revolve their explanations around something foreign to Jesus: the Essenes, the Jews of his time, the scarcity of space in Jerusalem... But why does no one want to see a possible explanation in Jesus himself? 

Jesus celebrates an atypical and not allowed Passover meal, which of course should have caused strangeness in his apostles (unless they were already used to these extraordinary situations by Jesus). Besides:

* Jesus knew that they were going to arrest him and had announced it. The evangelists seem to imply that he even knew who was going to betray him (Judas) and when. He seemed to sense when the arrest was going to take place, obviously before the party. If Jesus wanted to celebrate a last supper with his friends, he could not wait for the usual date, because by that day the Jews would have captured him.
* Jesus' supper was private. The evangelists tell it this way: Jesus ate this dinner only with the twelve. (Some pious have wanted to see, in light of the events that took place at this dinner, the presence of other people, such as Mary, the mother of Jesus, but it is all an attempt to want to adapt an event to the taste of piety popular). Dinner was private. In fact, the Gospel account seems to suggest that there were not even servants, because it was Jesus who had the decision to do the servile work of washing feet (performing ablutions and lavatories before a ritual feast such as Easter was something obligatory). and well seen).
* Thanks to the Gospel of John we know that during dinner Jesus makes a long speech, with a clear tone of farewell. He wants to eat a last supper with his closest friends to give them his goodbyes and his last advice. 

Therefore, it must be concluded that it is Jesus himself who expressly violates the custom and tradition of the Passover meal. He celebrates an Easter dinner outside the obligatory date, something unusual in those days, and he does it because _the circumstances of his life compel him to do so_ and because _Jesus defended liberality in rituals against the priestly rigidity of his time_ .

Jesus could have celebrated any dinner with his friends, if his only objective had been to say goodbye to them. But he purposely wants to hold a Passover meal. He wants to develop in the context of this supper a series of important things for the apostles. He doesn't want it to be just any dinner. And that's why he doesn't mind altering the traditional date of the Passover meal to celebrate it on the day he knew he would still have time to do it.

Here's the thing: _Jesus was liberal and flexible with the rituals and religious practices of his day_. This liberality of Jesus is a fact that is constantly shown in the Gospels: Jesus is recriminated by the most ritualistic sector of his time, the Pharisees, because he did not carry out the usual and customary washing of cups and plates, nor did he ritually wash his hands before eating; they also blame him for not teaching his disciples to fast, as John the Baptist did; he puts love and mercy for his neighbor before the celebration of sacrifices to ask for God's forgiveness; his own disciples often do not understand his words that “it is not what enters through the mouth that contaminates a man, but what comes out of the heart.”

Therefore, it should not surprise us that Jesus would go so far as to celebrate a Jewish ritual as solemn as Passover on a day more suited to his intentions. A careful reading of the Gospel shows us a Jesus respectful of religious practices as long as they do not reach the height of rigidity and lack of meaning. And here we have one more proof of this fact, by choosing a different date than usual as the day for the celebration of this unique dinner. 

## The meaning of Easter

The Passover meal evoked for the Jews the memory of leaving Egypt and how God helped them escape from the Egyptians. He remembered those days when Moses was his guide in that adventure of fleeing from Egypt. It recalled the liberation of the Jewish people from the chains of slavery to which they were subjected. For these Jews, the Passover meal meant liberation from the oppression of neighboring peoples. The Jews were a very proud people. Many times they had fallen under foreign domination, and in the time of Jesus this domination came from Rome. But so many other times, their small victories had made them reborn in the hope that they were a people chosen by God, placed at the head of peoples, and this liberation from Egypt magnified those feats that their ancestors performed in such distant times.

The ceremonial dinner followed this custom: 

1. Sitting at the table, at sunset, the preparation of the first drink takes place. The father or head of the table pronounces a blessing, the _qiddus_, and then the cup is drunk. 
2. An aperitif based on celery (_carpas_) bathed in salt was eaten. 
3. Then came the _yachatz_, the division into two pieces of one of the three unleavened breads. The larger piece was kept aside, while the smaller piece was left together with the other unleavened bread. 
4. Then the second cup was poured, and the pesá or paschal rite took place: the father or head of the table asked the question about the meaning of the food to a child or diner, and he explained the meaning of each thing.
5. A third cup, or blessing cup, was then poured. This is where Jesus introduced a variant on the words that were spoken before drinking. 
6. Then the unleavened bread was distributed, a small portion to each diner and a blessing (_motzi_) was pronounced before eating them. Jesus also altered the usual words of this blessing. 
7. Then the first course was continued, the starter, which consisted of various bitter vegetables (_maror_), which were made more digestible by dipping them in a sauce called jarôset. They also offered each other pieces of bread spread with sauce and vegetables.
8. Normally, the Easter lamb or kid (one year old) would come later. However, as the Urantia Book says very well, Jesus had altered this custom and no lamb was roasted at the Passover dinners where he presided over the table. For Jesus, the lamb represented an idea of ​​sacrifice with which he did not agree. Something that Christians have curiously distorted, as we will see later. 
9. The piece of unleavened bread that had been set aside was left for last. 
10. Finally the Hallel was sung (Ps 115-118) and a fourth cup was still drunk after blessing it or Hallel cup. Then dinner was over. Diners used to continue it until late at night talking and having a good time. 

The entire dinner was loaded with symbolism and meaning:

* The wine glasses: they expressed the joy of the Jewish people for having been taken out of Egypt. 
* Unleavened bread (unleavened bread, _matzah_): expressed the departure of the Jewish people from Egypt, since they left in a hurry and the breads they took on their trip were breads that had not been given time to ferment. 
* Bitter herbs (_maror_): a very chopped horseradish to produce tears and that expressed bitterness for the slavery of their ancestors. 
* The sauce (_jarôset_): represented the mortar with which the Jewish slaves had to build the constructions of the pharaoh. 
* Celery or parsley (_carpas_) bathed in salt to commemorate the taste of the exodus.
* Lettuce or salad (_jazeret_): it was taken with the radish and could have been some plant that the Jews ate in the desert.
* The Passover lamb: it expressed the compassionate behavior of God, who killed all the firstborn of the Egyptians and saved those of the Jews, because they stained the doorposts with the blood of the lambs. The name “Passover”, which is the Latin word, comes from _pesach_, which in Hebrew means “passage”, or “sweeping”, because God passed and swept the Egyptians. In conclusion, the lamb had a meaning of death to the enemies of Israel and that is why the animal was killed. Animal sacrifice was a constant ritual practice in those days, not only among Jews, but among all civilized people. The idea was held that divine favor was gained through the blood of the innocent animal victim, and that there was no divine hearing if these bloody acts were not performed. Nevertheless, Christians no longer eat the Passover lamb. It is evident that Jesus influenced this decision because He had that custom.

The meaning of the Passover meal, therefore, was to remember a special day in which God had manifested himself: the departure from Egypt and his liberation, which had been indelibly engraved in the memory of the Jews. 

## What Jesus 

did Did Jesus want to introduce a new type of ceremony, the “Eucharist”, at this Last Supper? Did he establish a new ritual by which to replace the traditional Jewish Passover dinner, eliminating the lamb, and with the possibility of repeating it whenever one wanted? Or was it all a later invention of the early Christians?

Jesus celebrated a Passover meal with total normality. At this dinner the lamb was not eaten, but the sauce with vegetables was eaten, and there was plenty of unleavened bread. However, when the third cup, the blessing cup, was about to be drunk, Jesus spoke different words that have never been well understood. 

Jesus took the cup, blessed it, spoke a few words of explanation about the meaning of the cup, and then everyone drank from that cup. Then Jesus did the same with a loaf of unleavened bread, cutting it into pieces, giving an explanation of its meaning, and everyone eating the bread. 

However, the idea that many Christians today have of the words that Jesus said, and what they meant, is wrong.

The texts of the Gospels and a letter from Paul tell us of a kind of ritual formula, as if Jesus wanted to establish a new Easter rite. However, they do not tell us that Jesus fixed the frequency, or that he sanctioned certain ways and means (such as that it be celebrated in a sacred place, or that there was a person who conducted the operations). Honestly, it is hard to believe that with those words of Jesus, all the apostles understood that their Master was asking them to carry out a new type of ritual in the future, and that everyone was clear about the ways and means of celebrating it. 

## The texts of the “institution of the Eucharist”

It is much more logical to think that those words of Jesus, long after the Last Supper, were remembered and misunderstood, becoming a new ritual that distinguished that new religious formation that originated as a result of Jesus' message, Christianity. And to elaborate their ritual, they even had the gall to borrow an existing ritual, that of the Mithraist celebration of 'twinning'.

Much of the origin and explanation of everything must be found in the apostle Paul, who infused Mithraist ideas into the message of Jesus. Paul lived in Tarsus, a city in present-day Turkey, and in Paul's youthful days, the city of Tarsus had one main religion: Mithraism. The study and analysis of this religion explains, in amazing detail, why Christians give the Eucharist the meaning it has today, influenced by Mithraist ideas.

In a graffito preserved in a Mithraeum on the Aventine (ca. 200. AD) one can read the words pronounced by a Mithraist priest during a ceremony in honor of the god Mithras: “You saved men with the shedding of eternal blood.” The legends about Mithras, moreover, are full of sacrificial acts where Mithras kills a bull whose blood allows hundreds of new lives to be created. In fact, even the most important ceremony in Mithraism was a banquet where believers (mistas) ate bread and wine. Considering that Mithraism was a religion of Persian origin that was widespread when Jesus began to preach, it is obvious that Jesus' original message was greatly influenced after his death by these Persian ideas.

These ideas were not in the preaching of Jesus. They were non-Jewish ideas. Let us remember that Paul was a Jew by descent, but he lived in Greek territory throughout his youth, and on top of that he was a Roman citizen by birth. His ideology was undoubtedly much more influenced by non-Jewish concepts. And it was from these concepts that he derived the erroneous theory, still perpetuated by Christians today, of the atonement for sin and the symbolism of the Eucharist: that Jesus died to settle an ancient debt to God for which eternal life was forbidden to humanity, and that through this expiation of human sins suffered in Jesus himself, a new era was opened for humanity by which we could aspire to a life beyond death.

Paul, in his good intention to win many Gentile converts, sought to incorporate into his preaching elements of the pagan rituals of the day, mixed with the elements he inherited from the teachings about Jesus. And this is what originated the current concept of the Eucharist. 

The idea that Jesus was establishing a new type of alliance, a new Passover, to obtain the total and definitive remission of sins through the atonement that he would achieve with his death, was associated with wine and bread. unleavened 

These foods came to mean the blood and flesh of Jesus, who was going to be handed over and executed with suffering. This suffering was understood as necessary to atone for humanity's racial guilt due to the lack of the first parents, Adam and Eve.

However, if we only had four Gospel texts on the Eucharist, there would be no possible doubt. But the truth is that we have forgotten that there is another text. What does the Gospel of John say? In it we find the key to the authentic words of Jesus. 

## The Gospel of John

The Gospel of John is the only one that says nothing about the words of Jesus at the Last Supper about the Eucharist. And there is nothing more strange. How is it possible that an event of such magnitude and importance as the Eucharist could go completely unnoticed by Juan? We even know that this gospel is the last one written. Therefore, the author of the gospel must already have known the other texts and stories of the Eucharist. Why didn't he add his version? Was he not in agreement with the official version of the other texts? 

Despite the apparent silence, John is the evangelist who tells the most about the Last Supper. So much so that the content of John's narrative of the Last Supper is about ten times longer than that of the other Gospels.

Thanks to John we know that Jesus, at the last supper, gave a very long speech, which we could call the _farewell speech_, extending profusely and giving all kinds of details. The narrator even allowed himself to analyze some of the words and contents of what Jesus said, giving additional explanations. 

But, if he gives such a long speech at the last supper, why does nothing count about the words of Jesus when instituting the eucharist? Do you disagree with the other three evangelists? Don't you think Jesus instituted anything? Is he meaning by his silence that none of those words from the other gospels were actually spoken? 

## The meaning of the farewell speech

Jesus celebrates a last supper to say goodbye to his friends, and the speech he addresses to them has a clear tone of farewell. Jesus announces to them that he is going to leave, but that in his place, a strange substitute was going to take his place. John refers to him by different names: the “New Teacher”, the “Spirit of Truth”, but the apostles do not understand what he tells them. Jesus warns them that when he leaves they will feel afflicted, but then, after a few days, they will be filled with joy for the events that were to come. 

And these events are what Jesus really wanted his apostles to remember. The authentic meaning of Jesus' words was to solemnize the moment of the arrival of this Spirit, and to establish a new memory, but based on his person and his life.

And the proof that this was the true meaning of his words is offered by the Gospel of John in other passages. 

## Other passages on the Eucharist in John 

In many passages of the Gospel of John we find words with an amazing similarity of content to those of the Eucharist of the Last Supper collected by the other evangelists. Interestingly, these passages that John collects do not appear in the other evangelists. 

### The Samaritan woman of Sychar at Jacob's well (Jn 4 1-42)

According to the story, Jesus, after spending the Passover in Jerusalem, marches with his disciples to Galilee and they take the road to Samaria. Passing near a town called Sychar, where there was a very famous well, Jacob's well, Jesus stops to rest, while the apostles approach the town to buy provisions. In this, a Samaritan woman arrives to get water from the well, and Jesus, who was thirsty from the trip and had nothing to draw water with, asks her to help him. This is the excerpt from the conversation between Jesus and the woman, Jn 4:9-15: 


> The Samaritan woman said to Jesus: 
> —How is it that you, being a Jew, dare to ask me for water, a Samaritan woman? (It is to be noted that the Jews and the Samaritans were not related). 
> Jesus replied:
> —If you knew the gift of God and who it is that asks you for a drink, without a doubt you yourself would ask me and I would give you living water. 
> The woman answered: 
> —Lord, if you don't even have anything to draw water with, and the well is deep, how can you give me living water? Our father Jacob left us this well from which he himself drank, his children and his cattle. Do you consider yourself older than him? 
> Jesus replied: 
> —Everyone who drinks this water will thirst again; On the other hand, whoever drinks the water that I want to give him will never be thirsty again. Because the water that I want to give her will become a spring inside her from which eternal life will emerge. 
> Then the woman exclaimed:
> —Lord, give me that water; That way I won't be thirsty anymore and I won't have to come here to quench it. 

Jesus speaks in this passage of an enigmatic “living water.” Enigmatic because the Samaritan woman does not understand Jesus well and she believes that she is talking about the water from the well. It is not like this. And Jesus explains her words again, telling her that it is not water to drink, but water of a different nature, water that whoever drinks it will live forever.

Obviously, Jesus, as he does many times, uses comparisons to try to convey a higher teaching. It assimilates the concept of drink, which is the support of man, due to the need that we all have for water, the concept of the superior support of man, which is “like a living drink”, which gives a life beyond it. But what drink is he talking about? What is the concept of this drink assimilated to? What is it that you seek to symbolize in the “living water”? 

### Discourse on the bread of life and the water of life in Capernaum (Jn 6 22-71)

Jesus, after arriving in Galilee from Samaria, makes another trip to Jerusalem for another festival, and then returns to Galilee. At the lake he performs one of his most spectacular miracles: he feeds five thousand people. They try to proclaim him king for this miracle, but Jesus, seeing his intentions, withdraws and avoids them. He crosses the lake and the next day people find him in Capernaum. Jesus reproaches them for the fact that his intentions in seeking him are not sincere. This is the excerpt, Jn 6:26-64: 

> Jesus answered them:
> —I assure you that you are not looking for me because of the signs you have seen, but because you ate your fill of bread. Make an effort, not to get the transitory food, but the permanent one, the one that gives eternal life. This food will be given to you by the Son of Man, because God, the Father, has accredited it with his seal. 
> Then they asked him: 
> —What must we do to act as God wants? 
> Jesus replied: 
> —What God expects of you is that you believe in the one he has sent. 
> They replied: 
> —What sign can you offer us so that, when we see it, we believe you? What is your work? Our ancestors ate the manna in the desert, as the scripture says: he gave them bread from heaven to eat. 
> Jesus replied:
> —I assure you that it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven. It is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven. The bread of God comes from heaven and gives life to the world. 
> Then they said to him: 
> —Lord, always give us that bread. 
> Jesus replied:
> —I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be hungry again; whoever believes in me will never thirst. But you, as I have already told you, do not believe, despite having seen. All that the Father gives me will come to me, and I will never reject the one who comes to me. For I have come down from heaven, not to do my will, but the will of the one who sent me. And his will is that I should not lose any of those he has given me, but rather raise them up on the last day. My Father wants all who see the Son and believe in him to have eternal life, and I will resurrect them on the last day. 
> The Jews began to murmur about him, because he had said: I am the bread that came down from heaven. They said: 
> —This is Jesus, the son of Joseph. We know his father and his mother.
> Jesus replied: 
> —Don't go on murmuring. Nobody can accept me, if the Father, who sent me, does not grant it to him; and I will raise him up on the last day. It is written in the prophets: And they will all be instructed by God. Everyone who listens to the Father and receives his teaching accepts me. This does not mean that someone has seen the Father. Only he who has come from God has seen the Father. I assure you that he who believes has eternal life. I am the bread of life. Your fathers ate the manna in the desert and yet they died. This is the bread from heaven, and it has come down so that whoever eats it does not die. 
> Jesus added: 
> —I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Whoever eats this bread will live forever. And the bread that I will give is my flesh. I give it for the life of the world.
> This provoked a strong discussion among the Jews, who asked themselves: 
> —How can this man give us his meat to eat? 
> Jesus said to them: 
> “I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you will have no life in you.” He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him up on the last day. My flesh is true food and my blood is true drink. He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood lives in me and I in him. The Father, who has sent me, possesses life, and I live for him. So too, whoever eats me will live because of me. This is the bread that has come down from heaven; not like the bread your ancestors ate. They died; but whoever eats this bread will live forever.
> Jesus exposed all this while teaching in the synagogue of Capernaum. 
> Many of his disciples, hearing Jesus, said: 
> —This doctrine is inadmissible. Who can accept it? 
> Jesus, knowing that his disciples criticized his teaching, asked them: 
> - Is it difficult for you to accept this? What would happen if you saw the Son of Man go up to where he was before? The Spirit is the one who gives life; meat is useless. The words I have spoken to you are spirit and life. But some of you do not believe.

Jesus preaches a novel teaching. So novel that it provokes the indignation of his listeners, who were Jews. Jesus claims to be, through his mortal life, the authentic heavenly bread and drink for the sustenance of those who wish to attain eternal life. Unlike the “bread from heaven” in which the Jews of his time believed, the manna, and which according to them enabled their ancestors to be believed, Jesus sets himself up as the authentic bread from heaven. Perhaps the most clarifying phrase of this entire text is in Jn 6:35. We read: 

> «-I am the bread of life. He who comes to me will never be hungry again; whoever believes in me will never thirst." 

_That is, the bread from heaven consists of the attitude of those who seek Jesus and walk towards him, and the water of life is faith in Jesus and in his message _.

Jn says it clearly: “he who comes to me” and “he who believes in me”. The food and drink that Jesus speaks of are not material. He gives them material symbolism, likening them to bread and water (or wine as in the Last Supper), because he wants to inspire his listeners to understand the deep meaning of his words. But_ what Jesus is really saying is that the attitude of seeking the right path (the one that leads to Jesus) and the sincere faith of those who put his teachings into practice are the authentic spiritual nourishment that leads humanity to salvation from humanity. eternal life_. Jesus speaks of something mobile, not static, he speaks of seeking him and believing in him.

When Jesus speaks of “eating his life in the flesh” and “drinking his life in the blood,” he is obviously not referring to taking material food and drink. He refers to following Jesus and believing in his teachings. His flesh is the life that he lives for the example and inspiration of those who want to follow him, and his blood is also that same life of preaching made so that those who believe in his teachings feel full and overflowing with life. Hence Jesus says: 

> «He who eats my life in the flesh and drinks my life in the blood lives in me and I in him».

Jesus speaks of participating in his human life, in flesh and blood. His life was the living divine example so that those who want to know the way to heaven have a guide in Jesus. His life is the inspiration of the man and woman who yearn for God. The human life of Jesus is that living path that transports us towards eternal life. And this is the meaning of “living his life,” as if we ate and drank from it, just as we need food and drink to live. 

### The Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem (Jn 7 1- 8 59)

Jesus has returned to Galilee, and tries not to return to Jerusalem because they seek to kill him. However, with great courage, he ignores the danger and shows up in Jerusalem for the Jewish festival of tents or tabernacles. There Jesus delivers several speeches in the temple. The excerpt is from one of them, Jn 7:37-39: 

> On the last day, the most important of the feast, Jesus, standing before the crowd, solemnly affirmed: 
> —If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink. As the scripture says: from the depths of everyone who believes in me, rivers of living water will flow. 
> He said this referring to the Spirit that would be received by those who believed in him. And it is that there was still no Spirit, because Jesus had not been glorified.


The phrase: “If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink” offers no room for doubt. He speaks of the water of life, of the wine of the Eucharist. And Jn makes the clarification that Jesus refers to the Spirit that would be received by believers who believed in him. 

Therefore, as we have already said, the water of life is faith in Jesus and in his message. Those who believe in him and put his teachings into practice receive heavenly food, which is the food of the spirit. The rivers of living water that will flow are those that produce that spiritual food. And that spiritual food is the Spirit of Truth, which feeds internally those who believe in Jesus and bring his teachings to their lives.

_The authentic meaning of the Eucharist at the Last Supper is that of remembering the day on which the new teacher was going to dwell in their hearts, the day on which Jesus, as a living spirit, was going to dwell within the heart of man to teach him the path of goodness and righteousness_.

_The “bread of life” and the “water of life” are for Jesus a happy and positive symbol of the spiritual food that must flood the hearts of believers: “follow Jesus” and “believe in him”. These foods will cause springs of vitality to spring up from within man thanks to the fact that Jesus promises to send a spiritual help to the heart of man, which is the Spirit of Truth, and in this way the authentic believer in Jesus is united with Him because He is installed in his heart and because the believer follows that teacher that he carries within_. 

## The liberality of Jesus

Few give much thought to what Jesus did that night: He changed ancient rituals! But Jesus was not inaugurating a new way of celebrating the old Passover. His intention was not to restrict human freedom and force a new type of celebration. Jesus was simply giving a lesson in freedom and using an ancient ritual as a means of further teaching and establishing a new type of commemoration. 

Jesus was a man _free_ to celebrate the rituals of his time at his pleasure and desire. _He was free!_ And he wanted to transmit that liberality to his disciples. He wanted to free them from the shackles of a ceremonialism based on outdated memories and useless ideas of atonement.

Throughout his life he ignored the Passover lambs and animal sacrifice. He destroyed forever the compulsory nature of ablutions and lavatories. He removed the entrenched ridiculousness of meaningless Sabbath rules, and openly challenged the idea that ceremonials were as or more important than good works.

It is deeply sad and shameful what the supposed followers of Jesus of different times have done and what their liberal act of that dinner has become. Jesus wanted to free his disciples from the slavery of meaningless ceremonies and the formalism and rigidity in the way of celebrating religious events. And today, almost two thousand years after this distant supper, today's Christians perpetuate the same error that Jesus wanted to correct: the lack of liberality in ritual forms. Why so much rigidity in the forms if the important thing is the content? Why has the Christian church been so determined to fix and establish the ways and means of celebrating the Eucharist? Is not the ecclesiastical ceremonial a fixed and established act? Aren't there books for priests where all the guidelines that must be followed in these celebrations are recorded?

We have gone backwards! There was no such rigidity in religious forms even at the time of Jesus, despite all that we have read about the rigidity of the Pharisees of those days. The authentic Pharisees of today hide behind those sacred vestments that officiate every holiday in the temples. That is where the worst Pharisees that history has known hide. Because not even the fact that Jesus came into the world was enough for them. Because they preach the same things that they then do not take care of doing. They preach that Jesus liberally changed the ritual of his time, and they do not allow one gesture or symbol of their ceremonies to be altered.

It is truly sad to observe that we have not yet been able, after all the effort that He made, to free ourselves from the shackles of rigid ceremonies, practiced without reflection, mechanically, out of habit, tradition and convenience. 

We have not progressed that far since his visit, and if he were to come back to earth today, he would also change the present Eucharistic ceremonial, and give it a different form. Because for Jesus there is nothing like _the freedom to express each one, in his own way and in his own way, the religious experience_. 

## Were the evangelists wrong?

Evidently the synoptic evangelists were wrong in their account of the Eucharist. They do not agree with the meaning that John expresses in his gospel and seem to ignore key passages in the life of Jesus where he spoke on similar issues. 

Why were they wrong? Do they not pick up the preaching of Jesus in a live voice? Did they misunderstand his words?

All the evangelists who mention the words of Jesus in the Eucharist base themselves on the preaching of Paul and not of Jesus. Marcos follows the preaching of Pedro, but this one as well, is influenced by Pablo; Mateo does nothing but faithfully follow Marcos, and gets into the same error as him. Luke, a direct disciple of Paul, gives the very same version, verbatim, as a preaching of Paul written in the letter to the Corinthians. Then the culprit of all this theory about the expiation of sins by the death of Jesus, and the meaning of bread and wine, is exclusively in the apostle Paul.

It was Paul who tried to establish regulations within an organization that was growing and growing without the direct control of the apostles. To gain authority he had himself called the “apostle of the Gentiles”, and set out to organize and give guidelines for all the communities of believers that were beginning to be established in Turkey, Greece and Rome.

Humanity has always fallen into the same situation and has never known how to solve it. The problem is called “desire for uniformity”, although in reality we are the ones who created the problem. Human beings love to establish rules and establish customs. The first Christian communities faced this problem. Each community began to celebrate a different commemoration dinner. And as always, someone appeared who arrogated a supposed authority to say “what would be the best way to celebrate.” First, minor rules were defined on trivial matters, but later it became customary to recite certain words, read certain texts, and finally, dinner ceased to be dinner and became only a ritual, a set of forms and ways established. To complete the betrayal of the liberal act of Jesus, when Christianity was just beginning to be a “fashion,” someone wrote down the ritual and called it a “mass.” In the end, the result was something that doesn't even remotely resemble a reproduction of what happened that Thursday night.

## Is a more authentic Eucharist possible?

Jesus always spoke in spiritual terms. His teaching was not a teaching for a time or a generation. It was for all times of all times. His words still keep an intact and perennial flavor today. Jesus, at the last supper, wanted his apostles to understand a very important thing: _That he never abandons us. He is, installed in the heart of every human being, “of every human being”, of any belief, race or nation, to illuminate Truth and Righteousness_. And this reality of the Spirit of Jesus in the human heart is like a food that makes those who are guided by it towards eternal life grow. The Last Supper was not held in a majestic building. It was not in any temple, nor in any sacred place. There were no holy garments, nor was it officiated by anyone. Jesus was like one more among them. He calls them “his friends” and invites them not to seek to be served, but to serve. There is no gold or precious stones in the Last Supper. There is a meal among friends, celebrated in an ordinary house, in the context of a dinner. There are some symbolic elements that express a greater reality, which is the divine presence of Jesus and the Father in the heart of every believing man. There is a liberality in the way of doing things. It is a meeting to talk about the spirit. Each one intervenes when he wants, asks, speaks, listens. There is no ceremonialism in the act of Jesus. He does not say that bread and wine should be used, but that bread and wine, like any other food, or anything else, was a symbol of true spiritual food.

He does not say that bread and wine should be used, but that bread and wine, like any other food, or anything else, was a symbol of true spiritual food.

How long will we continue like this? 

What did Jesus want us to learn? He wanted us to forget the forms, the manners, the rites, the ceremonies, the traditions, the customs, the festivities... 

He wanted us to do things the best way we liked to do them. He did not want to pigeonhole or box ideas. They were just symbols! He wanted each one, freely, in a celebration among friends, to eat some food, or anything else, and meaning spiritual food, to have a meal to remember him. Very few today do this. Determined to fix things, as soon as some religious groups take the initiative to deviate from orthodox rigidity, they too fall into the same rigidity and commit the same mistake of ceremonialism.

Jesus wanted FREEDOM, FREEDOM TO EXPRESS IN AN INDIVIDUAL AND PERSONAL WAY THE MAN'S EXPERIENCE OF THE ENCOUNTER WITH HIS HEAVENLY FATHER. Individual because the religious experience is for Jesus a question of each man and woman. And because for him, everyone has to seek his expression through tireless search. There is no meaning greater than another. The greatest thing we can do with rituals is knowing how to be open to all of them. Because there is none that others cannot take advantage of.

Hardly the Christian church today will admit these conclusions. But one day it will come when determined men and women will embark on the adventure of being able to carry out unestablished rites, with meanings drawn from intimate and personal experience. _Someday faithful friends will meet at homes, or in places, or in the same temples, and freely, they will celebrate, without imposing an established model, a dinner to remember, talking among themselves, the greatest of men who has existed on the face of the earth_. 

# Why did Jesus die on the cross? 

## The will of the Father

When Jesus prays at the Getsemaní farm the night he is arrested, he knows perfectly well everything that is being conspired against him. At any moment, Jesus could have avoided that danger by fleeing that night from the city, or by taking refuge in a safe place.

The fact is that Jesus had long known that his way of preaching and the open enmity of the main Jewish leaders was putting him in constant danger. On many occasions they tried to arrest Jesus, without success. If Jesus had not fled on these occasions, he would undoubtedly have had a very similar process and trial and an attempt would have been made to execute him without delay. In fact, the usual form of execution for Jews in those days, stoning, was carried out unceremoniously for issues such as adultery or heresy. Crucifixion was a Roman execution reserved as an exemplary mockery against those captured in rebellion or war. It was not a pleasant execution and was never performed on Roman citizens. The Jewish laws were in force throughout Palestine, and laws adjudicating death penalty cases were enforced daily in many Jewish cities. Although Rome was the highest authority in all matters, her pacification policy included the possibility that the conquered peoples maintain a certain independence with respect to the application of judicial or religious laws, except when the case required Roman intervention.

Jesus died crucified like many men and women of his time, but it happened that way only because of a set of circumstances that led to this type of execution. The Jewish leaders did not want a Jewish trial and death for Jesus: they wanted to ingratiate themselves with Rome and obtain a Roman trial and execution. They could think of entangling the Roman governor in these internal religious intrigues because the current procurator, Pontius Pilate, was a violent man of extreme cowardice when he was hard pressed. On several occasions Pontius had had to yield to pressure from the Jewish leaders.

The Jewish leaders, with Caiaphas at their head, knew that the people held the Master in a certain esteem. That is why they were looking for a non-Jewish trial as a way to make the crowd understand that Jesus really was a troublemaker who deserved death, as the Romans had certified. 

Given all this accumulation of circumstances, things were getting worse and worse for Jesus. Were it not for his timely withdrawal in various circumstances, and his refuge for some periods of time in friendly territory, as was the case with the tetrarchy of Herod Philippi, surely today we would not be speaking of crucifixion but of stoning. . In fact, the first martyr disciples were all stoned to death.

Jesus was well aware of all this macabre scenario. He knew that his life was going to consist of a continuous distance and safety. The gates of Jerusalem were closed to him, under pain of imprisonment. On his last visit to Jerusalem they did not arrest him only because the Temple guard in charge of leading him before the Sanhedrin, hearing him say he was preaching in the Court of the Gentiles, changed his mind. That guardian earned his expulsion from the Sanctuary, so Jesus had fewer and fewer resources left to get them to let him preach in peace.

Jesus knew that his message would triumph in foreign lands, that his preaching would have a better acceptance in Greece, or Egypt, or Syria. But Jesus was a Jew to the core, he deeply loved his people and his homeland. And he chose Palestine as his only base of operations because he only wanted to win the difficult part of the experience: preach and bring the good news to the most difficult people of all, the people who considered themselves “the chosen one”. . Jesus knew in advance that the undertaking was practically impossible, with all the paraphernalia of legal provisions and religious rigidity that flooded the nation with him. But that was and is apparently the mission of a being like Jesus: impossible missions that can only be understood with the perspective of thousands of years.

Jesus knew that sooner or later, if he continued to preach in his land, they would finish him off. He knew that his safety and the possibility of preaching were almost nil in such a rarefied environment. He could use his divine power and his foresight of events as a creator, but he chose to live a human life, with all the limitations and all the consequences that this could bring. We have said that he foresaw or was even certain of his arrest, but in all these cases Jesus was faithful to the promise he made to himself and lived like any other man. He had no more knowledge of the future than a normal person. He knew he was going to be caught as any man with any insight could see.

Faced with this circumstance, Jesus made a decision: he was not going to flee permanently. The time would come when he would ignore that shadow that stalked him and bravely stand before his captors, mindlessly doing the daily life of preaching that he had always been doing. Surely that would mean his capture and his death. And Jesus, knowing the humiliation and humiliation that this death was going to entail, did not back down at any time. His firm decision was to end his days as any other insidious teacher or preacher would have ended had he not fled: captured and killed.

There is no connection between the ignominious death of Jesus and the will of the Father. The Heavenly Father did not require such an end of Jesus. The truth is that he was the other way around. The Father asked Jesus to live a human life to the end so that our Creator would have the full experience and knowledge of what it means to live as a limited mortal. The Father would have been overjoyed if Jesus had been able to complete his days on earth as an old man, and he would have died heavy old. But unfortunately, the political and religious circumstances of the time made it practically impossible for a man determined not to fall back and flee to preach in peace to the people without being disturbed. Jesus decided to end up crucified on a cross instead of being killed one night in the camp, or robbed by some assassins of the Sanhedrin, or stoned in some Palestinian village. He preferred a notorious death, in full view of everyone, because he wanted to convey to his followers the greatest teaching of all: “death is not the end of anything, but the beginning of everything.”

Unfortunately, the subsequent Christian church has distorted this event with theories, embarking on a strange story of atonement for sins that was never part of the message of Jesus. Later Christians almost turned the wonderful loving Father of the “parable of the prodigal son” into a just and cruel Lord who was only concerned that his beloved Son suffer to atone for a sin committed by humanity.

The theory of the degradation of humanity due to an original sin of our first parents, and the remission of that sin thanks to a bloody sacrifice of the Creator Son is a mythological theory that would be very much to the liking of those early Christians, but which is surprising. for its full validity in the Christian churches two thousand years later. The most open and reflective minds of our time are beginning to wake up and realize that erroneous and meaningless beliefs cannot continue to be held simply because they come from a distant past. This conservatism in beliefs is undermining these Christian institutions as authentic guarantors of religious wisdom.

For Jesus _the Heavenly Father is the most loving Being that exists in the universe_. His love for us reaches such an extent that he is always waiting for us. The Father has never recorded as faults those committed by our parents, nor any other fault. Because the Father is not a righteous Being who spends the day writing down the faults committed by his children and then asking them to account. Neither he nor he has designed a cruel and horrendous punishment for those who have lived a life of sin.

Hell, sin, judgment... These concepts are not part of the mentality of the Father, but of the mentality of men. The only hell that awaits the wicked is a world where the only possible currency is love. The only sin is knowing the truth and still rejecting it. And the judgment that the Father has reserved for us is actually a new beginning in which we will not be condemned but to start a new and better life.

The Father does not want even one of us to be lost. And he does not stop offering us opportunities, as many as necessary, so that we all discover our terrible mistakes and return home, like the prodigal son. His love is something incomprehensible to us, used to terms like justice or punishment. The infinite wisdom of the Father, however, goes far beyond our clumsy concepts. The Father knows that the best way to attract his children to love is with a love without limits. And when all the men who have committed evil in this world pass into the next world and see with what love everything in the universe is planned, conversion to the path of truth is practically immediate. Men and women, _when they pass to the other side_, find the spiritual reality of creation:

The Father never asked Jesus to perform such a cruel sacrifice. The Father is not such a just and implacable Being that the Christians of the initial times drew us. In the portrait that Jesus made there was only kindness and understanding towards his wayward children.

The Christian churches should seriously rethink many of their postulates maintained to this day. Of course that _the theory of the expiation of sin by a sacrifice of Jesus on the cross is totally false_ and nothing more contrary to the true character and personality of the authentic message of Jesus. These theories should be rejected out of hand as errors of the past that have persisted only because of that excess of conservatism that has religious institutions in their grip. The churches fear that if they begin to rethink theories, believers and non-believers will begin to relativize their guarantee of possession of the truth. “If it turns out that we have spent centuries believing something false, what can we trust now?” They think. That is why they continue to maintain at all costs those beliefs in their books and creeds, despite how incongruous they seem to many. Only from time to time a revolution breaks out and in that schism of ideas in the end what happens is that new minor Christian churches are created. But hardly anything changes.

The origin and explanation of this theory is in the apostle Paul, who infused Mithraist ideas into the message of Jesus. In a graffito preserved in a Mithraeum on the Aventine (ca. 200. AD) one can read the words pronounced by a Mithraist priest during a ceremony in honor of the god Mithras: “You saved men with the shedding of eternal blood.” The legends about Mithras, moreover, are full of sacrificial acts where Mithras kills a bull whose blood allows hundreds of new lives to be created. In fact, even the most important ceremony in Mithraism was a banquet where believers (mistas) ate bread and wine. Taking into account that Mithraism is a religion of Persian origin that was widespread when Jesus began to preach,

The message of Jesus about the loving personality of the Father was vilely betrayed during all these years by a stupid theory about a righteous god who only forgave a fault of humanity when he saw the humiliation and cruel sacrifice to which his Son underwent. Jesus never preached such idiocies more characteristic of the generations of the first Christians than of the current ones. But what is striking is that they have not been rejected or forgotten in our days, and supplanted by a more loving and uplifting message, which is the one that all humanity longs for. 

## The relationship between the death of Jesus and Easter

_There is no connection between the death of Jesus and the Jewish Passover_. The Jewish Passover was a celebration that involved the sacrifice of hundreds of animals, which was a common practice in the time of Jesus. But this celebration was created and elaborated by men. The Heavenly Father, as Jesus taught us, has never claimed such bloody demonstrations from his children. Mankind never gained more or less favor from the Father by performing these sacrificial acts. The Father loves each and every one of his children equally with an immovable love from time to time. The Father's love is absolutely certain and never required human participation because it is part of the essence and personality of the Father. Jesus dismantled all these ideas from the heads of his followers (“I want mercy and not sacrifices”, he told them) and from the first moment of his preaching he already declared his intention to completely abolish such practices. Two hundred years later, nothing remained of these practices in the countries that were considered more developed. And those customs, if found anywhere in the world today, are abhorrent to us.

Considering that the idea of ​​sacrifice is a human invention, and that nothing like it exists and never has in the nature of the Father, it is even more surprising and incongruous that the immediate followers of Jesus (and those who followed them until our days) have done nothing but perpetuate this erroneous concept by transmitting it to the death of Jesus.

Jesus did not die on a cross to pay off an ancient debt of mankind to the Father. There was no motivation in the death on the cross. It was one of the tragic endings that could result from the activity displayed by the Master. It happened on the same day that the sacrificial lambs were slain in the Temple of Jerusalem. But the same thing happened that day that might have happened on any other. Jesus did not want to become a new Passover lamb on which to place the blame of the nation as the Jews of his time did. His purpose in coming to Earth was only one: to reveal the Father to humanity. And his revelation was that the Father is unconditional love. There is nothing in the Father's nature that resembles debt, sacrifice, immolation, or the like. There is only mercy, infinite patience,

The theory that the death of Jesus waged an ancient battle against evil that prevented the resurrection of the dead is absolutely false. The system that the heavenly authorities use to revive us in the future world has nothing to do with the fact of Jesus' death on the cross. In any case, it has more to do with the extraordinary fact of the sending of the helping spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Truth. The passage from this world to the next world, as Jesus also taught his followers, is carried out by various systems that sometimes involve the passage of many years for each resurrected mortal. But this transit is absolutely guaranteed for each and every one of us and for all those who preceded us. That the system of resurrection to new life has a delay does not mean that the Father has shown respect of persons. Sometimes, at certain times, a certain time was necessary before several generations could pass to the worlds that await us after death. What changed in this scenario with the arrival of the Spirit of Truth is that from that day on every person who dies immediately enters the next world without having to wait a long period of time for a generational resurrection.

These ideas are complex even for our days, and when Jesus preached and taught about them in his day, they soon ended up as legends or minor stories that lost interest. The idea that Jesus, with his death on the cross and his bloody sacrifice, had managed to defeat the evil that prevented us from accessing the resurrection, however, spread throughout the Christian community, and has still reached to the present day. However, Jesus never preached these false ideas, which turn the wonderful plan of the Father into a kind of judicial sequel between a Father and his Son. _The resurrection to new life is a fact guaranteed to all mankind by birth_. There has never been a man or woman who has not been resurrected in the new world. And this world is a world of love and understanding, far superior to the best civilization we could imagine for Earth. Each and every one of our mortal brothers who died have passed through this place and gone to that place without distinction, whether they were wicked or good in this world. And in that world of unimaginable goodness and perfection is where we all learn and will learn that the only thing that governs the destinies of the universe is a plan based on love for others and concern for their well-being.

Jesus did not fight any battle against evil because He is the Creator Being of a part of a universe where only good exists. And he did not have to win a special status for us before the Father because since the beginning of time the continuation of life after death has been a guaranteed fact for all humanity without distinction. The Father has loved humanity and loves it both before the coming of Jesus and after. His unconditional and unlimited love has never changed, and none of the supposed celebrations of men has meant a change in a love that was eternal and infinite forever. Even if Jesus had not come to Earth, the resurrection was guaranteed and the Father's love absolutely certain.

The death of Jesus was a tragic and sad event, which should never have happened. But this is often the case on worlds where civilizations are still at a certain stage of virulence. Man can become excessively destructive, but all these times are distant shadows of the past in worlds more dominated by love and understanding. If Jesus had made his visit at a different time, with a more advanced civilization, surely He would have been enjoyed for many more years and His message would have been more fully understood. But the fact of his tragic death should not condition us to strange theories. It is preferable to learn more from the life of Jesus than from his incomprehensible death. The motivations of Jesus were very complex and diverse,


## The meaning of death on the cross 

Christians of all ages have carried the importance of the physical fact of Jesus' death to extremes. This event has impacted their minds so much that since then they have not stopped annually celebrating a week-long reminder of the Master's agony and suffering (Holy Week). All the artistic and cultural elements have been put at the service of these heartfelt moments (sculptures, processions of the faithful, the sounds of drums, an inner feeling of deep regret...).

However, it has been lost sight of that Jesus lived for thirty-six years on a cross fraught with conflict and difficulty. And that all those years, in the perspective of time, were like a gift, a gift for all generations and times and for all beings that inhabit this universe. Although there was by no means any debt to settle or racial guilt to atone for by dying on a cross, it is true that Jesus lived an entire life of service through the living example that He set for the intelligences and beings created by Him.

We must have the perspective that we barely know Jesus. The written gospels only collect some of the anecdotes that surrounded a period of public preaching that Jesus led in about three to four years. Knowing as the Christian community knows that Jesus must have lived for about thirty-six years, what happened during the remaining thirty-odd years? Did the carpenter from Nazareth live in his town with absolutely nothing of note happening during all those years?

Only small portions of a story have come down to us, but if we could contemplate the whole life of Jesus in perspective, his childhood, his adolescence, his difficult youth, the independence of the home, his travels through his country, abroad... we would realize that his whole life was aimed at offering an extraordinary example of dedication to teaching and revelation. Jesus was a teacher from his earliest youth. That mastery came, of course, from a source that was not merely human. But Jesus unfolded his life as one more man, exemplifying for all groups of beings in the universe (including angels of the most diverse natures and other beings) how a being dedicated to showing others the way should behave.

What we don't realize is that Jesus did not come to earth to reveal the way and the truth _only_ to human beings, but also to angels and all heavenly agencies. _The true meaning of the cross is service to others without limitations_. Jesus chose to live a life of unlimited service. He offered all beings of will in the universe an example of what it means to help others by showing them a better way, regardless of the environment we face or the conditions in which we have to carry out that assignment. This example is an example for all of us, but especially for groups of angels, beings who are born with full awareness of themselves but who gain vital experience through assistance to beings like us,

Jesus spoke much and repeatedly to his disciples about these groups of beings. However, the teachings about the existence of angels and other beings, and their modes of existence and relationship with us in the universe, are too advanced to be understood even today. All these stories about angels and celestial entities today sound like little more than stories for little children, lost myths unbecoming of the domesticated and technocratized world of the twenty-first century. However, those beings exist. They are not what we imagine them to be and it is absolutely unlikely that we will ever see one in this life. But they are there, in that non-material world that awaits us after death, ready to help us on our long pilgrimage path towards the truth,

For all these beings, the death of Jesus for thirty-six years on the cross of human experience is a stimulating and inspiring example of how they should exercise their activity with us, and how they should collaborate with each other. On untold millions of inhabited worlds and angelic spheres, billions upon billions of creatures, human beings or angels, who might have been tempted to give up the moral fight and the hard struggle of faith, have seen Jesus speaking with the Mithraic leaders of Rome or forgiving their executioners on the cross, and since then they have proceeded forward with renewed courage, inspired by the sight of a God who devotedly offers his life of Incarnation as an altruistic service to men and powers.

_The death of Jesus on the cross was not to reconcile man with God but to stimulate man to understand the eternal love of the Father and the endless mercy of his Son, and to spread these universal truths to an entire creation_. 


## Conclusions 

The theory of the expiation of original sin by the sacrificial death of Jesus on the cross is absolutely false and also contrary to the Master's message. The Father has never imputed to humanity the faults committed by his ancestors or any other fault. 

Jesus died on a cross due to a set of political and cultural circumstances of his day, and he did not seek that kind of ignominious death. It was the leaders of his time and the serious lack of justice of the Roman government that triggered this execution.

The reasons why Jesus did not choose to go to safety and gave himself up to be killed, as he knew, are very complex and incomprehensible to us. We should focus our attention more on his inspiring life and his message than on this final act of his days.

Jesus did not die to earn us a right to life that had been closed to us because of the lack of the first parents. The resurrection from the dead into new life is a fact that is guaranteed for all men and women of all times and generations and of all races, creeds and nationalities. Even, due to the infinite goodness and mercy of the Father, it is guaranteed for those who have lived a licentious life full of evil. Divine justice is much more effective than human justice and takes into account that unlimited trust and forgiveness is the only way to attract misguided beings towards love.

Jesus lived a life not only for the inspiration and encouragement of humanity but also of the ignored angelic agencies. For these agencies, which often carry out a work of stimulating man towards the knowledge of the truth in difficult conditions, seeing his Creator being subjected to the worst conditions in which the truth could be disseminated has been an invaluable source of inspiration. 

# Was Jesus Risen? Will we resurrect? 


Traditionally it has been considered that the resurrection of Jesus was a return to life in the same carnal state that he had before he died, even that he retained the marks of his wounds. The evangelist John tells in 20 27: «Approach your finger and check my hands; reach out your hand and put it in my side. And do not be unbelieving, but believer».

These statements seem to be referring to the crucifixion wounds, traces of which must have remained on his body. However, personally, I am not satisfied with this idea of ​​the resurrection. This idea establishes it as a physical fact, a new return to life in a new physical body, here on Earth. This is the idea of ​​the Christian churches from the beginning. In the same way that Jesus had risen, believers would also rise, in the near end of time, and those who had led a worthy life would be saved from death and would return to life in a new physical body. The Catechism of the Catholic Church says:

«1038 The resurrection of all the dead, “of the just and of sinners” (Acts 24, 15), will precede the Final Judgment. This will be “the hour when all who are in the graves will hear his voice and those who have done good will be raised to life, and those who have done evil will be condemned” (Jn 5:28-29). Then, Christ will come “in his glory accompanied by all his angels,... All nations will be gathered before him, and he will separate them one from another, as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. He will put the sheep to his right hand, and the goats on his left... And these will go to eternal punishment, and the righteous to eternal life.” (Mt 25:31,32,46).»

However, this catechism transcribes texts from the Acts of the Apostles and the Gospel of Matthew that are actually based on a Jewish idea of ​​the resurrection, an idea that sought, above all, human justice. According to this idea, of course, among “the assembled nations”, the one that would be ahead of all would be the Jewish. In other words, for the Jews the resurrection is a matter of justice, the day on which the Lord would come to teach the wicked (the pagans) his lesson and would revive the good ones (the Jewish people and the Jewish proselytes) forever. The Christians later perpetuated this idea by transferring it from the Jewish people to the Christian people.

What happens then with all those inhabitants of our planet who have not even had a notion of the existence of Jesus? What happens to all those who, by tradition and custom inherited from their parents, follow the beliefs of other religions? 

Christianity has dealt with this question in a very timid way. They cannot openly admit that it does not matter what religion they profess to save themselves in that salvation they believe, because then, what is the point of giving so much importance to religion? On the other hand, they cannot openly say that the only religion that leads to salvation is Christianity, because then this intolerance would lead to alienation and rejection by the many peoples of the Earth who do not profess Christianity.

I ask this question: what is more feasible: that, as Christianity says, the resurrection is a question of reward or punishment that is resolved by examining the life of a person, or rather that our Father, in his infinite mercy and love, does not respect persons and RESURRECT EVERYONE, EVERYONE EQUALLY, JUST DIE?

For many, the second option is not conceivable and horrifies their principles because they value the resurrection from the perspective of human justice. How can God be so unwise as to let those who have been wicked live? Will He not apply justice to them and make them see their wickedness and condemn them to punishment and make them suffer? I do not agree. Is it that the justice of God can be compared with the human? This justice, it is almost worse than human! Today, a man who commits a terrible crime can spend between twenty and thirty years in prison, where he could reform and become a man aware of his mistake and willing to lead a good life. He would be released under caution and he could end his days reintegrated into society. Does this happen in our justice, and will it not happen in the divine?

What will happen to those who lived a life of evil because they were educated that way from childhood, those who actually suffered a handicap because of the environment in which they grew up? What will happen to children under five years of age, children who have not even fully developed their consciousness? Doesn't God have for these children a place like Earth where they can grow and develop into adults, a place that compensates for the deficiencies of this world? Is this not justice?

I cannot believe in a God whose justice is less than human, because this seems to me suspicious proof that they were written about this God by human hands, and that those who wrote these things believed in another God, a primitive God who did not It agrees with the idea that Jesus transmits of Him.

I can't believe that life after death in a better place (heaven) is a prize for those who have led a good life. So many Christians think, but I have a more encouraging view: the resurrection from the dead is an undeniable fact for all mankind. This is the novel proclamation of Jesus: All human beings who have gone before us have enjoyed this fact whether they were good or evil in this world. There is a better life after physical death for all human beings without distinction. This teaching was openly proclaimed by Jesus on numerous occasions, although he did not give extensive information about what we will find when we die and how we will live afterwards.

This resurrection, therefore, is not the prize of a chosen few who have managed to live a life along the path of good (Christians say that this path passes fundamentally through being a good Christian, although they weakly open the door to other good people of other denominations). The resurrection is, rather, a gift. All human beings enjoy this gift. The Father has a much more loving and generous plan than human cruelty can conceive. Are there not many beings who do evil due to hindrances in their mind or character? Don't society and the environment influence many evildoers?

If I believe in a loving God to the extreme, I can only believe in a God with an exceptional plan so that all that evil committed is destined to be repaired, if not in this life, then in the next. This plan of God is THE SALVATION OF ALL HUMAN BEINGS. He does not want EVEN ONE of us to be lost. He once again gives men and women opportunities to reconsider and make up for lost time. 

Someone will think: «Well, yes, but there is a limit to what is acceptable. What about those criminals of overwhelming evil, the genocides, the bloodthirsty, the terrorists that history has had? There are kings and rulers who murdered thousands and thousands of innocents. There can be no second chance for them."

Jesus said, “Not just one chance, but seventy times seven chances.” And furthermore, in worlds with far fewer obstacles than ours. But, how can we put limits on the love of God because we are not capable of loving in such a way or because we do not understand that the only way to attract a fellow man towards good is with good? Why are there no shackles or torture in today's prisons (or at least not in the prisons of countries that have evolved)? Why do we think that we do not achieve anything by making the offender suffer with punishment, that in this way we do not bring him back to society? If our justice already contemplates the possibility of repentance, why shouldn't our Father's?

The evil of the world is very painful for us. There is immeasurable death and suffering. But this should not blind us. Our view of the reality of the universe is very limited. The Father lives in a dimension, and with a love, that surpasses us in everything we can imagine. So why not look at all this pain from a new perspective? Why not think that all this pain will be compensated, for EVERYONE, as soon as they die, with a new life, with many new lives, even? 

## The Empty Tomb

The empty tomb was an indisputable reality. In fact, never in history has there been a tomb with bones containing the remains of Jesus. The enemies of Jesus said that it was a theft of the body. But the Christians mistakenly identified the fact of the empty tomb with the fact of the resurrection of Jesus. As the Urantia Book describes, the disappearance of Jesus' body in the tomb and his resurrection are isolated and unconnected events that unfortunately occurred almost simultaneously in time, which produced a whole set of events. of erroneous speculation. This idea is what is revealed in the story of “Despair and Glory.”

During the account of the events that took place on Saturday night in the garden of Joseph of Arimathea, it may have gone unnoticed by the reader that two strange events took place that caught the attention of the guard (See «Strange events in the tomb of Joseph »). The first of these occurred around three in the morning. It was a faint tremor, like a vibration that for a few seconds filled everything in the orchard, and disappeared. The Jewish and Roman guards who guarded the sepulcher clearly perceived this tremor and looked around, puzzled. But when nothing more was heard, they did not give it importance.

Barely ten minutes later, another event occurred that was much more notorious than the first, and that caused his panic and flight. First the animals, as if foreshadowing something, began to make noise, and then the round stone that covered the tomb rolled moved by an apparently invisible force, and a luminous flash was fired, without making a sound, blinding the stunned sentinels for a few seconds. They ran out of there. 

These two events triggered a unique result: the empty tomb, but they require a pertinent explanation that details and clarifies what happened behind it.

Something that is obvious is that physical resurrection is impossible, unless that event occurs within a few days, at most, after death. In a few days, the physical body begins a natural process of decomposition and putrefaction that reduces the entire organism to dust and organic material, which is reintegrated into the biological cycles of nature. Therefore, all the molecular components of our physical organism end up dispersed throughout the natural order, later forming part of humus, plants, and other organisms. How then could it be that the resurrection was a physical matter? In any case, we could think of a physical recreation, a reconstitution of our body from nothing. But still, it makes no sense. revive here, again? For what purpose? If we can no longer do anything to be better or worse, if our judgment is already decided and there is only one eternal life of salvation or damnation... Saved forever or damned forever, with no possibility of change. A life where the human being does not evolve, does not progress, simply lives in a state of eternal bliss or suffering. This just scares me.

We habitually say that we feel that we are something more than merely a body. That we have something else, something some call a “soul,” a kind of non-material entity that would survive physical death. Why not think, therefore, that the resurrection is a merely spiritual matter, and not a material one? That what really survives death is a counterpart of us of another nature, not physical, a kind of “double” of us made of another matter inaccessible from the physical world. 

According to this hypothesis, the resurrection would be a change, the abandonment of our material body and the taking possession of a “new body”, constituted by a matter inaccessible to science, the spiritual matter.

If this were so, what relationship would there be between the fact of the empty tomb and the resurrection of Jesus? If a tomb with the remains of Jesus were found today, would it be correct to say that this proves that his resurrection was a falsehood? Why? Are we not saying that the resurrection forgets our old carnal body and takes place in a new immaterial, spiritual form? 

In my opinion, the body of Jesus could have remained in the tomb, and that would not have diminished the fact of his resurrection. 

The explanation of the story is as follows:

At three in the morning, what the sentinels of the sepulcher felt was the tremor caused by the spiritual resurrection of Jesus. This tremor, caused by forces unknown to science, was due to the fact that Jesus, who was not spiritually dead[^1], but only physically, took possession of his new spiritual body, a body similar to the one that awaits us all behind of death. It was this body that the disciples saw on several occasions, but because Jesus made the body visible, because in its normal state it was invisible to human eyes. (That is why we speak of “the appearances of Jesus”, and not of “encounters with Jesus”).

What happened after about ten minutes was totally foreign even to Jesus himself. As The Urantia Book tells, what happened next was a process of volatilization of the physical body of Jesus carried out by a group of angels. This act was carried out with the consent of Jesus, and had a double intention: on the one hand, these angels intended to prevent Jesus' body from becoming an object of devotion for future Christians; on the other hand, they wanted to avoid the sadness of having to contemplate the process of degradation of the body that his Master had on Earth. They received the approval to carry out the disappearance of the body, and respectfully, and using the collaboration of various groups of angels, they carried out the task.

For this it was necessary to open the tomb. The components that constituted the body of Jesus were physical, like those of any of us. Therefore, to extract them from the interior, it was necessary, even if it was only a crack, the opening of the door. A group of angels capable of interacting with physical matter, called “intermediate beings” in The Urantia Book (since they straddle the spiritual world and the material world), were in charge of making the stone wheel at the door turn. moved. Then another group of angels took charge of the dematerialization of the body. According to The Urantia Book, the angels studied various systems and ultimately settled on a process of speeding up time. Apparently, it is possible for these beings to speed up natural processes by reducing the time needed for a physical result to occur, as was the case with putrefaction. This process, which should have taken several years, was reduced to a few seconds. In this process of the angels, something must have happened with the sheets that covered Jesus, because an imprint of the parts of Jesus' body in closest contact with the linen fibers was left on them. This gave rise to what is known worldwide as the “Shroud of Turin”, a relic, which, despite the large number of false objects that are venerated today, is really authentic, as we will see later. This process, carried out with techniques totally unknown by current science, caused a radiation, partly luminous, that came out of the tomb, momentarily blinding the sentinels closest to the cave entrance. And it was this set of astonishing circumstances, mixed with the ideas that were circulating about Jesus as “raiser of the dead”, that caused the panic that sent the Jewish and Roman guards fleeing.

Therefore, this second amazing event witnessed by some Jews and Romans was not actually the resurrection itself. In fact, Jesus did not need the resurrection. He is the being that creates life in a part of the galaxy. Nothing and no one can take away the power of life. However, he chose to continue his existence in the same way that all humans do when we die. He waited a few days (so that it would be more evident to everyone that he had risen), took possession of a spiritual body identical in its constitution to the one we will all have after we die, and made this body visible to some close ones. But this possession of the spiritual body, which is really what we might call the resurrection, occurred almost imperceptibly. And I have tried to imagine this happening, following the author Juan José Benítez in his book «Trojan Horse», as a slight tremor that was perceived in the vicinity of the tomb. If the body of Jesus had remained in the cave, apparently nothing unusual would have happened. His physical body would continue to decompose, but his true self would now reside in a new spiritual body. In addition, if this circumstance had occurred, the appearances of Jesus would have caused an even greater astonishment. How could it be that Jesus appeared to his disciples while his body lay in the tomb? but his authentic being would now reside in a new spiritual body. In addition, if this circumstance had occurred, the appearances of Jesus would have caused an even greater astonishment. How could it be that Jesus appeared to his disciples while his body lay in the tomb? but his authentic being would now reside in a new spiritual body. In addition, if this circumstance had occurred, the appearances of Jesus would have caused an even greater astonishment. How could it be that Jesus appeared to his disciples while his body lay in the tomb?

The fact that the body had evaporated from the tomb was associated as an explanation for the apparitions. Jesus appeared with his own material body and was physically resurrected. However, his body was not physical, although the early Christians claimed it and the evangelists hinted at it in their stories. 

Jesus had no wound marks on his skin because his physical body had been dissolved in the same way that it will happen to all of us. And his new spiritual body, made of a material unimaginable to science, no longer had any relationship or mark of his wounds or suffering. His appearance in that body was so subtly different that many of his disciples who had met him in person did not recognize him at first.

The body that was made present to the disciples and that they were able to recognize (although sometimes in a difficult way, as can be seen from the Gospel account in Mk 16:12 [^2]) was of a spiritual nature and Jesus managed to make it visible to the human eyes even though normally this cannot be so. This explains the way in which Jesus' encounter with his disciples has been described. People normally speak of the “appearances of Jesus.” But nobody falls into the account of the detail. Appearances? So, if Jesus appeared to the disciples (and, logically, he disappeared), how is it that his body was material? Is it not more logical to think that it was of a nature whose natural state is invisible to our eyes, a “spiritual state”?

We do not have any scientific proof of the existence of life after death. Nor that, if there is, it occurs as explained here. We appeal directly to the ground of faith. Is it possible that there is a continuation of life after death? Is Jesus really that extraordinary being, a Creator Being, and did he perform the miracle of appearing to his followers to offer them palpable proof that this life after death is a reality? 

But perhaps there is a loophole, a possibility of scientific proof. And that proof came from the hands of science itself. Without knowing it, the scientists began to examine a revered relic and went from indifference to absolute bewilderment. 

## Grades

[^1]: I want to assume that with Jesus a somewhat different case occurred than that of a normal human being, due to his divinity. We are “rescued from death.” Jesus is “the life.” Although Jesus died on a cross, the man Jesus died, but the divine Jesus continued his existence. 

[^2]: “After this he appeared, with a different appearance, to two of them who were on their way to the field.” Why did Jesus' appearance seem different to you? Because he no longer had the same body they had known in life. 

# The Holy Shroud of Turin 


This image formed on the shroud that is currently kept in the city of Turin is the center of hundreds of emotional conflicts, undoubtedly caused by the devotion and rejection that they have provoked in the human intellect.

For many, the sheet is authentic, and they even go further: it is the palpable proof that Jesus was resurrected, leaving an indelible mark on history with his resurrection. 

To others, this sheet is a brilliantly designed fraud, the work of some highly skilled artist. Some speak of Da Vinci as the author. Interestingly, many of these detractors consider the ideas about the resurrection of Jesus to be a successful hoax of the early Christians. 

But this sheet is much more than meets the eye. People hardly know about the amazing discoveries that science has made! This apparent enemy of faith and religion turns out to be the staunchest ally of some discoveries that call into question any doubt about her.

It is convenient to review these discoveries in the order in which they occurred: 

On May 28, 1898, the Turin lawyer Secondo Pia, also appreciated as an amateur photographer, was commissioned to photograph, for the first time in history, the Holy Shroud. He had no idea, neither he nor anyone else, that they were offering him a front-page story. The image, which to the naked eye is barely perceptible to the human eye, appeared totally clear on the photographic negative, showing the face of a punished man and a body full of wounds.

In 1902, Yves Delage, a member of the Académie des Sciences, an anatomist-pathologist who had studied the negatives, stated in a study he read at the Académie that there were conspicuous evidence that the image showed the body of a man who had been punished. similar to the flagellation and crucifixion of Roman times. Naturally, the controversy was served for several months. 

Many years passed before anyone was authorized to examine the object again. On the night of May 3, 1931, at 10:30 p.m., in the Turin cathedral, a second Turin photographer, named Giuseppe Enrie, in an official and controlled process, took a set of new photographs.

The operation was carried out amidst tremendous tensions: many predicted that now, with more advanced technologies, orthochromatic films, yellow filters and public control, the 1898 phenomenon would not be repeated, and Pia's photos would be shown to have been a camera failure. 


But the truth is that the phenomenon was repeated, and this time, the images were of horrifying quality and clarity, showing the bruised and badly wounded body of an extremely mistreated being. The stupor of society began to transform into astonishment.

On the night of November 23, 1973, Max Frei, a great palynologist and renowned Swiss criminologist, and his colleague, Professor Guio, had access to the sheet, obtaining 12 dust samples, on a surface of 240 mm2. For this, he used special hanging ribbons, without touching the areas of the image. In successive studies he was able to identify almost fifty plants, represented by as many types of pollen. Among these, 16 stood out, almost exclusive to the desert and high-salinity regions of the Dead Sea (halophytes). There were also other specimens from the steppes of Anatolia, France and Italy. All this corroborated the existing tradition about the places where the sheet is known to have remained.

Between 1969 and 1976, fragments of reddish material extracted from the sheet were examined at a famous Italian university. The presence of blood could not be confirmed for sure, but neither did the study deny the possibility.

An anomalous property of the sheet image has been known for a long time. As one approaches the canvas, the image fades and a few feet away it ceases to be seen and disappears, leaving only visible the stains of what was later shown to be blood. In 1977, a physicist at the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory named Ray Rogers found that this mysterious property of the sheet is a reproducible scientific fact. The imprint of the sheet is weak, and it does not have a drawn border. A few meters away, the eye perceives the slight differences in color between the imprint and the clean part of the linen, and thus we can establish where the imprint ends and therefore what its profile is. As we get closer, the image extends to the entire retina: the eye no longer manages to highlight the limits between the image and the space that surrounds it. This phenomenon is called “lateral neural inhibition.” This meant showing that the image could not have been formed by a painter or an artist, because he could not have seen the image when painting it. Mystery and curiosity began to dominate studies on the Shroud.

Otterbein, named president of the Holy Shroud Guild, was visited in 1970 by Captain John Jackson, who had read John Walsh's book on the Holy Shroud. Walsh, who was one of those responsible for interpreting photographs sent by satellite to the Moon and Mars, intended to expose the Shroud photos to the same procedure and equipment. The experiment, carried out on one of Giuseppe Enrie's plates, surprised Jackson, who immediately turned to his colleague, Captain Eric Jumper, to consult the result.

Just as three-dimensional (3-D) rendering had revealed the depth of craters and mountains on the Moon, the same team revealed a variation in distance between the mantle and the body that produced the image. Vignon had suspected this in 1902, but Jackson and Jumper tested it on state-of-the-art equipment of the time. 

The experiment attracted many scientists, to the point that Jackson and Jumper petitioned the Holy Shroud Guild to host a scientific conference in Albuquerque, New Mexico, United States, in March 1977. 


The conference convinced most skeptics that the Mantle was, at least, a mysterious object and not a simple drawing or “daguerreotype” as some suggested, which therefore demanded further evidence.

In September 1977, the Holy Shroud Guild brought a group of scientists to Turin, the STURP (Shroud of Turin Research Corporation), to propose a series of tests that were eventually accepted in April 1978, during the 400th anniversary of the Mantle's arrival in Turin. 

On August 26, 1978, the five-week period of public exhibition begins. It is the first major public exhibition since 1933. At the same time as the opening, Cardinal Luciani of Venice is proclaimed Pope, becoming John Paul I.

On September 29, 32 North American scientists of the most diverse specialties and beliefs arrived in Turin with 70 containers of the most sophisticated equipment available and were authorized to examine and photograph the relic from noon on Sunday until 10 pm on Friday: more than 96 hours. .

The day before the STURP studies began, the Pope died suddenly and Carol Wojtila, the future John Paul II, was elected. However, despite several problems with luggage and scientific material, the investigation continues. After many meetings and preparations on the ground, they finally get the scientific equipment. From October 5 to 7, 1978, all members engaged in the costly task of unpacking and preparing the instruments. Finally, on the long-awaited October 8, the Shroud is removed from public display and taken from Guarini's chapel to a private room.

During five frantic days without sleep, the researchers exposed the piece to countless tests. It was photographed with great precision and examined with X-rays and ultraviolet rays. A large number of samples were removed using adhesive tape. For the first time an instrument was introduced between the cloth with the image and the back cloth (the sheet had a sewn cloth that covered the entire back). Nobody had seen in 400 years the image that appeared from behind, and that showed the torso and the back of the crucified. On the night of October 9, the first sample of what would later be confirmed as blood was obtained.

They returned to the United States with so much information that until 1985 the information had to be ordered and reduced. Some articles were written but only in specialized magazines. Researchers always appreciated the fact that the Church authorities in Italy allowed scientific articles to be published freely and without the need for ecclesial review or approval. 

However, STURP decided to send, out of courtesy, a representative to inform Cardinal Ballestero, then Archbishop of Turin. Dr. Larry Schwalbe and Dr. John Jackson, accompanied by Fr. Otterbein, and two Italian members of STURP, Dr. L. Gonella and Dr. G. Riggi, spoke with the Cardinal for an hour and a half to explain the results in non-technical language.

Encouraged by the Cardinal and wishing to keep the surprising result of the conclusions in the circle of the highest scientific credibility, the STURP delegates requested and obtained a special audience with Pope John Paul II, for whom they prepared a special dossier with two photographs revealing. The appointment, set immediately after the general audience of May 13, 1981, could never take place: the members of STURP heard from the audience room the shots that tried to take the life of the Pontiff.

During the months that followed the investigation, a heated controversy arose with Dr. Walter McCrone, who headed the team to whom the possible blood samples had been entrusted. The doctor went so far as to affirm that he had discovered evidence that showed the hand of an artist on the canvas, even though many other tests carried out completely ruled out this possibility.

But the controversy did not last long. On October 10, 1981, at New London's Palmer Auditorium, John Heller explained to the STURP Congress his investigation of a 180-micron fragment of reddish substance. Heller showed the slide and people shivered: they were red blood cells. Blood. It was shown that the image was not an icon. And not only that. Heller showed that under the blood crusts the image had not formed, because the blood had protected the cloth. Therefore, it was not an addition of blood on the image. So how do you add that blood in such an anatomically exact way without first drawing the imprint? The proof that the image was not the painting of an artist was getting closer and closer. But that was not all. Heller showed that he had found a very high amount of bilirubin. Which meant only one thing: the blood was that of a severely and repeatedly traumatized body, in which violent hemolysis occurred. As is known, this hemolysis produces an excess of hemoglobin in the blood which, upon reaching the liver, is loaded with bilirubin. The coincidences were beginning to be too many.

In 1988, Cardinal Ballestero himself authorized the extraction of a single sample, later divided into three, on which he has authorized a Carbon-14 test, with a view to determining its dating. The results opened an unprecedented controversy, with constant appearances in the media: the sheet showed a date from the Middle Ages. Despite the multitude of historical evidence and documents proving its antiquity, this evidence was the torch that revived the detractors' demonstrations. Until today it has not been possible to contrast this test, which again puts the doubt floating on the sheet. 

After this date, the STURP and other organizations have dedicated themselves to promoting new research.

The STURP scientific investigators, most of them non-religious, after their thorough examinations, reached a single conclusion: “We are not able to explain, in scientific terms of our time, how the image could have been formed.”

This circumstance continues today. No scholar of the subject has been able, with a comparable quality, to reproduce, in a similar image, the phenomenon produced in the Turin Shroud. All those who have tried it have had to resort to complex chemical procedures based on exposing a fabric to certain substances or thermal conditions. No one has been able to produce a similar imprint using pictorial methods. And yet, none of these tests has even come close to achieving a result with so many unknowns and surprises.

The question that knocks on our door is this: how can it be that such an old canvas contains an image generated by a procedure that current science is not capable of reproducing? What genius has been able to produce such an imprint that far exceeded everything that our best scientists today are capable of achieving?

The only rational explanation is this: The sheet is not made by human hands. It is the first evidence, palpable and evident, that “someone”, outside the scientific knowledge of an era, produced the first, and perhaps the only object, the result of an artificial process generated by non-human hands. We don't know who that someone was, and we don't know why the object came to be, but the result is clear. The result is not natural, it does not reproduce any natural process; it is unique, there is no equal object on the whole Earth; and it contains an image that today's science is not capable of reproducing in another similar fabric. All directions point to an origin that surpasses man, something above the natural order, and perhaps the proof for all humanity that Jesus really rose,

I sincerely believe that we are facing an object that science, one day, will be able to decipher and tell us the process by which it was obtained. And I believe that then, given the enormity of the discovery, it will reveal to us, to all of humanity, a great open secret: that the image is a silent witness to a great truth: “Jesus is risen.”
