# Unity

*by David Glass*

<!--centered-->
We all shall know the harmony of spirit
Attuning us to inner unity,
A demonstration of our kindred spirit
As children of the same One Deity.
The many variations that divide us
Shall be eclipsed by transcendental love.
The inner spirit's working shall unite us
In oneness both on earth and then above
As rays projected out from one bright Centel
Retracted to divinity shall we
Be drawn unto the Universal Center,
The focus of Eternal Harmony,
The primacy of spirit gives us kinship -
A universal family of friendship.

# The basket

Author: **Charlene Morrow**

<!--centered-->
It happened on the very last Wednesday 
Almost all the bright days were gone 
It was a day of rest, as was their way 
The master walked toward the hills alone   
Guards were offered for him by 
David Knowing that these were times of danger 
But with legions of angels awaiting his bid 
He had no fear of friend or stranger   
He walked away, but in a short time 
Was offered a basket of food for the day 
He reached for the handle ready to climb 
And turned to walk on his solitary way   
John Mark held on to the basket 
Gripping on firmly and strong 
He’d made up his mind to carry it 
If needed for all the day long   
The apostles, they couldn’t believe their eyes 
They were shocked at the temerity of the lad 
Deep in their hearts they could not deny 
They were jealous, lonely, and sad   
Later on Nathaniel spoke to them 
And told them how they could each 
Have had the chance to join him 
If they’d wanted to be there in reach   
Young John held on intently 
The man could only smile 
And look down upon him gently 
Letting him come all the while   
All the boy desired was the pleasure 
Of ministering to his loved one 
The yearning which no heart can measure 
Since he felt as if he were a son   
The two, they had such a good visit 
The conversation, so private was it all 
The master made comment of it 
That to no one a word should fall   
A unique day in time and space 
But not so strange or odd 
If any had wanted so badly could face 
A day alone with God

# Time and time out

Author: **K. Brendi Poppel**

<!--left-->
Time is a measure of material momentum, 
But when time stands still.... 
The universe whispers a song to my soul, 
For an instant my heart is fulfilled. 
Here and there we can taste of eternity, 
In the silent spaces where no time exists, 
Where God speaks in the language of lovers, 
Unlike the manipulations of materialists. 
In the mechanistic mold which we have made, 
Our days are divided into segmented spaces, 
This business prevents the Spirit from penetrating 
The prison we have built to encase us. 

Time out from the tumult of non-stoppable action! 
The never-ending traffic that pollutes our view, 
Time out from the scheduled sequence we follow! 
The essence of eternity can hardly break through ... 
The cacophony we’ve created, the commotion and clatter, 
We sabotage ourselves with meaningless chatter. 

I behold you in love, and then do I see ... 
Time suspended, transcended ... eternity ... 
Where lives intertwine in the cosmic design, 
With each one included in the indelibly divine 
Pattern we perceive, the Masterful Plan, 
Is a blueprint to believe beyond this life span ... 
Time is but the beginning, our entry on earth, 
A passage that presages our spiritual rebirth. 
When we take time, we open the door 
To the Spirit, who is waiting for the call, 
To come into our hearts and transform our lives, 
By opening our eyes to the WONDER OF IT ALL !!!

# An Expression of Cosmic Worship

Since he discovered the book in 1972, David Glass’ poems and articles inspired by the revelation have appeared in many Urantia movement publications. After two years in the Portland, OR area, David recently relocated back to Dallas-Ft.Worth. 

<!--centered-->
Oh, Father of all the inhabited worlds, 
true Godhead of galaxies, star-drifts, and suns, 
we adore your Enormity. Stupendous whirls 
of great nebular arms and vast space-sweeping runs 
of subliminal energies infinitesimal, 
ranging the star-fields, are shining on earths 
far remote from our world, which is experimental 
and finding its place in your cosmos; new births 
of galactic star-clouds taking form in the ethers, 
encircling the cosmic domain’s shining brilliance, 
awaken great wonder in all God-believers 
who take in the vastness and utter resilience 
of all the wide, fanciful, cosmic parameters, 
lit by a myriad space-borne light-emitters. 
<br/>
Radiant glories untold from your heartbeats 
are pulsing throughout all the circuits and lanes 
of the starry dimensions in regular repeats 
of outward-gushed energiesósovereign reigns 
of Omnipotent Power upholding each atom 
and every ultimaton throughout the regions. 
Life permeates all the series of atomic, 
vivified life -forms, now numbering legions, 
and all the assemblage of God-produced creatures, 
observant and growing bright Children of Light, 
sing their anthems of homage to you, whose vast features 
are beamed from your Prior, Pre-manifest Brightness 
of Absolute Oneness, turned Ceaseless Endeavor, 
unending expansion for your and our pleasure.

# Poem by Emily Bronte

<!--left-->
No Coward soul is mine 
No trembler in the world’s storm troubled sphere 
I see Heaven’s glories shine, 
And faith shines equal, arming me from fear  

O God within my breast 
Almighty ever present Deity! 
Life, that in me has rest 
As I, Undying Life, have power in thee!  

Vain are the thousand creeds 
That move men’s hearts, unutterably vain; 
Worthless as withered weeds, 
Or idlest froth amid the boundless main.  

To waken doubt in one 
Holding so fast by thy infinity, 
So Surely anchored on 
The steadfast rock of Immortality  

With wide embracing love 
Thy spirit animates eternal years, 
Pervades and broods above, 
Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears.  

Though earth and moon were gone, 
And suns and universes ceased to be, 
And thou wert left alone.  

There is not room for Death, 
Nor atom that his might could render void; 
Since thou art Being and Breath 
And what thou art may never be destroyed.  

2nd January, 1846  

> The poem, which according to her sister Charlotte, were the last lines Emily Bronte wrote, is untitled.

> There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving! (p. 365)

# Last Mountain In Vancouver

<!--left-->
My dear friend
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did across an open field in Lake Forest
Where the summer grass grows green and thick
And autumn gives birth to Plains of fire
A passageway to the sun
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did through a mountain valley in Snowmass
Where spring breezes skid across the evergreens
And winters play snow White symphonies
A passageway to the stars
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did over the Grand Canyon
Where the sun pierces through fresh skin
And pummels the soul with warmth
A passageway to the sky
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did through a corridor in Vancouver
Where flowers bloom in cascades
And mountains make a cosmos
Sitting, laughing, steeling our vision
A world we would energize
A universe we would capsize
But now I reach and cannot touch you
I listen and cannot hear you
But I Still stand beside you
A misfortune has blunted your heart for some time
And seized your laughter
That echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it Will when we meet again somewhere on this Earth
Where your persistence personified Will reign
And laughter shall echo like wind chimes
You, our passageway to Paradise
And without your light, a mission much darkened
Far away, I reach to kindle your soul
With the flame you placed in mine
And stand on the brink of the universe, waiting.
Praying for you,

# NOT WHAT WE GIVE... BUT WHAT WE SHARE...

The following verses are excerpts from "The Vision of Sir Launfal" by James Russell Lowell. Sir Launfal has returned from the Crusades a beggar, his arrogance broken, and with only a single crust of bread to eat, when a leper begs him for alms.

<!--left-->
And Sir Launfal said, "I behold in thee
An image of him who died on the tree;
Behold, through him, I give to thee!"
He parted in twain his single crust,
He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,
And gave the leper to eat and drink,
As Sir Launfal mused with a downcast face,
A light shone round about the place;
The leper no longer crouched at his side,
But stood before him glorified,
Shining and tall and fair and straight
As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful Gate, —
Himself the Gate whereby men can
Enter the temple of God in Man.
His words were shed softer than leaves from the pine,
And they fell on Sir Launfal as snows on the brine,
That mingle their softness and quiet in one
With the shaggy unrest they float down upon;
And the voice that was calmer than silence said,
"Lo, it is I, be not afraid!
In many climes, without avail,
Thou hast spent thy life for the Holy Grail;
Behold it is here, this cup which thou
Didst fill at the streamlet for me but now;
This crust is my body broken for thee,
This water His blood that died on the tree;
The Holy Supper is kept, indeed,
In whatso we share with another's need;
Not what we give, but what we share, —
For the gift without the giver is bare;
Who gives himsclf with his alms feeds three,
Himself, his hungering neighbor, and me."

# Evening Prayer

Go who makes the angels bright
God who guards the darkest night

I am your child
I need your love
My fears relieve!
My thoughts above make moments tender

Focus my faith so I remember
that as I seek so shall I find

Come, cure the wild and aimless mind

Cast out the doubt of heavenly might
And keep me always in your sight

Forever lead me into light.

# PRAYER FROM ANOTHER WORLD

Glorious Father and Mother, in one parent combined, 
Loyal would we be to your divine nature.
Your own self to live again in and through us 
By the gift and bestowal of your divine spirit, 
Thus reproducing you imperfectly in this sphere
As you are perfectly and majestically shown on high. 
Give us day by day your sweet ministry of brotherhood 
And lead us moment by moment in the pathway of loving service
Be you ever and unfailingly patient with us
Even as we show forth your patience to our children. 
Give us the divine wisdom that does all thing's well 
And the infinite love that is gracious to every creatue. 
Bestow upon us your patience and loving-kindness 
That our charity may enfold the weak of the realm. 
And when our career is finished, make it an honor
to your name, a pleasure to your good spirit, and a 
satisfaction to our soul helpers.

Not as we wish, our loving Father, but as you desire the 
eternal good of your mortal children,

Even so may it be. [144:5.61] (P. 1623)

# Anti-Terror Treatise

<!--center-->
When I shed the suit of worry
That I carry on me day and night,
When I strip away the anxious bands
Of tightly held beliefs,
I stand naked to the gaze of God, and I tremble.

What happens then is nothing short of cosmic love:
Down from the utmost reaches of my mind
Stream consciousness and light in healing waves of wonder.
Enfolded, embraced within supreme creative being,
I am surrounded by the power of righteous thought.
I behold as I am beheld.

What I had clutched to me as vital crumbles into dust.
Selfish hopes are whisked to insignificance
By a force at once benign and beautiful
That powers stars and galaxies,
Yet makes me feel beloved,
At home, encouraged.

The love that forgives, serves. resurrects, remembers,
Showers down on me and on my world of pain and fear.

Our God makes all things newt in spite of our determined doubt.
If I remove rny tiny self, God is there in radiance and mercy.

How can I cling to outmoded ways,
When our world is breaking open before astonished eyes?

# Thy Kingdom Come

O love divine, You arc the seed from which each one of us was born to life. 
Far as the stars, close as our hearts,
You are.....
Your holy Name is uttered everywherc. 
Wake us into full remembrance of Your love. 
Guide us ever to our home, which is with You, that joyous life which you have planned for us through all eternity...
The power and the glory of existence sings within us all: every atom breathes Your breath. 
May we know our holiness as Yours, forevermore. ....
Give us the certainty that all our needs are met through faith in You, whatever be Your Will for us. 
And may it be our Will to Clear the path within that leads to You, to open
every door in welcome and in trust to You, who waits within us, welcoming our remembrance, rejoicing in our love....
Forgive us, and may we bc forgiving toward ourselves, that we forget so often who we are. 
Our own true nature is a godliness; we are of You....
Others, too, who know not fully who they are and play the game of separation in so many ways, may we forgive in full, knowing that their faults are but our own...
Deliver us from all our blindnesses unto the meaning of our lives....
As lights within Your greater light, may we remember You forevcr in the now, in darkness as in day May human love complete your radiance on earth, that we may join with heaven here. Amen

# The Soul’s Expression

With stammering lips and insufficient sound 
I strive and struggle to deliver right
That music of my nature, day and night
With dream and thought and feeling interwound,
And inly answering all the senses round 
With octaves of a mystic depth and height 
Which step out grandly to the infinite 
From the dark edges of the sensual ground. 
This song of soul I struggle to outbear
Through portals of the sense, sublime and whole,
And utter all myself into the air; 
But if I did it, as the thunder roll
Breaks its own cloud, my flesh would perish there, 
Before that dread apocalypse of soul.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning

# Room In My Heart

There is a spacious place inside my heart that waits, 
wanting you to come and stay,
an empty room inside the house I’m sweeping out, 
where you’ll abide forever I pray.

The sunlight shimmers on a stucco wall, 
rippling through the leaves.
It lights a space that meditation seeks, 
a quiet place where shadows play.

Now since you broke my darkness with a golden ray, 
sunlight that came piercing through,
I’ve seen this life was always in such disarray 
true purpose I just never knew.

The dust and cobwebs of confusion too
are being swept away.
And in this house anticipation gleams,
knowing it’s been prepared for you.

# Wonderment and revelation

Wonderment and revelation 
Span the cosmos with their joys, 
And among the hosts of heaven, 
Each his spirit-love employs

Just to win another mortal
To the Father’s timeless plan, 
And to cheer him in his progress 
Toward the bliss awaiting man,

Never can there be an ending; 
Never can adventure halt,
For each level of the journey 
Leads each person to exalt

Everything the Father wishes, 
All the love he would express, 
Giving us the joys of sonship 
And eternal happiness.

How can I withhold my service? 
How can I allow a day
Here to pass without exhorting 
Everyone to find his way

Through the tumult of this planet 
‘Til the time he must depart, 
Soon again in loftier mansions 
To resume? In truth, to start

In that climb that leads him Godward, 
Ne’er again to be a man
On this splendid world of wonder, 
Ne’er to be its dust again.

For each person is an offspring 
Of the Father’s will-to-love,
And he’ll draw his far-flung family 
Home to endless joys above.

# A Reed Singing

I am just a reed..
You will not notice me here.
While still a seed,
I found myself lodged
in a patch of hard earth.
When a trickle of water
discovered my hiding place,
my roots took hold.

More rain fell;
it flowed gloriously
around my pale root and tender sprout.
I clung to this harsh slope,
facing south,
I was given sunshine,
and I grew.

I am just a reed, nothing to you.
Not even one transformed by human hands
into a flute, making music.
But when a marine gale
sweeps across the wind-bitten hill,
blowing between our long stems,
even reeds will sing.

It is then that we praise
the Lord of our creation,
for we seem of small consequence,
yet we have life.
It is precious,
and we give praise.
