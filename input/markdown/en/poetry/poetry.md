# Unity

*by David Glass*

<!--centered-->
We all shall know the harmony of spirit
Attuning us to inner unity,
A demonstration of our kindred spirit
As children of the same One Deity.
The many variations that divide us
Shall be eclipsed by transcendental love.
The inner spirit's working shall unite us
In oneness both on earth and then above
As rays projected out from one bright Centel
Retracted to divinity shall we
Be drawn unto the Universal Center,
The focus of Eternal Harmony,
The primacy of spirit gives us kinship -
A universal family of friendship.

# The basket

Author: **Charlene Morrow**

<!--centered-->
It happened on the very last Wednesday 
Almost all the bright days were gone 
It was a day of rest, as was their way 
The master walked toward the hills alone   
Guards were offered for him by 
David Knowing that these were times of danger 
But with legions of angels awaiting his bid 
He had no fear of friend or stranger   
He walked away, but in a short time 
Was offered a basket of food for the day 
He reached for the handle ready to climb 
And turned to walk on his solitary way   
John Mark held on to the basket 
Gripping on firmly and strong 
He’d made up his mind to carry it 
If needed for all the day long   
The apostles, they couldn’t believe their eyes 
They were shocked at the temerity of the lad 
Deep in their hearts they could not deny 
They were jealous, lonely, and sad   
Later on Nathaniel spoke to them 
And told them how they could each 
Have had the chance to join him 
If they’d wanted to be there in reach   
Young John held on intently 
The man could only smile 
And look down upon him gently 
Letting him come all the while   
All the boy desired was the pleasure 
Of ministering to his loved one 
The yearning which no heart can measure 
Since he felt as if he were a son   
The two, they had such a good visit 
The conversation, so private was it all 
The master made comment of it 
That to no one a word should fall   
A unique day in time and space 
But not so strange or odd 
If any had wanted so badly could face 
A day alone with God

# Time and time out

Author: **K. Brendi Poppel**

<!--left-->
Time is a measure of material momentum, 
But when time stands still.... 
The universe whispers a song to my soul, 
For an instant my heart is fulfilled. 
Here and there we can taste of eternity, 
In the silent spaces where no time exists, 
Where God speaks in the language of lovers, 
Unlike the manipulations of materialists. 
In the mechanistic mold which we have made, 
Our days are divided into segmented spaces, 
This business prevents the Spirit from penetrating 
The prison we have built to encase us. 

Time out from the tumult of non-stoppable action! 
The never-ending traffic that pollutes our view, 
Time out from the scheduled sequence we follow! 
The essence of eternity can hardly break through ... 
The cacophony we’ve created, the commotion and clatter, 
We sabotage ourselves with meaningless chatter. 

I behold you in love, and then do I see ... 
Time suspended, transcended ... eternity ... 
Where lives intertwine in the cosmic design, 
With each one included in the indelibly divine 
Pattern we perceive, the Masterful Plan, 
Is a blueprint to believe beyond this life span ... 
Time is but the beginning, our entry on earth, 
A passage that presages our spiritual rebirth. 
When we take time, we open the door 
To the Spirit, who is waiting for the call, 
To come into our hearts and transform our lives, 
By opening our eyes to the WONDER OF IT ALL !!!

# An Expression of Cosmic Worship

Since he discovered the book in 1972, David Glass’ poems and articles inspired by the revelation have appeared in many Urantia movement publications. After two years in the Portland, OR area, David recently relocated back to Dallas-Ft.Worth. 

<!--centered-->
Oh, Father of all the inhabited worlds, 
true Godhead of galaxies, star-drifts, and suns, 
we adore your Enormity. Stupendous whirls 
of great nebular arms and vast space-sweeping runs 
of subliminal energies infinitesimal, 
ranging the star-fields, are shining on earths 
far remote from our world, which is experimental 
and finding its place in your cosmos; new births 
of galactic star-clouds taking form in the ethers, 
encircling the cosmic domain’s shining brilliance, 
awaken great wonder in all God-believers 
who take in the vastness and utter resilience 
of all the wide, fanciful, cosmic parameters, 
lit by a myriad space-borne light-emitters. 
<br/>
Radiant glories untold from your heartbeats 
are pulsing throughout all the circuits and lanes 
of the starry dimensions in regular repeats 
of outward-gushed energiesósovereign reigns 
of Omnipotent Power upholding each atom 
and every ultimaton throughout the regions. 
Life permeates all the series of atomic, 
vivified life -forms, now numbering legions, 
and all the assemblage of God-produced creatures, 
observant and growing bright Children of Light, 
sing their anthems of homage to you, whose vast features 
are beamed from your Prior, Pre-manifest Brightness 
of Absolute Oneness, turned Ceaseless Endeavor, 
unending expansion for your and our pleasure.

# Poem by Emily Bronte

<!--left-->
No Coward soul is mine 
No trembler in the world’s storm troubled sphere 
I see Heaven’s glories shine, 
And faith shines equal, arming me from fear  

O God within my breast 
Almighty ever present Deity! 
Life, that in me has rest 
As I, Undying Life, have power in thee!  

Vain are the thousand creeds 
That move men’s hearts, unutterably vain; 
Worthless as withered weeds, 
Or idlest froth amid the boundless main.  

To waken doubt in one 
Holding so fast by thy infinity, 
So Surely anchored on 
The steadfast rock of Immortality  

With wide embracing love 
Thy spirit animates eternal years, 
Pervades and broods above, 
Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears.  

Though earth and moon were gone, 
And suns and universes ceased to be, 
And thou wert left alone.  

There is not room for Death, 
Nor atom that his might could render void; 
Since thou art Being and Breath 
And what thou art may never be destroyed.  

2nd January, 1846  

> The poem, which according to her sister Charlotte, were the last lines Emily Bronte wrote, is untitled.

> There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving! (p. 365)
