# Unity

*by David Glass*

<!--centered-->
We all shall know the harmony of spirit
Attuning us to inner unity,
A demonstration of our kindred spirit
As children of the same One Deity.
The many variations that divide us
Shall be eclipsed by transcendental love.
The inner spirit's working shall unite us
In oneness both on earth and then above
As rays projected out from one bright Centel
Retracted to divinity shall we
Be drawn unto the Universal Center,
The focus of Eternal Harmony,
The primacy of spirit gives us kinship -
A universal family of friendship.

# The basket

Author: **Charlene Morrow**

<!--centered-->
It happened on the very last Wednesday 
Almost all the bright days were gone 
It was a day of rest, as was their way 
The master walked toward the hills alone   
Guards were offered for him by 
David Knowing that these were times of danger 
But with legions of angels awaiting his bid 
He had no fear of friend or stranger   
He walked away, but in a short time 
Was offered a basket of food for the day 
He reached for the handle ready to climb 
And turned to walk on his solitary way   
John Mark held on to the basket 
Gripping on firmly and strong 
He’d made up his mind to carry it 
If needed for all the day long   
The apostles, they couldn’t believe their eyes 
They were shocked at the temerity of the lad 
Deep in their hearts they could not deny 
They were jealous, lonely, and sad   
Later on Nathaniel spoke to them 
And told them how they could each 
Have had the chance to join him 
If they’d wanted to be there in reach   
Young John held on intently 
The man could only smile 
And look down upon him gently 
Letting him come all the while   
All the boy desired was the pleasure 
Of ministering to his loved one 
The yearning which no heart can measure 
Since he felt as if he were a son   
The two, they had such a good visit 
The conversation, so private was it all 
The master made comment of it 
That to no one a word should fall   
A unique day in time and space 
But not so strange or odd 
If any had wanted so badly could face 
A day alone with God

# Time and time out

Author: **K. Brendi Poppel**

<!--left-->
Time is a measure of material momentum, 
But when time stands still.... 
The universe whispers a song to my soul, 
For an instant my heart is fulfilled. 
Here and there we can taste of eternity, 
In the silent spaces where no time exists, 
Where God speaks in the language of lovers, 
Unlike the manipulations of materialists. 
In the mechanistic mold which we have made, 
Our days are divided into segmented spaces, 
This business prevents the Spirit from penetrating 
The prison we have built to encase us. 

Time out from the tumult of non-stoppable action! 
The never-ending traffic that pollutes our view, 
Time out from the scheduled sequence we follow! 
The essence of eternity can hardly break through ... 
The cacophony we’ve created, the commotion and clatter, 
We sabotage ourselves with meaningless chatter. 

I behold you in love, and then do I see ... 
Time suspended, transcended ... eternity ... 
Where lives intertwine in the cosmic design, 
With each one included in the indelibly divine 
Pattern we perceive, the Masterful Plan, 
Is a blueprint to believe beyond this life span ... 
Time is but the beginning, our entry on earth, 
A passage that presages our spiritual rebirth. 
When we take time, we open the door 
To the Spirit, who is waiting for the call, 
To come into our hearts and transform our lives, 
By opening our eyes to the WONDER OF IT ALL !!!

# An Expression of Cosmic Worship

Since he discovered the book in 1972, David Glass’ poems and articles inspired by the revelation have appeared in many Urantia movement publications. After two years in the Portland, OR area, David recently relocated back to Dallas-Ft.Worth. 

<!--centered-->
Oh, Father of all the inhabited worlds, 
true Godhead of galaxies, star-drifts, and suns, 
we adore your Enormity. Stupendous whirls 
of great nebular arms and vast space-sweeping runs 
of subliminal energies infinitesimal, 
ranging the star-fields, are shining on earths 
far remote from our world, which is experimental 
and finding its place in your cosmos; new births 
of galactic star-clouds taking form in the ethers, 
encircling the cosmic domain’s shining brilliance, 
awaken great wonder in all God-believers 
who take in the vastness and utter resilience 
of all the wide, fanciful, cosmic parameters, 
lit by a myriad space-borne light-emitters. 
<br/>
Radiant glories untold from your heartbeats 
are pulsing throughout all the circuits and lanes 
of the starry dimensions in regular repeats 
of outward-gushed energiesósovereign reigns 
of Omnipotent Power upholding each atom 
and every ultimaton throughout the regions. 
Life permeates all the series of atomic, 
vivified life -forms, now numbering legions, 
and all the assemblage of God-produced creatures, 
observant and growing bright Children of Light, 
sing their anthems of homage to you, whose vast features 
are beamed from your Prior, Pre-manifest Brightness 
of Absolute Oneness, turned Ceaseless Endeavor, 
unending expansion for your and our pleasure.

# Poem by Emily Bronte

<!--left-->
No Coward soul is mine 
No trembler in the world’s storm troubled sphere 
I see Heaven’s glories shine, 
And faith shines equal, arming me from fear  

O God within my breast 
Almighty ever present Deity! 
Life, that in me has rest 
As I, Undying Life, have power in thee!  

Vain are the thousand creeds 
That move men’s hearts, unutterably vain; 
Worthless as withered weeds, 
Or idlest froth amid the boundless main.  

To waken doubt in one 
Holding so fast by thy infinity, 
So Surely anchored on 
The steadfast rock of Immortality  

With wide embracing love 
Thy spirit animates eternal years, 
Pervades and broods above, 
Changes, sustains, dissolves, creates, and rears.  

Though earth and moon were gone, 
And suns and universes ceased to be, 
And thou wert left alone.  

There is not room for Death, 
Nor atom that his might could render void; 
Since thou art Being and Breath 
And what thou art may never be destroyed.  

2nd January, 1846  

> The poem, which according to her sister Charlotte, were the last lines Emily Bronte wrote, is untitled.

> There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless opportunity, unlimited progress, and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving! (p. 365)

# Last Mountain In Vancouver

<!--left-->
My dear friend
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did across an open field in Lake Forest
Where the summer grass grows green and thick
And autumn gives birth to Plains of fire
A passageway to the sun
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did through a mountain valley in Snowmass
Where spring breezes skid across the evergreens
And winters play snow White symphonies
A passageway to the stars
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did over the Grand Canyon
Where the sun pierces through fresh skin
And pummels the soul with warmth
A passageway to the sky
Your laughter echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it did through a corridor in Vancouver
Where flowers bloom in cascades
And mountains make a cosmos
Sitting, laughing, steeling our vision
A world we would energize
A universe we would capsize
But now I reach and cannot touch you
I listen and cannot hear you
But I Still stand beside you
A misfortune has blunted your heart for some time
And seized your laughter
That echoes through my heart like wind chimes
The way it Will when we meet again somewhere on this Earth
Where your persistence personified Will reign
And laughter shall echo like wind chimes
You, our passageway to Paradise
And without your light, a mission much darkened
Far away, I reach to kindle your soul
With the flame you placed in mine
And stand on the brink of the universe, waiting.
Praying for you,

# NOT WHAT WE GIVE... BUT WHAT WE SHARE...

The following verses are excerpts from "The Vision of Sir Launfal" by James Russell Lowell. Sir Launfal has returned from the Crusades a beggar, his arrogance broken, and with only a single crust of bread to eat, when a leper begs him for alms.

<!--left-->
And Sir Launfal said, "I behold in thee
An image of him who died on the tree;
Behold, through him, I give to thee!"
He parted in twain his single crust,
He broke the ice on the streamlet's brink,
And gave the leper to eat and drink,
As Sir Launfal mused with a downcast face,
A light shone round about the place;
The leper no longer crouched at his side,
But stood before him glorified,
Shining and tall and fair and straight
As the pillar that stood by the Beautiful Gate, —
Himself the Gate whereby men can
Enter the temple of God in Man.
His words were shed softer than leaves from the pine,
And they fell on Sir Launfal as snows on the brine,
That mingle their softness and quiet in one
With the shaggy unrest they float down upon;
And the voice that was calmer than silence said,
"Lo, it is I, be not afraid!
In many climes, without avail,
Thou hast spent thy life for the Holy Grail;
Behold it is here, this cup which thou
Didst fill at the streamlet for me but now;
This crust is my body broken for thee,
This water His blood that died on the tree;
The Holy Supper is kept, indeed,
In whatso we share with another's need;
Not what we give, but what we share, —
For the gift without the giver is bare;
Who gives himsclf with his alms feeds three,
Himself, his hungering neighbor, and me."

# Evening Prayer

Go who makes the angels bright
God who guards the darkest night

I am your child
I need your love
My fears relieve!
My thoughts above make moments tender

Focus my faith so I remember
that as I seek so shall I find

Come, cure the wild and aimless mind

Cast out the doubt of heavenly might
And keep me always in your sight

Forever lead me into light.

# PRAYER FROM ANOTHER WORLD

Glorious Father and Mother, in one parent combined, 
Loyal would we be to your divine nature.
Your own self to live again in and through us 
By the gift and bestowal of your divine spirit, 
Thus reproducing you imperfectly in this sphere
As you are perfectly and majestically shown on high. 
Give us day by day your sweet ministry of brotherhood 
And lead us moment by moment in the pathway of loving service
Be you ever and unfailingly patient with us
Even as we show forth your patience to our children. 
Give us the divine wisdom that does all thing's well 
And the infinite love that is gracious to every creatue. 
Bestow upon us your patience and loving-kindness 
That our charity may enfold the weak of the realm. 
And when our career is finished, make it an honor
to your name, a pleasure to your good spirit, and a 
satisfaction to our soul helpers.

Not as we wish, our loving Father, but as you desire the 
eternal good of your mortal children,

Even so may it be. [144:5.61] (P. 1623)

# Anti-Terror Treatise

<!--center-->
When I shed the suit of worry
That I carry on me day and night,
When I strip away the anxious bands
Of tightly held beliefs,
I stand naked to the gaze of God, and I tremble.

What happens then is nothing short of cosmic love:
Down from the utmost reaches of my mind
Stream consciousness and light in healing waves of wonder.
Enfolded, embraced within supreme creative being,
I am surrounded by the power of righteous thought.
I behold as I am beheld.

What I had clutched to me as vital crumbles into dust.
Selfish hopes are whisked to insignificance
By a force at once benign and beautiful
That powers stars and galaxies,
Yet makes me feel beloved,
At home, encouraged.

The love that forgives, serves. resurrects, remembers,
Showers down on me and on my world of pain and fear.

Our God makes all things newt in spite of our determined doubt.
If I remove rny tiny self, God is there in radiance and mercy.

How can I cling to outmoded ways,
When our world is breaking open before astonished eyes?

# Thy Kingdom Come

O love divine, You arc the seed from which each one of us was born to life. 
Far as the stars, close as our hearts,
You are.....
Your holy Name is uttered everywherc. 
Wake us into full remembrance of Your love. 
Guide us ever to our home, which is with You, that joyous life which you have planned for us through all eternity...
The power and the glory of existence sings within us all: every atom breathes Your breath. 
May we know our holiness as Yours, forevermore. ....
Give us the certainty that all our needs are met through faith in You, whatever be Your Will for us. 
And may it be our Will to Clear the path within that leads to You, to open
every door in welcome and in trust to You, who waits within us, welcoming our remembrance, rejoicing in our love....
Forgive us, and may we bc forgiving toward ourselves, that we forget so often who we are. 
Our own true nature is a godliness; we are of You....
Others, too, who know not fully who they are and play the game of separation in so many ways, may we forgive in full, knowing that their faults are but our own...
Deliver us from all our blindnesses unto the meaning of our lives....
As lights within Your greater light, may we remember You forevcr in the now, in darkness as in day May human love complete your radiance on earth, that we may join with heaven here. Amen

# The Soul’s Expression

With stammering lips and insufficient sound 
I strive and struggle to deliver right
That music of my nature, day and night
With dream and thought and feeling interwound,
And inly answering all the senses round 
With octaves of a mystic depth and height 
Which step out grandly to the infinite 
From the dark edges of the sensual ground. 
This song of soul I struggle to outbear
Through portals of the sense, sublime and whole,
And utter all myself into the air; 
But if I did it, as the thunder roll
Breaks its own cloud, my flesh would perish there, 
Before that dread apocalypse of soul.

Elizabeth Barrett Browning

# Room In My Heart

There is a spacious place inside my heart that waits, 
wanting you to come and stay,
an empty room inside the house I’m sweeping out, 
where you’ll abide forever I pray.

The sunlight shimmers on a stucco wall, 
rippling through the leaves.
It lights a space that meditation seeks, 
a quiet place where shadows play.

Now since you broke my darkness with a golden ray, 
sunlight that came piercing through,
I’ve seen this life was always in such disarray 
true purpose I just never knew.

The dust and cobwebs of confusion too
are being swept away.
And in this house anticipation gleams,
knowing it’s been prepared for you.

# Wonderment and revelation

Wonderment and revelation 
Span the cosmos with their joys, 
And among the hosts of heaven, 
Each his spirit-love employs

Just to win another mortal
To the Father’s timeless plan, 
And to cheer him in his progress 
Toward the bliss awaiting man,

Never can there be an ending; 
Never can adventure halt,
For each level of the journey 
Leads each person to exalt

Everything the Father wishes, 
All the love he would express, 
Giving us the joys of sonship 
And eternal happiness.

How can I withhold my service? 
How can I allow a day
Here to pass without exhorting 
Everyone to find his way

Through the tumult of this planet 
‘Til the time he must depart, 
Soon again in loftier mansions 
To resume? In truth, to start

In that climb that leads him Godward, 
Ne’er again to be a man
On this splendid world of wonder, 
Ne’er to be its dust again.

For each person is an offspring 
Of the Father’s will-to-love,
And he’ll draw his far-flung family 
Home to endless joys above.

# A Reed Singing

I am just a reed..
You will not notice me here.
While still a seed,
I found myself lodged
in a patch of hard earth.
When a trickle of water
discovered my hiding place,
my roots took hold.

More rain fell;
it flowed gloriously
around my pale root and tender sprout.
I clung to this harsh slope,
facing south,
I was given sunshine,
and I grew.

I am just a reed, nothing to you.
Not even one transformed by human hands
into a flute, making music.
But when a marine gale
sweeps across the wind-bitten hill,
blowing between our long stems,
even reeds will sing.

It is then that we praise
the Lord of our creation,
for we seem of small consequence,
yet we have life.
It is precious,
and we give praise.

# A Good Way For Us To Live Our Lives  

One law the Master shared with all of us; 
One precept which surpasses every thought; 
He taught that men in timeless Brotherhood 
Are sons of one true Father. Truth has sought  

To be the Center of our outward Love; 
The Truth of Living Sonship with one’s God; 
The global and the universal Truth 
That gives us heav’nly glory. We have trod  

Upon this planet several years and seen 
Its ghastly ironies and untold sorrow; 
But we do know that should we now proclaim 
God’s timeless Truths, there will come a tomorrow  

In which the conflicts of our present globe 
Shall be refashioned in a better light 
In which the Father’s bidding will be done 
And Truth will spread her radiant beams of Light.  

We have an opportunity to Serve: 
Proclaiming Jesus’ Truth and sharing Love 
That all may be in-gathered to his Heart 
And life below resemble life above.

# The Book - a Poem

Author: **M. Sanders**

Some time past, on a fortunate day,
without intention I chanced to stray,
a trifle from my appointed way.
To a used bookstore with crowded aisles.
Books everywhere in stacks and piles.

As my eyes adjusted to the gloom,
within this dim-lit dusky room,
the shadows all but did consume
the legends on each titled spine.
One beckoned me, and I read the line.

“The Central and Super Universe
Complete.”
What a singularly awesome feat,
an astounding literary treat.
A bright blue volume tooled in gold.
What treasured knowledge could it hold.

Perhaps chance was not my guide that day.
Deliberate plan may have paved the way,
while unseen forces were brought into play.
Closer I peered for a better look.
A strange title…”_The Urantia Book_.”

Urantia? What a curious word.
A peculiar one I’d never heard.
Was it profound, or merely absurd?
The first line of the book, made claim,
“Urantia” is the Spiritual name,

Of this our planet, our home, our world.
While around the sun our system hurled,
And far beyond, the universe swirled.
With endless systems much like ours.
All made by design of higher powers.

If this, in fact, is the actual case.
Then we’re not alone in infinite space.
There’s real purpose to the human race.
Our existence has rationality,
with order, design and destiny.

Could I dare to hope, trust or surmise,
that here in my hands, before my eyes
lay revealed an unparalleled prize?
Would answers now be given me?
To questions that have driven me?

Would this knowledge now at my command,
Finally help me to understand.
How all of existence was really planned?
Great pearls of promise on every page,
dispatched to earth by celestial sage.

This just might be the golden key.
To answers that could set us free,
unlocking the door of mystery.
To the portal where enigma resides.
The scared place where wisdom abides.

Where all schools of thought are in
compliance,
Philosophy, Art, Religion and Science.
In one harmonious alliance.
To a table in a near-by nook
with eager hands I carried the book.

My mind with curiosity burned.
For printed on each page I turned,
were new perceptions to be learned.
Data extracted from time and space.
Bestowed on us from a lofty place.

On each fascinating page I read,
the incredible things the volume said.
Not the deceit of victors, long dead.
Who, truth had twisted, then realigned
to sooth their conscience and quiet their
mind.

Retreating in time to the absolute start.
To when the “I AM” first moved apart.
Beyond all beginnings that we can chart,
Infinity, Eternity, time and space.
Each one assigned to its rightful place.

To the Creator’s first volitional act.
When endless void was forever cracked,
When time and space became a fact.
Unfolding eons from then ‘til now.
Revealing why, what, where, when and how.

It said we’re a part of that infinite source.
Alive within the eternal force,
embarking on an immortal course.
For every soul that seeks survival,
a place awaits for their arrival.

On the far off shore of our endless quest,
we’ll be greeted as a welcome guest
and treated to a well earned rest.
A brief sojourn on this mansion sphere,
then onward with our immortal career.

Once you’ve chosen this course to stay,
Forever within, the spirit will say
“doubt not, nor falter, this is the way.”
As you listen to that still small voice
Reminding, you it’s always your choice.

In the darkness every soul is blind.
Face into the light and you will find,
the shadows of fear all fall behind.
While deep in your mind it still rings true
And you realize that you always knew.

Although you’ll encounter shades of gray,
by seeking the light, come what may,
there is no failure, only delay.
Your destiny is never in doubt.
The survival plan is all worked out.

Because we host the creator’s spark.
It’s never too late for us to embark,
on the well-lit path out of the dark.
Inward and homeward age after age,
On a trek mapped out page after page.

There’s no adventure that is greater,
Than the Quest that sooner or later.
Returns us all to our Creator.
Even as our “Elder Brother” knew.
His Father is our Father, too.

With his life on earth he tried to show,
His love for us, so we would know.
God’s love for his children here below.
No cruel God of spite or jealousy.
But one who nurtures us lovingly.

Who reaches out across time and space.
A small fragment of himself to place,
within the minds of the human race.
Each living soul is his to cherish.
He never meant that any should perish.

# We Are the Creatures Who Carry the Life 

<!-- centered-->
We are the creatures who carry the life. 
We strive hard to make you your life. 
We are your ancestors. 

We are the ones who helped make you possible. 
You can’t live without us. 
Did you know that we are the ones who helped you grow? 

We started by planting a seed in shallow warm bays 
And watched over it for many, many days. 
It started to grow big and strong 
And then many life forms evolved along. 
Then went on to shore in different sizes and shapes 
Including elephants, dolphins, bananas and apes. 

We are the ones who carry the life. 
We are the ones who strive hard to make the life. 
And do you know what happened next? 
It turned pretty complex. 
Life continued to grow bigger and bigger 
Until the world was covered with animals 
Grazing, running, jumping and playing. 

Then something magical happened. 
Monkeys started walking on two legs 
And turned into these human like creatures 
With many features 
Who lived in caves. 

Soon they started to grow and evolve 
Then they built houses and cars and bars. 
Then many of them came 
And started making cities, rockets and trains. 
They made TV’s, movies and all kinds of crazy stuff, 
Books and cartoons and I don’t know what. 

We moved on to another planet 
They had lives of their own 
This is how far time has gone along. 
Please ask no more, it’s the end of my song.

# One in Ten Million  

Author: **Francis E. Baca**

It seemed you were favored, Urantia. 
With gifted Prince Caligastia at the helm 
Progress was smooth 
You abode in the truth 
A bright future for the immature realm. 

Then the System Sovereign let darkness enfold him 
Exalting himself Lucifer went astray 
Assuring worlds he would lead them 
To “self-determination” and “freedom” 
There was war in the heavens that day. 

Lucifer’s aide, Satan, came to Caligastia 
And urged him to join in their plan 
To spurn evolution 
And embrace revolution 
Progress ended and mayhem began. 

It was a catastrophe of chaos and confusion 
Bitter harvest of the Prince’s betrayal 
“Liberated” peoples on a rampage 
A speedy end to the rebels’ new age 
Urantia adrift, like a ship with no sail. 

Yet throughout the grim years of rebellion 
A saga of valor and heroism was told 
Of Van and Amadon, who stood fast 
With Gabriel’s armies to the last 
Gallant leaders of the Father’s shattered fold. 

Spiritual dark ages followed 
In savagery the races continued to languish 
Still Van did not falter 
He said a Material Son and Daughter 
Would come to lift the world out from its anguish. 

Van’s followers built the Garden of Eden 
And what joy when the day finally came 
For the world to receive 
Its new rulers, Adam and Eve 
And all thanked the Father, praising his name. 

But isolated and alone on a rebellion ravaged sphere 
Adam and Eve’s bright hopes turned to despair 
Caligastia, sly and adroit 
Seized the opportunity to exploit 
The frustration of the well-meaning pair. 

Although warned not to mix good with evil 
The noble duo would become impatient and stray 
Reduced to mortals they fled 
The lands near Eden flowed red 
The apostate Prince once again had his way. 

Oh Urantia, what more can befall you 
Is there no end to your sorrowful plight 
Are you doomed to remain 
In misery and pain 
Have you any strength with to fight? 

But the Creator Son had not forgotten Urantia 
When Michael enacted his final bestowal 
Of ten million worlds he chose 
The neediest of those 
To reveal the Father’s mercy and love for us all. 

Melchizedek and John the Baptist made ready the way 
For Jesus, who the dust of earth trod 
Consumed with the desire 
To do the Father’s will and inspire 
Mankind to live as brethren in one family of God. 

Christ’s bestowal brought an end to insurrection 
And the wicked rebels have ever since 
Been stripped of all power 
Can only helplessly cower 
Before the man-God, the planet’s new Prince. 

Urantia remains a sin-darkened sphere 
Though with an Archangels division at hand 
And the universe humming 
Over Christ’s second coming 
It rides the threshold of a future quite grand. 

You’re one in ten million, Urantia 
And when all is said and done 
This “World of the Cross” 
Of suffering and loss 
Is the envy of all Nebadon. 
One in Ten Million

# Healing Meditation 

Creative Life Force coursing through me, 
With vibrations of healing energy, 
Renewing my body, mind and soul, 
Making me a whole, healthy being, 
Divinely freeing the child in me, 
I am wonderfully wild, spontaneously free... 

I let everything go as the Spirit surges, 
With words flowing forth as wisdom emerges, 
Intuitive insight empowers my hearing, 
Time and space disappearing in the everpresent NOW... 

Lord, show me how to transform and transcend, 
Mend my broken spirit, restore my troubled mind, 
In the healing, holy presence I know I can find my way 
Out of the darkness and into the dawn, 
Once more in the Light, I am being reborn, 
As I breathe in blessings from God within and above, 

I tune into a universe of infinite love...

# A Confederate Soldier’s Prayer 

Author Unknown   

( Attributed to a battle weary CSA soldier near the end of the war)  

I asked God for strength, that I might achieve; 

I was made weak, that I might learn humbly to obey 

I asked for health, that I might do greater things; 

I was given infirmity, that I might do better things. 

I asked for riches, that I might be happy; 

I was given poverty, that I might be wise. 

I asked for power, that I might have the praise of men; 

I was given weakness, that I might feel the need of God. 

I asked for all things, that I might enjoy life; 

I was given life, that I might enjoy all things. 

I got nothing that I asked for, but everything I hoped for. 

Almost despite myself, my unspoken prayers were answered. 

I am among all men most richly blessed.

# There Was a Man Once 

_by Errol Strider_ 

There was a man once, truly that 
Who is known for the cross that he bore 
But who laughed in the market 
And slept on the floor 
Who designed riverboats in Capernaum 
Studied the ways of all men 
In order to rule in perfection 
With its trials, upsets, and demands 
A universe of 10 million planets 
Which the man, who upholds it 
Designed, fashioned and planned. 

There was a man once, truly that. 
Who embraced the mortal dilemma 
With a boundless trust 
And abiding faith. 
Who was immersed in a River Jordan 
Allowing himself to give in 
To life as we know it in fullness 
With its sores, its aches and injustice 
But which serves a great hidden purpose 
Which the man, who entered its bowels 
Could foresee what to us is so dim. 

There was a man once, truly that 
Who transcended all tradition and dogma 
Who forgave the sin 
And loved the sinner 
Who feared not one who attacked him 
But attempted to show them the truth. 
By example, he sat in their presence, 
With his words, his acts, and entreaties 
He sought to convince those around him 
That all men could live as he 
Secure, abandoned and free. 

There was a man once, truly that 
A man who broke from his elders 
Made friends with the poor 
Played with the kids 
Made choices like all other men 
To use power for good or for evil 
To be simple or prideful and vain 
Grappled with grief, failure, betrayal, 
But still to remain steadfast to the 
God, Who this man knew always as Father and friend. 
There was a man once, truly that. 

Who did not what others expected 
Disappointing his pupils 
Estranging his mother 
Rejecting requests of the masses 
When they wanted to make him king 
Yet allowed them to place down the palms 
As he rode on an ass to the city 
Where they rejected once and for all 
This true man, who understood them 
And forgave their blindness and gall. 

There was a man once, truly that. 
A man whom we all misinterpret 
Who knows all as his brother 
To the exclusion of none 
Who did not really die on the cross 
To wash away our sins 
But to reveal a God of mercy 
Who forgives, only loves, has compassion 
On his ignorant children who err 
So this man died only to show them 
How far love would go for them. 

There was a man once, truly that. 
Whose life on this beleaguered planet 
Was a model for all to behold. 
Who revealed our humanity to us 
What each person can actually become 
When we join with this man in knowing 
The Spirit that indwells our hearts. 
And as he rose from the darkness of death 
And appeared to those who knew him 
He showed us the path to aliveness... 
The deep forever mystery 
Of the timeless journey of love.

# An Encounter This Unique 

_by Duane R. Johnson_ 

I’m not likely to forget an encounter this unique: 
an epiphany is emerging from my interface 
with the boundaries of Little Lake Shawnee, 
a natural lake for children, our little ones, 
drained while improvements are made. 

Stones, uniformly carved and faithfully fitted 
to this tiny lake’s old shoreline 
form a collar-colored wall, a boundary 
four feet high. 

Coincidentally perhaps, I’ve been pushing 
the envelope of my collared mind 
to explore the expanding boundaries of the evolving God, 
One that grows by embracing and becoming 
the experience of each and every one of us 
in our cornucopic encounters with each other. 

And now, this encounter with a wall, 
intelligently crafted, though unaware of me 
as I tightrope along the edge of it 
to an unfinished spot where there is no wall 
—a 60-foot gap, intended 
for some purpose I don’t comprehend. 

I sense an unspoken promise in that unknown purpose, 
one self-similar to the greater Mystery I’ve been stalking 
as It emerges, self-aware and with holy purpose. 

I believe I’m emerging as well, 
which may explain why I see promise in mystery, 
whereas, in my youth, as a little one, 
I trembled at unknown gaps. 

The next time I visit this part of the park 
I expect I’ll see this puzzle solved. 
Not so with the Mystery that is the evolving God, 
an enigma born at the dawn of time and space 
and promising not to be fully revealed 
until eons from now. 

We have a choice to remain in this unfolding mystery 
sometimes draining ourselves while improvements are made 
fearlessly exploring the supreme intelligence behind the wall, 
all the while being gifted to know 
we are the little ones, and God keeps his promises.

# Poem to our Parents 

_by Sharon Porter_

I don’t need to wait ‘til Father’s Day to tell you my Father, Creator Michael, to say, 
I love you Father 
Buying you a gift our dear Divine Mother would be in excess, 
just another fad, to say to you I love you Mother, 
my Creator, would be to tell the truth 
Thank you dear Divine Parents for being my mom and dad 
for being my real parents 
for creating me, 
loving me, nurturing and teaching me 
Oh, what Majestic Beauties You Are! 
Thank You

# Song for Papa’s Family 

Dear Friends, I have written a poem inspired by a brief and famous verse by the celebrated English Victorian poet, Robert Browning, “Pippa Passes.” The poem I have written takes Browning's as its base, from which I have composed a poem of my own. My poem is intended to express the idea that, no matter on what universe level we may find ourselves, whether on earth or upon some higher sphere—we shall always maintain an awareness of the reality of the personality relationships and group identities we established here on earth. True and real relationships we form and develop here—whether as friends or fellows, in families or teamwork groups—will continue to relate us, each to each and all together, as we continue to pursue God’s plan, to better comprehend it, and thereby further cultivate the fellowship we formed on Earth. 

Our unity of purpose, our voluntary teamwork, continues ever afterward to vitalize our relationships on ever-heightening levels. Personality relationships, as we know, are an end in themselves. As such they are among the tiny number of revealed realities that can be distinguished in that way. Like the personalities themselves of which they are composed, personality relationships maintain a constant value. They are possessed of a unique and unaltering reality, an enduring and final survival value, that never can or ever shall be diminished or destroyed to any degree. Personality relationships as unique universe realities will only be rendered more profound, more enriched, and more meaningful by the numberless, expanding and diversifying experiences that lie ahead throughout our lengthy and intriguing universe journeys. 

All of us are one in love, unified by one purpose, and united in one destiny, forever to pursue and to realize our Creator’s never- ending plan of universe expansion. We are one family who together make real the fullness of our Father’s dreams. 

## Song for Papa’s Family 

by David Glass 

The year is at autumn, arriving so soon, 
The morning’s at seven and climbing toward noon, 
The lark has ascended, she sails through the sky, 
The snail’s on the thorn, though he’s looking on high. 
God's in Havona, but dwells in us too, 
Singing a love song to each one of you. 
Spirit, advancing through all cosmic space, 
Transmits our love to our friends in their place. 
Whether in heaven or Earth we may seek 
To do God’s will, there the Spirit will speak, 
Saying to each of us: “This is the way. 
Let no misgivings come near you today. 
Whether or not your friends walk by your side, 
Walk in My light, let My love be your guide.” 
We know the truth that expands every day 
Leading us all to that new brighter day 
We seek by our service to manifest here 
At one with our friends on higher new spheres. 
Knowing our labors with theirs are entwined 
We sense how deeply our wills are aligned, 
Bridging the gap that seems otherwise strong 
When all sing together God’s “uni-verse” song, 
That “one-song” of love and of spirit divine 
That unites our service as upward we climb. 
We have assurances, here and above: 
Nothing is greater or stronger than Love. 
It links each level of heaven and earth, 
Bringing from losses a sense of rebirth: 
We honor One Spirit and serve but One Son. 
Whatever our station, our efforts are one. 
Our voices in unison sing out our praise 
With hope for the future to last all our days. 
Our service is cosmic wherever we strive. 
That oneness of spirit unites all our lives 
To do all the biddings of Light and of Love 
Till God's reign on Earth is like that above.

# Thinking of my Divine Mother, aka the Holy Spirit 

by Karen Larsen 

Mother of heart 
Mother of Mind 
Mother who surrounds us, 
all through time. 
Mother of kindness 
compassion and care, 
Mother who holds us 
from everywhere. 
Teach me the lessons 
my soul longs to learn, 
and then, let me teach 
others in turn. 
Mother who made us 
from a single breath 
Mother who loves each, 
and all the rest. 
Our Mother in heaven 
who watches our walk, 
who is always listening 
waiting to talk. 
Oh Dear Divine Mother 
Who is deep in my soul, 
Lead me and guide me 
As I grow old.

# To Our Mother Spirit, the Holy Spirit, the Giver of Mind 

by Mary Huggins 

Me: I so wish to truly KNOW you! 

MY CHILD, 

I am as close as your thoughts 
I give mind 
I am as close as your beating heart 
I give life 
I am as close as your lungs 
I give breath 
I am as close as your body 
I give being to your very cells. 

See me in the minds and bodies of those you love, 
in acquaintances, in strangers passing by, 
in those you fear, even your enemies. 
See me especially in those who would destroy you. 
All these are your brothers and sisters, my children, 
they are my beloveds, just as you are, my adored child. 

See me in the trees and clouds and grass, 
even in the vegetables you grow for food. 
See me in the cows, the pigs, the chickens, 
the creatures of the sea, created to nourish you. 
See me also in the weeds you dig up, 
and the bears and lions and wolves whom you fear. 

See me in your animal friends and pets, 
dogs and cats and horses, 
birds even lizards and snakes 
yet the tiniest bugs and myriad insects. 
They are all a part of me. 
Each has his role to play. 

See me in the natural beauty around you— 
green plants and blue sky, fall colors, 
spring flowers, that delicious spring green, 
that impossible blue sky behind the magnificent sunset. 
I am in the winter drab as well as the snowy white. 
See me in landscapes beyond your imagination, 
mountains and valleys, rocks, oceans and rushing rivers 
canyons and majestic vistas. 

See me in harmonious paintings, sculptures, 
even buildings and landscapes created with human hands. 
See me in poetry and music birthed 
by my gift of mind used to express 
both practical and spiritual relationships. 
You see, I am in and of all that is around and within you. 
You are of me and I am of you. 
Yet I am not you and I am still more than you, 
I am myself. 
I am. 

This is how you will know me, child: pay attention to what is there, look with spiritual eyes, with the intention of finding me. In wanting and longing to know me, you already know me. Continue coming to me in quiet times, in times of fun and laughter, in good food and companionship, in hard labor and in your rest. As I am everywhere, will you find me, but only because you seek me. If you do not seek me, I am hidden, nowhere to be seen. Seeking is the key. Seeking me opens many doors. 

Seek me, my beloved child. I answer each and every sincere call. 

I love you very much, dear one. 


Your Mother, whom you know as the Holy Spirit
