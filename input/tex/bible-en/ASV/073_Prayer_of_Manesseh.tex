\title{Prayer of Manesseh}

\chapter{1}

\par 1 O Lord, Almighty God of our fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, | and of their righteous seed
\par 2 thou who hast made heaven and earth | with all their order;
\par 3 who hast shackled the sea by thy word of command, | who hast confined the deep | and sealed it with thy terrible and glorious name;
\par 4 at whom all things shudder, | and tremble before thy power,
\par 5 for thy glorious splendor cannot be borne, | and the wrath of thy threat to sinners is irresistible;
\par 6 yet immeasurable and unsearchable is thy promised mercy,
\par 7 for thou art the Lord Most High, | of great compassion, long-suffering, and very merciful, | and repentest over the evils of men. | Thou, O Lord, according to thy great goodness | hast promised repentance and forgiveness | to those who have sinned against thee; | and in the multitude of thy mercies | thou hast appointed repentance for sinners, | that they may be saved.
\par 8 Therefore thou, O Lord, God of the righteous, | hast not appointed repentance for the righteous, | for Abraham and Isaac and Jacob, who did not sin against thee, | but thou hast appointed repentance for me, who am a sinner.
\par 9 For the sins I have committed are more in number | than the sand of the sea; | my transgressions are multiplied, O Lord, they are multiplied! | I am unworthy to look up and see the height of heaven | because of the multitude of my iniquities.
\par 10 I am weighted down with many an iron fetter, | so that I am rejected because of my sins, | and I have no relief; | for I have provoked thy wrath | and have done what is evil in thy sight, | setting up abominations and multiplying offenses.
\par 11 And now I bend the knee of my heart, | beseeching thee for thy kindness.
\par 12 I have sinned, O Lord, I have sinned, | and I know my transgressions.
\par 13 I earnestly beseech thee, | forgive me, O Lord, forgive me! | Do not destroy me with my transgressions! | Do not be angry with me for ever or lay up evil for me; | do not condemn me to the depths of the earth. | For thou, O Lord, art the God of those who repent,
\par 14 and in me thou wilt manifest thy goodness; | for, unworthy as I am, thou wilt save me in thy great mercy,
\par 15 and I will praise thee continually all the days of my life. | For all the host of heaven sings thy praise, | and thine is the glory for ever. Amen.
