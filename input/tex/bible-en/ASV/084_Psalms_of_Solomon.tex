\title{Psalms of Solomon}

\chapter{1}

\par \textit{“They became insolent in their prosperity . . . .”}

\par 1 I cried unto the Lord when I was in distress,
\par  Unto God when sinners assailed.
\par 2 Suddenly the alarm of war was heard before me;
\par  I said, He will hearken to me for I am full of righteousness.
\par 3 I thought in my heart that I was full of righteousness,
\par  Because I was well off and had become rich in children.
\par 4 Their wealth spread to the whole earth,
\par  And their glory unto the end of the earth.
\par 5 They were exalted unto the stars;
\par  They said they would never fan.
\par 6 But they became insolent in their prosperity,
\par  And they were without understanding,
\par 7 Their sins were in secret,
\par  And even I had no knowledge of them.
\par 8 Their transgressions went beyond those of the heathen before them;
\par  They utterly polluted the holy things of the Lord.

\chapter{2}

\par \textit{The desecration of Jerusalem; captivity, murder, and raping. A psalm of utter despair.}

\par 1 When the sinner waxed proud, with a battering-ram he cast down fortified walls,
\par  And thou didst not restrain him.
\par 2 Alien nations ascended Thine altar,
\par  They trampled it proudly with their sandals;
\par 3 Because the sons of Jerusalem had defiled the holy things of the Lord,
\par  Had profaned with iniquities the offerings of God.
\par 4 Therefore He said: Cast them far from Me;
\par    .       .       .       .       .       .
\par 5 It was set at naught before God,
\par  It was utterly dishonoured;
\par 6 The sons and the daughters were m grievous captivity,
\par  Sealed was their neck, branded was it among the nations.
\par 7 According to their sins hath He done unto them,
\par  For He hath left them in the hands of them that prevailed.
\par 8 He hath turned away His face from pitying them,
\par  Young and old and their children together;
\par 9 For they had done evil one and all, in not hearkening.
\par  And the heavens were angry,
\par 10 And the earth abhorred them;
\par  For no man upon it had done what they did,
\par 11 And the earth recognized all
\par  Thy righteous judgements, O God.
\par 12 They set the sons of Jerusalem to be mocked at in return for the harlots in her;
\par  Every wayfarer entered in in the full light of day.
\par 13 They made mock with their transgressions, as they themselves were wont to do;
\par  In the full light of day they revealed their iniquities.
\par 14 And the daughters of Jerusalem were defiled in accordance with Thy judgement,
\par  Because they had defiled themselves with unnatural intercourse.
\par 15 I am pained in my bowels and my inward parts for these things.
\par    
\par 16 And yet I will justify Thee, O God, in uprightness of heart,
\par  For in Thy judgements is Thy righteousness displayed, O God.
\par 17 For Thou hast rendered to the sinners according to their deeds,
\par  Yea, according to their sins, which were very wicked.
\par 18 Thou hast uncovered their sins, that Thy judgement might be manifest;
\par  Thou hast wiped out their memorial from the earth.
\par 19 God is a righteous judge,
\par  And he is no respecter of persons.
\par 20 For the nations reproached Jerusalem, trampling it down;
\par  Her beauty was dragged down from the throne of glory.
\par 21 She girded on sackcloth instead of comely raiment,
\par  A rope was about her head instead of a crown.
\par 22 She put off the glorious diadem which God had set upon her,
\par  In dishonour was her beauty cast upon the ground.
\par 23 And I saw and entreated the Lord and said,
\par  Long enough, O Lord has Thine hand been heavy on Israel, in bringing the nations upon them.
\par 24 For they have made sport unsparingly in wrath and fierce anger;
\par  And they will make an utter end, unless Thou, O Lord, rebuke them in Thy wrath.
\par 25 For they have done. it not in zeal, but in lust of soul,
\par  Pouring out their wrath upon us with a view to rapine.
\par 26 Delay not, O God, to recompense them on their heads,
\par  To turn the pride of the dragon into dishonour. p. 107
\par 27 And I had not long to wait before God showed me the insolent one
\par  Slain on the mountains of Egypt,
\par  Esteemed of less account than the least, on land and sea;
\par 28 His body, too, borne hither and thither on the billows with much insolence,
\par  With none to bury him, because He had rejected him with dishonour.
\par 29 He reflected not that he was man,
\par  And reflected not on the latter end;
\par 30 He said: I will be lord of land and sea;
\par  And he recognized not that it is God who is great,
\par  Mighty in His great strength.
\par 31 He is king over the heavens,
\par  And judgeth kings and kingdoms.
\par 32 It is He who setteth me up in glory,
\par  And bringeth down the proud to eternal destruction in dishonour,
\par  Because they knew Him not.
\par 33 And now behold, ye princes of the earth, the judgement of the Lord,
\par  For a great king and righteous is He, judging all that is under heaven.
\par 34 Bless God, ye that fear the Lord with wisdom,
\par  For the mercy of the Lord will ~e upon them that fear Him, m the Judgement;
\par 35 So that He will distinguish between the righteous and the sinner,
\par  And recompense the sinners for ever according to their deeds;
\par 36 And have mercy on the righteous, delivering him from the affliction of the sinner,
\par  And recompensing the sinner for what he bath done to the righteous.
\par 37 For the Lord is good to them that call upon Him in patience,
\par  Doing according to His mercy to His pious ones,
\par  Establishing them at all times before Him in strength.
\par 38 Blessed be the Lord for ever before His servants.

\chapter{3}

\par \textit{Righteousness versus Sin.}

\par 1 Why sleepest thou, O my soul,
\par  And blessest not the Lord?
\par 2 Sing a new song,
\par  Unto God who is worthy to be praised.
\par 3 Sing and be wakeful against His awaking,
\par  For good is a psalm sung to God from a glad heart.
\par    
\par 4 The righteous remember the Lord at all times,
\par  With thanksgiving and declaration of the righteousness of the Lord's judgements.
\par 5 The righteous despiseth not the chastening of the Lord;
\par  His will is always before the Lord.
\par 6 The righteous stumbleth and holdeth the Lord righteous:
\par  He falleth and looketh out for what God will do to him;
\par 7 He seeketh out whence his deliverance will come.
\par  The steadfastness of the righteous is from God, their deliverer;
\par 8 There lodgeth not in the house of the righteous sin upon sin.
\par  The righteous continually searcheth his house,
\par 9To remove utterly all iniquity done by him in error.
\par  He maketh atonement for sins of ignorance by fasting and afflicting his soul,
\par 10 And the Lord counteth guiltless every pious man and his house. p. 108
\par  The sinner stumbleth and curseth his life
\par 11 The day when he was begotten, and his mother's travail.
\par  He addeth sins to sins, while he liveth;
\par 12 He falleth—verily grievous is his fall—and riseth no more.
\par  The destruction of the sinner is for ever,
\par 13 And he shall not be remembered, when the righteous is visited.
\par  This is the portion of sinners for ever.
\par    
\par 14 But they that fear the Lord shall rise to life eternal,
\par  And their life shall be in the light of the Lord, and shall come to an end no more.

\chapter{4}

\par \textit{A conversation of Solomon with the Men-pleasers.}

\par 1 Wherefore sittest thou, O profane man, in the council of the pious,
\par  Seeing that thy heart is far removed from the Lord,
\par  Provoking with transgressions the God of Israel?
\par 2 Extravagant in speech, extravagant in outward seeming beyond all men,
\par  Is he that is severe of speech in condemning sinners in judgement.
\par 3 And his hand is first upon him as though he acted in zeal,
\par  And yet he is himself guilty in respect of manifold sins and of wantonness.
\par 4 His eyes are upon every woman without distinction;
\par  His tongue lieth when he maketh contract with an oath.
\par 5 By night and in secret he sinneth as though unseen,
\par  With his eyes he talketh to every woman of evil compacts.
\par 6 He is swift to enter every house with cheerfulness as though guileless.
\par    
\par 7 Let God remove those that live in hypocrisy in the company of the pious,
\par  Even the life of such an one with corruption of his flesh and penury.
\par 8 Let God reveal the deeds of the men-pleasers,
\par  The deeds of such an one with laughter and derision;
\par 9 That the pious may count righteous the judgement of their God,
\par  When sinners are removed from before the righteous,
\par  Even the man-pleaser who uttereth law guilefully.
\par 10 And their eyes are fixed upon any man's house that is still secure,
\par  That they may, like the Serpent, destroy the wisdom of . . . with words of transgressors,
\par 11 His words are deceitful that he may accomplish his wicked desire.
\par  He never ceaseth from scattering families as though they were orphans,
\par  Yea, he layeth waste a house on account of his lawless desire.
\par 12 He deceiveth with words, saying, There is none that seeth, or judgeth.
\par 13 He fills one house with lawlessness,
\par  And then his eyes are fixed upon the next house,
\par  To destroy it with words that give wing to desire.
\par 14 Yet with all these his soul like Sheol, is not sated.
\par    
\par 15 Let his portion, O Lord, be dishonoured before thee;
\par  Let him go forth groaning, and come home cursed.
\par 16 Let his life be spent in anguish, and penury, and want, O Lord; p. 109
\par  Let his sleep be beset with pains and his awaking with perplexities.
\par 17 Let sleep be withdrawn from his eyelids at night;
\par  Let him fail dishonourably in every work of his hands.
\par 18 Let him come home empty-handed to his house,
\par  And his house be void of everything wherewith he could sate his appetite.
\par 19 Let his old age be spent in childless loneliness until his removal by death.
\par    
\par 20 Let the flesh of the men-pleasers be rent by wild beasts,
\par  And let the bones of the lawless lie dishonoured in the sight of the sun.
\par 21 Let ravens peck out the eyes of the hypocrites.
\par 22 For they have laid waste many houses of men, in dishonour,
\par  And scattered them in their lust;
\par 23 And they have not remembered God,
\par  Nor feared God in all these things;
\par  But they have provoked God's anger and vexed Him.
\par 24 May He remove them from off the earth,
\par  Because with deceit they beguiled the souls of the flawless.
\par    
\par 25 Blessed are they that fear the Lord in their flawlessness;
\par  The Lord shall deliver them from guileful men and sinners,
\par  And deliver us from every stumbling-block of the lawless (men).
\par 26 Let God destroy them that insolently work all unrighteousness,
\par  For a great and mighty judge is the Lord our God in righteousness.
\par    
\par 27 Let Thy mercy, O Lord, be upon all them that love Thee.

\chapter{5}

\par \textit{A statement of the philosophy of the indestructibility of matter. One of the tenets of modern physics.}

\par 1 O Lord God, I will praise Thy name with joy,
\par  In the midst of them that know Thy righteous judgements.
\par 2 For Thou art good and merciful, the refuge of the poor;
\par  When I cry to Thee, do not silently disregard me.
\par 3 For no man taketh spoil from a mighty man;
\par  Who, then, can take aught of a that Thou hast made, except Thou Thyself givest?
\par 4 For man and his portion lie before Thee in the balance;
\par  He cannot add to, so as to enlarge, what has been prescribed by Thee.
\par    
\par 5 O God, when we are in distress we call upon Thee for help,
\par  And Thou dost not turn back our petition, for Thou art our God.
\par 6 Cause not Thy hand to be heavy upon us,
\par  Lest through necessity we sin.
\par 7 Even though Thou restore us not, we will not keep away;
\par  But unto Thee will we come.
\par 8 For if I hunger, unto Thee will I cry, O God;
\par  And Thou wilt give to me.
\par    
\par 9 Birds and fish dost Thou nourish,
\par  In that Thou givest rain to the steppes that green grass may spring up,
\par  So to prepare fodder in the steppe for every living thing;
\par 10 And if they hunger, unto Thee do they lift up their face.
\par 11 Kings and rulers and peoples Thou dost nourish, O God;
\par  And who is the help of the poor and needy, if not Thou, O Lord? p. 110
\par 12 And Thou wilt hearken—for who is good and gentle but thou?—
\par  Making glad the soul of the humble by opening Thine hand in mercy.
\par    
\par 13 Man's goodness is bestowed grudgingly and ...;
\par  And if he repeat it without murmuring, even that is marvellous.
\par 14 But Thy gift is great in goodness and wealth,
\par  And he whose hope is set on Thee shall have no lack of gifts.
\par 15 Upon the whole earth is Thy mercy, O Lord, in goodness.
\par    
\par 16 Happy is he whom God remembereth in granting to him a due sufficiency;
\par  If a man abound overmuch, he sinneth.
\par 17 Sufficient are moderate means with righteousness,
\par  And hereby the blessing of the Lord becomes abundance with righteousness.
\par 18 They that fear the Lord rejoice in good gifts,
\par  And thy goodness is upon Israel in Thy kingdom.
\par    
\par 19 Blessed is the glory of the Lord, for He is our king.



\chapter{6}

\par \textit{A song of hope and fearlessness and peace.}

\par 1 Happy is the man whose heart is fixed to call upon the name of the Lord;
\par  When he remembereth the name of the Lord, he will be saved.
\par 2 His ways are made even by the Lord,
\par  And the works of his hands are preserved by the Lord his God.
\par 3 At what he sees in his bad dreams, his soul shall not be troubled;
\par  When he passes through rivers and the tossing of the seas, he shall not be dismayed.
\par 4 He ariseth from his sleep, and blesseth the name of the Lord:
\par  When his heart is at peace, he singeth to the name of his God,
\par  And he entreateth the Lord for all his house.
\par 5 And the Lord heareth the prayer of every one that feareth God,
\par  And every request of the soul that hopes for Him doth the Lord accomplish.
\par    
\par 6 Blessed is the Lord, who showeth mercy to those who love Him in sincerity.

\chapter{7}

\par \textit{The fine old doctrine—“Thou art our Shield!”}

\par 1 Make not Thy dwelling afar from us, O God;
\par  Lest they assail us that hate us without cause.
\par 2 For Thou hast rejected them, O God;
\par  Let not their foot trample upon Thy holy inheritance.
\par 3 Chasten us Thyself in Thy good pleasure;
\par  But give us not up to the nations;
\par 4 For, if Thou sendest pestilence,
\par  Thou Thyself givest it charge concerning us;
\par 5 For Thou art merciful,
\par  And wilt not be angry to the point of consuming us.
\par    
\par 6 While Thy name dwelleth in our midst, we shall find mercy;
\par  And the nations shall not prevail against us.
\par 7 For Thou art our shield,
\par  And when we call upon Thee, Thou hearkenest to us;
\par 8 For Thou wilt pity the seed of Israel for ever
\par  And Thou wilt not reject them: p. 111
\par 9 But we shall, be under Thy yoke for ever,
\par  And under the rod of Thy chastening.
\par 10 Thou wilt establish us in the time that Thou helpest us,
\par  Showing mercy to the house of Jacob on the day wherein Thou didst promise to help them.

\chapter{8}

\par \textit{Some remarkable similes of war creeping on Jerusalem. A survey of the sins that brought all this trouble.}

\par 1 Distress and the sound of war hath my ear heard,
\par  The sound of a trumpet announcing slaughter and calamity,
\par 2 The sound of much people as of an exceeding high wind,
\par  As a tempest with mighty fire sweeping through the Negeb.
\par 3 And I said in my heart, Surely God judgeth us;
\par  A sound I hear moving towards Jerusalem, the holy city
\par 4 My loins were broken at what I heard, my knees tottered;
\par  My heart was afraid, my bones were dismayed like flax.
\par 5 I said: They establish their ways in righteousness.
\par    
\par 6 I thought upon the judgments of God since the creation of heaven and earth;
\par  I held God righteous in His judgements which have been from of old.
\par 7 God bare their sins in the full light of day;
\par  All the earth came to know the righteous judgements of God.
\par 8 In secret places underground their iniquities were committed to provoke Him to anger;
\par 9 They wrought confusion, son with mother and father with daughter;
\par  They committed adultery, every man with his neighhour's wife.
\par 10 They concluded covenants with one another with an oath touching these things;
\par  They plundered the sanctuary of God, as though there was no avenger.
\par 11 They trode the altar of the Lord, coming straight from all manner of uncleanness;
\par  And with menstrual blood they defiled the sacrifices, as though these were common flesh.
\par 12 They left no sin undone, wherein they surpassed not the heathen.
\par    
\par 13 Therefore God mingled for them a spirit of wandering;
\par  And gave them to drink a cup of undiluted wine, that they might become drunken.
\par 14 He brought him that is from the end of the earth, that smiteth mightily;
\par  He decreed war against Jerusalem, and against her land.
\par 15 The princes of the land went to meet him with joy: they said unto him:
\par  Blessed be thy way! Come ye, enter ye in with peace.
\par 16 They made the rough ways even, before his entering in;
\par  They opened the gates to Jerusalem, they crowned its walls.
\par    
\par 17 As a father entereth the house of his sons, so he entered Jerusalem in peace;
\par  He established his feet there in great safety.
\par 18 He captured her fortresses and the wall of Jerusalem;
\par  For God Himself led him in safety, while they wandered.
\par 19 He destroyed their princes and every one wise in counsel;
\par  He poured out the blood of the inhabitants of Jerusalem, like the water of uncleanness. p. 112
\par 20 He led away their sons and daughters, whom they had begotten in defilement.
\par    
\par 21 They did according to their uncleanness, even as their fathers had done:
\par  They defiled Jerusalem and the things that had been hallowed to the name of God.
\par 22 But God hath shown Himself righteous in His judgements upon the nations of the earth;
\par  And the pious servants of God are like innocent lambs in their midst.
\par 23 Worthy to be praised is the Lord that judgeth the whole earth in His righteousness.
\par    
\par 24 Behold, now, O God, Thou hast shown us Thy judgement in Thy righteousness;
\par  Our eyes have seen Thy judgements, O God.
\par 25 We have justified Thy name that is honoured for ever;
\par  For Thou are the God of righteousness, judging Israel with chastening.
\par    
\par 26 Turn, O God, Thy mercy upon us, and have pity upon us;
\par  Gather together the dispersed of Israel, with mercy and goodness;
\par 27 For Thy faithfulness is with us,
\par 28 And though we have stiffened our neck, yet Thou art our chastener;
\par  Overlook us not, O our God, lest the nations swallow us up, as though there were none to deliver.
\par    
\par 29 But Thou art our God from the beginning,
\par  And upon Thee is our hope set, O Lord;
\par 30 And we will not depart from Thee,
\par  For good are Thy judgements upon us.
\par 31 Ours and our children's be Thy good pleasure for ever;
\par  O Lord, our Saviour, we shall never more be moved.
\par 32 The Lord is worthy to be praised for His judgements with the mouth of His pious ones;
\par  And blessed be Israel of the Lord for ever.

\chapter{9}

\par \textit{The exile of the tribes of Israel. A reference to the covenant which God made with Adam. (See the First Book of Adam and Eve, Chap. III, Verse 7).}

\par 1 When Israel was led away captive into a strange land,
\par  When they fell away from the Lord who redeemed them,
\par  They were cast away from the inheritance, which the Lord had given them.
\par 2 Among every nation were the dispersed of Israel according to the word of God,
\par  That Thou mightest be justified, O God, in Thy righteousness by reason of our transgressions:
\par  For Thou art a just judge over all the peoples of the earth.
\par 3 For from Thy knowledge none that doeth unjustly is hidden,
\par  And the righteous deeds of Thy pious ones are before Thee, O Lord;
\par  Where, then, can a man hide himself from Thy knowledge, O God?
\par 4 Our works are subject to our own choice and power
\par  To do right or wrong in the works of our hands;
\par  And in Thy righteousness Thou visitest the sons of men.
\par 5 He that doeth righteousness layeth up life for himself with the Lord;
\par  And he that doeth wrongly forfeits his life to destruction; p. 113
\par 6 For the judgements of the Lord are given in righteousness to every man and his house.
\par 7 Unto whom art Thou good, O God, except to them that call upon the Lord?
\par  He cleanseth from sins a soul when it maketh confession, when it maketh acknowledgement;
\par  For shame is upon us and u on our faces on account of all these things.
\par 8 And to whom doth He forgive sins, except to them that have sinned?
\par  Thou blessest the righteous, and dost not reprove them for the sins that they have committed;
\par  And Thy goodness is upon them that sin, when they repent.
\par 9 And, now, Thou art our God, and we the people whom Thou hast loved:
\par  Behold and show pity, O God of Israel, for we are Thine;
\par  And remove not Thy mercy from us, lest they assail us.
\par 10 For Thou didst choose the seed of Abraham before all the nations,
\par  And didst set Thy name upon us, O Lord,
\par  And Thou wilt not reject us for ever.
\par 11 Thou madest a covenant with our fathers concerning us;
\par  And we hope in Thee, when our soul turneth unto Thee.
\par  The mercy of the Lord be upon the house of Israel for ever and ever.

\chapter{10}

\par \textit{A glorious hymn. Further reference to the eternal covenant between God and Man.}

\par 1 Happy is the man whom the Lord remembereth with reproving,
\par  And whom He restraineth from the way of evil with strokes
\par  That he may be cleansed from sin, that it may not be multiplied.
\par 2 He that maketh ready his back for strokes shall be cleansed,
\par  For the Lord is good to them that endure chastening.
\par 3 For He maketh straight the ways of the righteous,
\par  And doth not pervert them by His chastening.
\par 4 And the mercy of the Lord is upon them that love Him in truth,
\par  And the Lord remembereth His servants in mercy.
\par 5 For the testimony is in the law of the eternal covenant,
\par  The testimony of the Lord is on the ways of men in His visitation.
\par 6 Just and kind is our Lord in His judgements for ever,
\par  And Israel shall praise the name of the Lord in gladness.
\par 7 And the pious shall give thanks in the assembly of the people;
\par  And on the poor shall God have mercy in the gladness of Israel;
\par 8 For good and merciful is God for ever,
\par  And the assemblies of Israel shall glorify the name of the Lord.
\par    
\par 9 The salvation of the Lord be upon the house of Israel unto everlasting gladness!

\chapter{11}

\par \textit{Jerusalem hears a trumpet and stands on tiptoe to see her children returning from the North, East and West.}

\par 1 Blow ye in Zion on the trumpet to summon the saints,
\par  Cause ye to be heard in Jerusalem the voice of him that bringeth good tidings; p. 114
\par  For God hath had pity on Israel in visiting them.
\par 2 Stand on the height, O Jerusalem, and behold thy children,
\par  From the East and the West, gathered together by the Lord;
\par 3 From the North they come in the gladness of their God,
\par  From the isles afar off God hath gathered them.
\par 4 High mountains hath He abased into a plain for them;
\par  The hills fled at their entrance.
\par 5 The woods gave them shelter as they passed by;
\par  Every sweet-smelling tree God caused to spring up for them,
\par  That Israel might pass by in the visitation of the glory of their God.
\par 6 Put on, O Jerusalem, thy glorious garments;
\par  Make ready thy holy robe;
\par  For God hath spoken good concerning Israel, for ever and ever.
\par 7 Let the Lord do what He hath spoken concerning Israel and Jerusalem;
\par  Let the Lord raise up Israel by His glorious name.
\par    
\par 8 The mercy of the Lord be upon Israel for ever and ever.



\chapter{12}

\par \textit{An appeal for family tranquility and peace and quiet at home.}

\par 1 O Lord, deliver my soul from the lawless and wicked man,
\par  From the tongue that is lawless and slanderous, and speaketh lies and deceit.
\par 2 Manifoldly twisted are the words of the tongue of the wicked man,
\par  Even as among a people a fire that burneth up their beauty.
\par 3 So he delights to fill houses with a lying tongue,
\par  To cut down the trees of gladness which setteth on fire transgressors,
\par  To involve households in warfare by means of slanderous lips.
\par    
\par 4 May God remove far from the innocent the lips of transgressors by bringing them to want
\par  And may the bones of slanderers be scattered far away from them that fear the Lord!
\par  In flaming fire perish the slanderous tongue far away from the pious!
\par 5 May the Lord preserve the quiet soul that hateth the unrighteous;
\par  And may the Lord establish the man that followeth peace at home.
\par 6 The salvation of the Lord be upon Israel His servant for ever;
\par  And let the sinners perish together at the presence of the Lord;
\par  But let the Lord's pious ones inherit the promises of the Lord.

\chapter{13}

\par \textit{Of Solomon. A Psalm. Comfort for the righteous.}

\par 1 The right hand of the Lord hath covered me;
\par  The right hand of the Lord hath spared us.
\par 2 The arm of the Lord hath saved us from the sword that passed through,
\par  From famine and the death of sinners.
\par 3 Noisome beasts ran upon them:
\par  With their teeth they tore their flesh,
\par  And with their molars crushed their bones.
\par 4 But from all these things the Lord delivered us. p. 115
\par 5 The righteous was troubled on account of his errors,
\par  Lest he should be taken away along with the sinners;
\par 6 For terrible is the overthrow of the sinner;
\par  But not one of all these things toucheth the righteous.
\par 7 For not alike are the chastening of the righteous for sins done in ignorance,
\par  And the overthrow of the sinners.
\par 8 Secretly is the righteous chastened,
\par  Lest the sinner rejoice over the righteous.
\par 9 For He correcteth the righteous as a beloved son.
\par  And his chastisement is as that of a first-born.
\par 10 For the Lord spareth His pious ones,
\par  And blotteth out their errors by His chastening.
\par 11 For the life of the righteous shall be for ever;
\par  But sinners shall be taken away into destruction,,
\par  And their memorial shall be found no more.
\par 12 But upon the pious is the mercy of the Lord,
\par  And upon them that fear Him His mercy.



\chapter{14}

\par \textit{Sinners “love the brief day spent in companionship with their sin.” Profound wisdom, beautifully expressed.}

\par 1 Faithful is the Lord to them that love Him in truth,
\par  To them that endure His chastening,
\par 2 To them that walk in the righteousness of His commandments,
\par  In the law which He commanded us that we might live.
\par 3 The pious of the Lord shall live by it for ever;
\par  The Paradise of the Lord, the trees of life, are His pious ones.
\par 4 Their planting is rooted for ever;
\par  They shall not be plucked up all the days of heaven:
\par 5 For the portion and the inheritance of God is Israel.
\par 6 But not so are the sinners and transgressors,
\par  Who love the brief day spent in companionship with their sin;
\par 7 Their delight is in fleeting corruption,
\par  And they remember not God.
\par 8 For the ways of men are known before Him at all times,
\par  And He knoweth the secrets of the heart before they come to pass.
\par 9 Therefore their inheritance is Sheol and darkness and destruction
\par  And they shall not be found in the day when the righteous obtain mercy;
\par 10 But the pious of the Lord shall inherit life in gladness.

\chapter{15}

\par \textit{The psalmist restates the great philosophy of Right and Wrong.}

\par 1 When I was in distress I called upon the name of the Lord,
\par  I hoped for the help of the God of Jacob and was saved;
\par  For the hope and refuge of the poor art Thou, O God.
\par 2 For who, O God, is strong except to give thanks unto Thee in truth?
\par  And wherein is a man powerful except in giving thanks to Thy name?
\par 3 A new psalm with song in gladness of heart,
\par  The fruit of the lips with the well-tuned instrument of the tongue,
\par  The first fruits of the lips from a pious and righteous heart— p. 116
\par 4 He that offereth these things shall never be shaken by evil;
\par  The flame of fire and the wrath against the unrighteous shall not touch him,
\par 5 When it goeth forth from the face of the Lord against sinners,
\par  To destroy all the substance of sinners,
\par 6 For the mark of God is upon the righteous that they may be saved.
\par    
\par 7 Famine and sword and pestilence shall be far from the righteous,
\par  For they shall flee away from the pious as men pursued in war;
\par 8 But they shall pursue sinners and overtake them,
\par  And they that do lawlessness shall not escape the judgement of God;
\par 9 As by enemies experienced in war shall they be overtaken,
\par  For the mark of destruction is upon their forehead.
\par 10 And the inheritance of sinners is destruction and darkness,
\par  And their iniquities shall pursue them unto Sheol beneath.
\par 11 Their inheritance shall not be found of their children,
\par  For sins shall lay waste the houses of sinners.
\par 12 And sinners shall perish for ever in the day of the Lord's judgement,
\par  When God visiteth the earth with His judgement.
\par 13 But they that fear the Lord shall find mercy therein,
\par  And shall live by the compassion of their God;
\par 14 But sinners shall perish for ever.



\chapter{16}

\par \textit{The psalmist again expresses profound truth—“For if Thou givest not strength, who can endure chastisement?”}

\par 1 When my soul slumbered being afar from the Lord, I had all but slipped down to the pit,
\par  When I was far from God, my soul had been well-nigh poured out unto death,
\par 2 I had been nigh unto the gates of Sheol with the sinner,
\par  When my soul departed from the Lord God of Israel—
\par 3 Had not the Lord helped me with His everlasting mercy.
\par    
\par 4 He pricked me, as a horse is pricked, that I might serve Him,
\par  My saviour and helper at all times saved me.
\par 5 I will give thanks unto Thee, O God, for Thou hast helped me to my salvation;
\par  And hast not counted me with sinners to my destruction.
\par 6 Remove not Thy mercy from me, O God,
\par  Nor Thy memorial from my heart until I die.
\par 7 Rule me, O God, keeping me back from wicked sin,
\par  And from every wicked woman that causeth the simple to stumble.
\par 8 And let not the beauty of a lawless woman beguile me,
\par  Nor any one that is subject to unprofitable sin.
\par    
\par 9 Establish the works of my hands before Thee,
\par  And preserve my goings in the remembrance of Thee.
\par 10 Protect my tongue and my lips with words of truth;
\par  Anger and unreasoning wrath put far from me.
\par 11 Murmuring, and impatience in affliction, remove far from me
\par  When, if I sin, Thou chastenest me that I may return unto Thee.
\par 12 But with goodwill and cheerfulness support my soul;
\par  When Thou strengthenest my soul, what is given to me will be sufficient for me.
\par 13 For if Thou givest not strength,
\par 14 Who can endure chastisement with poverty? p. 117
\par 15 When a man is rebuked by means of his corruption,
\par  Thy testing of him is in his flesh and in the affliction of poverty.
\par 16 If the righteous endureth in all these trials, he shall receive mercy from the Lord.

\chapter{17}

\par \textit{“They set a worldly monarchy . . . . they lay waste the Throne of David!” A poetic narrative about the utter disintegration of a great nation.}

\par 17 O Lord, Thou art our King for ever and ever,
\par  For in Thee, O God, doth our soul glory.
\par 18 How long are the days of man's life upon the earth?
\par  As are his days, so is the hope set upon him.
\par 19 But we hope in God, our deliverer;
\par 20 For the might of our God is for ever with mercy,
\par  And the kingdom of our God is for ever over the nations in judgement.
\par    
\par 21 Thou, O Lord, didst choose David to be king over Israel,
\par  And swaredst to him touching his seed that never should his kingdom fail before Thee.
\par 22 But, for our sins, sinners rose up against us;
\par  They assailed us and thrust us out;
\par  What Thou hadst not promised to them, they took away from us with violence.
\par 23 They in no wise glorified Thy honourable name;
\par  They set a worldly monarchy in place of that which was their excellency;
\par  They laid waste the throne of David in tumultuous arrogance.
\par 24 But Thou, O God, didst cast them down, and remove their seed from the earth,
\par  In that there rose up against them a man that was alien to our race.
\par 25 According to their sins didst Thou recompense them, O God;
\par  So that it befell them according to their deeds.
\par 26 God showed them no pity;
\par  He sought out their seed and let not one of them go free.
\par 27 Faithful is the Lord in all His judgements
\par  Which He doeth upon the earth.
\par    
\par 28 The lawless one laid waste our land so that none inhabited it,
\par  They destroyed young and old and their children together.
\par 29 In the heat of His anger He sent them away even unto the west,
\par  And He exposed the rulers of the land unsparingly to derision.
\par 30 Being an alien the enemy acted proudly,
\par  And his heart was alien from Our God.
\par 31 And all things whatsoever he did in Jerusalem,
\par  As also the nations in the cities to their gods.
\par    
\par 32 And the children of the covenant in the midst of the mingled peoples surpassed them in evil.
\par  There was not among them one that wrought in the midst of Jerusalem mercy and truth.
\par 33 They that loved the synagogues of the pious fled from them,
\par  As sparrows that fly from their nest.
\par 34 They wandered in deserts that their lives might be saved from harm, p. 118
\par  And precious in the eyes of them that lived abroad was any that escaped alive from them.
\par  Over the whole earth were they scattered by lawless men.
\par 35 For the heavens withheld the rain from dropping upon the earth,
\par  Springs were stopped that sprang perennially out of the deeps, that ran down from lofty mountains.
\par 36 For there was none among them that wrought righteousness and justice;
\par  From the chief of them to the least of them all were sinful;
\par  The king was a transgressor, and the judge disobedient, and the people sinful.
\par 37 Behold, O Lord, and raise up unto them their king, the son of David,
\par  At the time in the which Thou seest, O God, that he may reign over Israel Thy servant.
\par 38 And gird him with strength, that he may shatter unrighteous rulers,
\par  And that he may purge Jerusalem from nations that trample her down to destruction.
\par 39 Wisely, righteously he shall thrust out sinners from the inheritance,
\par  He shall destroy the pride of the sinner as a potter's vessel.
\par 40 With a rod of iron he shall break in pieces all their substance,
\par  He shall destroy the godless nations with the word of his mouth;
\par 41 At his rebuke nations shall flee before him,
\par  And he shall reprove sinners for the thoughts of their heart.
\par    
\par 42 And he shall gather together a holy people, whom he shall lead in righteousness,
\par  And he shall judge the tribes of the people that has been sanctified by the Lord his God.
\par 43 And he shall not suffer unrighteousness to lodge any more in their midst,
\par  Nor shall there dwell with them any man that knoweth wickedness,
\par  For he shall know them, that they are all sons of their God.
\par 44 And he shall divide them according to their tribes upon the land,
\par  And neither sojourner nor alien shall sojourn with them any more.
\par 45 He shall judge peoples and nations in the wisdom of his righteousness. Selah.
\par    
\par 46 And he shall have the heathen nations to serve him under his yoke;
\par  And he shall glorify the Lord in a place to be seen of all the earth;
\par  And he shall purge Jerusalem, making it holy as of old:
\par 47 So that nations shall come from the ends of the earth to see his glory,
\par  Bringing as gifts her sons who had fainted.
\par  And to see the glory of the Lord, wherewith God hath glorified her.
\par 48 And he shall be a righteous king, taught of God, over them,
\par 49 And there shall be no unrighteousness in his days in their midst,
\par  For all shall be holy and their king the anointed of the Lord.
\par 50 For he shall not put his trust in horse and rider and bow,
\par  Nor shall he multiply for himself gold and silver for war,
\par    
\par 51 Nor shall he gather confidence from a multitude for the day of battle. p. 119
\par 52 The Lord Himself is his king, the hope of him that is mighty through his hope in God.
\par    
\par 53 All nations shall be in fear before him,
\par  For he will smite the earth with the word of his mouth for ever.
\par 54 He will bless the people of the Lord with wisdom and gladness,
\par  And he himself will be pure from sin, so that he may rule a great people.
\par 55 He will rebuke rulers, and remove sinners by the might of his word;
\par  And relying upon his God, throughout his days he will not stumble;
\par 56 For God will make him mighty by means of His holy spirit,
\par  And wise by means of the spirit of understanding, with strength and righteousness.
\par 57 And the blessing of the Lord will be with him: he will be strong and stumble not;
\par  His hope will be in the Lord: who then can prevail against him?
\par 58 He will, be mighty in his works, and strong in the fear of God,
\par  He will be shepherding the flock of the Lord faithfully and righteously,
\par  And will suffer none among them to stumble in their pasture.
\par 59 He will lead them all aright,
\par  And there will be no pride among them that any among them should be oppressed.
\par 60 This will be the majesty of the king of Israel whom God knoweth;
\par  He will raise him up over the house of Israel to correct him.
\par 61 His words shall be more refined than costly gold, the choicest;
\par  In the assemblies he will judge the peoples, the tribes of the sanctified.
\par 62 His words shall be like the words of the holy ones in the midst of sanctified peoples.
\par 63 Blessed be they that shall be in those days,
\par  In that they shall see the good fortune of Israel which God shall bring to pass in the gathering together of the tribes.
\par 64 May the Lord hasten His mercy upon Israel!
\par  May He deliver us from the uncleanness of unholy enemies!
\par 65 The Lord Himself is our king for ever and ever.

\chapter{18}

\par \textit{With this psalm end the warlike Songs of Solomon.}

\par 1 Lord, Thy mercy is over the works of Thy hands for ever;
\par  Thy goodness is over Israel with a rich gift.
\par 2 Thine eyes look upon them, so that none of them suffers want;
\par  Thine ears listen to the hopeful prayer of the poor.
\par 3 Thy judgements are executed upon the whole earth in mercy;
\par  And Thy love is toward the seed of Abraham, the children of Israel.
\par 4 Thy chastisement is upon us as upon a first-born, only-begotten son,
\par  To turn back the obedient soul from folly that is wrought in ignorance.
\par 5 May God cleanse Israel against the day of mercy and blessing,
\par  Against the day of choice when
\par 6 Blessed shall they be that shall be in those days,
\par  He bringeth back His anointed. p. 120
\par 7 In that they shall see the goodness of the Lord which He shall perform for the generation that is to come,
\par 8 Under the rod of chastening of the Lord's anointed in the fear of his God,
\par  In the spirit of wisdom and righteousness and strength;
\par 9 That he may direct every man in the works of righteousness by the fear of God,
\par  That he may establish them all before the Lord,
\par  A good generation living in the fear of God in the days of mercy. Selah.
\par    
\par 10 Great is our God and glorious, dwelling in the highest.
\par 11 It is He who hath established in their courses the lights of heaven for determining seasons from year to year,
\par  And they have not turned aside from the way which He appointed them.
\par 12 In the fear of God they pursue their path every day,
\par  From the day God created them and for evermore.
\par 13 And they have erred not since the day He created them.
\par  Since the generations of old they have not withdrawn from their path,
\par  Unless God commanded them so to do by the command of His servants.
