\title{Psalm 151}

\chapter{1}

\par 1 I was small among my brothers, 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and the youngest in my father's house; 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I tended my father's sheep.
\par 2 My hands made a harp, 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; my fingers fashioned a lyre.
\par 3 And who will declare it to my Lord? 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Lord himself; it is he who hears.
\par 4 It was he who sent his messenger 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and took me from my father's sheep, 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and anointed me with his anointing oil.
\par 5 My brothers were handsome and tall, 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; but the Lord was not pleased with them.
\par 6 I went out to meet the Philistine, 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and he cursed me by his idols.
\par 7 But I drew his own sword; 
\par &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I beheaded him, and removed reproach from the people of Israel.
