\title{Prayer of Azariah}


\chapter{1}

\par 1 And they walked in the midst of the fire, praising God, and blessing the Lord.
\par 2 Then Azarias stood up, and prayed on this manner; and opening his mouth in the midst of the fire said,
\par 3 Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: thy name is worthy to be praised and glorified for evermore:
\par 4 For thou art righteous in all the things that thou hast done to us: yea, true are all thy works, thy ways are right, and all thy judgments truth.
\par 5 In all the things that thou hast brought upon us, and upon the holy city of our fathers, even Jerusalem, thou hast executed true judgment: for according to truth and judgment didst thou bring all these things upon us because of our sins.
\par 6 For we have sinned and committed iniquity, departing from thee.
\par 7 In all things have we trespassed, and not obeyed thy commandments, nor kept them, neither done as thou hast commanded us, that it might go well with us.
\par 8 Wherefore all that thou hast brought upon us, and every thing that thou hast done to us, thou hast done in true judgment.
\par 9 And thou didst deliver us into the hands of lawless enemies, most hateful forsakers of God, and to an unjust king, and the most wicked in all the world.
\par 10 And now we cannot open our mouths, we are become a shame and reproach to thy servants; and to them that worship thee.
\par 11 Yet deliver us not up wholly, for thy name's sake, neither disannul thou thy covenant:
\par 12 And cause not thy mercy to depart from us, for thy beloved Abraham's sake, for thy servant Issac's sake, and for thy holy Israel's sake;
\par 13 To whom thou hast spoken and promised, that thou wouldest multiply their seed as the stars of heaven, and as the sand that lieth upon the seashore.
\par 14 For we, O Lord, are become less than any nation, and be kept under this day in all the world because of our sins.
\par 15 Neither is there at this time prince, or prophet, or leader, or burnt offering, or sacrifice, or oblation, or incense, or place to sacrifice before thee, and to find mercy.
\par 16 Nevertheless in a contrite heart and an humble spirit let us be accepted.
\par 17 Like as in the burnt offerings of rams and bullocks, and like as in ten thousands of fat lambs: so let our sacrifice be in thy sight this day, and grant that we may wholly go after thee: for they shall not be confounded that put their trust in thee.
\par 18 And now we follow thee with all our heart, we fear thee, and seek thy face.
\par 19 Put us not to shame: but deal with us after thy lovingkindness, and according to the multitude of thy mercies.
\par 20 Deliver us also according to thy marvellous works, and give glory to thy name, O Lord: and let all them that do thy servants hurt be ashamed;
\par 21 And let them be confounded in all their power and might, and let their strength be broken;
\par 22 And let them know that thou art God, the only God, and glorious over the whole world.
\par 23 And the king's servants, that put them in, ceased not to make the oven hot with rosin, pitch, tow, and small wood;
\par 24 So that the flame streamed forth above the furnace forty and nine cubits.
\par 25 And it passed through, and burned those Chaldeans it found about the furnace.
\par 26 But the angel of the Lord came down into the oven together with Azarias and his fellows, and smote the flame of the fire out of the oven;
\par 27 And made the midst of the furnace as it had been a moist whistling wind, so that the fire touched them not at all, neither hurt nor troubled them.
\par 28 Then the three, as out of one mouth, praised, glorified, and blessed, God in the furnace, saying,
\par 29 Blessed art thou, O Lord God of our fathers: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
\par 30 And blessed is thy glorious and holy name: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
\par 31 Blessed art thou in the temple of thine holy glory: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.
\par 32 Blessed art thou that beholdest the depths, and sittest upon the cherubims: and to be praised and exalted above all for ever.
\par 33 Blessed art thou on the glorious throne of thy kingdom: and to be praised and glorified above all for ever.
\par 34 Blessed art thou in the firmament of heaven: and above ail to be praised and glorified for ever.
