\title{Greek Apocalypse of Ezra}

\chapter{1}

\par \textit{Introduction and prayer}

\par 1 It came to pass in the thirtieth year on the twenty-second of the month, 

\par 2 I was in my house and I cried out, saying to the Most High, “Lord, grant (me) glory so that I may see your mysteries.”


\par 3 When night fell the angel Michael, the archangel, came and said to me, “Prophet Ezra, lay aside bread for seventy weeks.” And I fasted just as he told me.

\par 4 And the archistrategos Raphael came and gave me a storax staff, 

\par 5 and I fasted twice sixty weeks, and I saw the mysteries of God and his angels.

\par 6 And I said to them, “I wish to plead with God concerning the Christian people. It were better that man were not born than that he entered the world.”

\par \textit{Ezra taken up to heaven: his prayer for mercy}

\par 7 Therefore, I was taken up into heaven and I saw in the first heaven a great command of angels and they led me to the judgments.

\par 8 And I heard a voice saying to me, “Have pity upon us, Ezra elect of God.”

\par 9 Then I began to say, “Woe to the sinners when they see the righteous man (elevated) above angels, and they are for fiery Gehenna.”

\par 10 And Ezra said, “Have pity upon the works of your hands, merciful and greatly pitying one.

\par 11 Condemn me rather than the souls of the sinners, for it is better to punish one soul and not to bring the whole world to destruction.”

\par 12 And God said, “I shall give rest to the righteous in Paradise and I am merciful.”

\par 13 And Ezra said, “Lord, Why do you show favor to the righteous?

\par 14 For as a hired man completes his time of service and goes away, and again a slave serves his masters in order to receive his wage, thus the righteous man receives his reward in the heavens. 

\par 15 But, have mercy upon the sinners for we know that you are merciful.”

\par 16 And God said, “I have no way to be merciful to them.” 

\par 17 And Ezra said, “(Be merciful) because they cannot sustain your anger.”

\par 18 And God said, “(I am wrathful) because such (are the deserts) of such (men) as these.”

\par 19 And God said, “I wish to keep you as both Paul and John.

\par 20 You have given me uncorrupted the inviolate treasury, the treasure of virginity, the wall of men.”

\par \textit{Ezra's second prayer}

\par 21 And Ezra said, “It were better if man were not born; it were well if he were not alive.

\par 22 The dumb beasts are a better thing than man, for they do not have punishment.

\par 23 You took us and delivered us to judgment. 

\par 24 Woe to the sinners in the world to come, for their condemnation is endless and the flame unquenched.”

\chapter{2}

\par \textit{Ezra remonstrates with God: the sin of Adam}

\par 1 As I said this to him, Michael and Gabriel and all the apostles came and said,

\par 2 “Greetings!” 

\par 3 [And Ezra said, “Faithful man of God!] 

\par 4 Arise and come hither with me, O Lord, to judgment.” And God said, “Behold I am giving you my covenant, both mine and yours, so that you will accept it.”

\par 5 And Ezra said, “We shall plead our case in your ear(s).”

\par 6 And God said, “Ask Abraham your father what kind of son presses suit against his father and come and plead the case with us.”

\par 7 And Ezra said, “As the Lord lives, I shall never cease pleading the case with you on account of the Christian people.

\par 8 Where are your former mercies, O Lord? Where your long-suffering?”

\par 9 And God said, “As I made night and day I made the righteous and the sinner and it were fitting to conduct yourself like the righteous man.”

\par 10 And the prophet said, “Who made Adam, the protoplast, the first one?”

\par 11 And God said, “My immaculate hands, and I placed him in Paradise to guard the region of the tree of life.”

\par 12 “Since he who established disobedience made this (man) sin.”

\par 13 And the prophet said, “Was he not guarded by an angel?

\par 14 And was life not preserved (by) the cherubim for the endless age?

\par 15 And how was he deceived who was guarded by angels (whom) you commanded to be present whatever happened? Attend also to that which I say!

\par 16 If you had not given him Eve, the serpent would never have deceived her.

\par 17 If you save whom you wish you will also destroy whom you wish.”

\par \textit{Ezra remonstrates with God: the sins of men}

\par 18 And the prophet said, “O my Lord, let us continue to a second judgment.”

\par 19 And God said, “I cast fire upon Sodom and Gomorrah.” 

\par 20 And the prophet said, “Lord, you bring upon us what we deserve.”

\par 21 And God said, “Your sins exceed my kindness.”

\par 22 And the prophet said, “Remember Scripture, my father, who measured out Jerusalem and rebuilt her.

\par 23 Pity, Lord, the sinners, pity your own molding, have mercy upon your works.”

\par 24 Then God remembered his works and said to the prophet, “How can I have mercy upon them?

\par 25 They gave vinegar and gall to drink and [...] they repented.”

\par \textit{The day of judgment}

\par 26 And the prophet said, “Reveal yourcherubiml and let us go togethertojudgment,

\par 27 and show me what is the character of the day of judgment.” 

\par 28 And God said, “You have digressed, Ezra,

\par 29 for such is the day of judgment upon which there is no rain on the earth,

\par 30 for is a merciful judgment during that day”. 

\par 31 And the prophet said, “I shall never cease to argue the case with you until I see the day of consummation.”

\par 32 (And God said,) “Count the stars and the sand of the sea and if you will be able to count this, you will also be able to argue the case with me.”

\chapter{3}

\par 1 And the prophet said, “Lord, you know that I bear human flesh. 

\par 2 And how can I count the stars of heaven and the sand of the sea?”

\par 3 And God said, “O my elect prophet, no man will know that great day and the manifestation which prevails to judge the world.

\par 4 For your sake, O my prophet, I told you the day, but the hour I told you not.”

\par 5 And the prophet said, “Lord, tell me also the years.” 

\par 6 And God said, “If I see that the justice of the world has become abundant, I will be long-suffering toward them. If not, I will stretch out my hand and I will grasp the inhabited world from its four corners and I will gather them all together to the valley of Jehosaphat and I will wipe out the human race and the world will be no more.”

\par 7 And the prophet said, “And how will your right hand be glorified?”

\par 8 And God said, “I will be glorified by my angels.”

\par \textit{Why was man created?}

\par 9 And the prophet said, “Lord, if this was your calculation, Why did you form man?

\par 10 You said to Abraham our father, ‘I will surely multiply your seed as the stars of the heaven and as the sand along the shore of the sea.’ And where is your promise?”

\par \textit{Signs of the end}

\par 11 And God said, “First I shall cause by shakingd the fall of four-footed beasts and men.

\par 12 And when you see that brother delivers brother over to death and children will rise up against parents and a wife abandons her own husband,

\par 13 and when nation will rise up against nation in war, then you shall know that the end is near.

\par 14 And then brother will not have mercy upon brother, nor man upon his wife, nor children upon parents, nor friends upon friends, nor slave upon master.

\par 15 For the opponent of men himself will come up from Tartarus and will show many things to men.

\par 16 What shall I do to you, Ezra, and will you argue the case with me?”

\chapter{4}

\par \textit{Ezra descends to Tartarus}

\par 1 And the prophet said, “Lord, I shall never cease arguing the case with you.”

\par 2 And God said, “Count the flowers of the earth. 

\par 3 If you can count them you also will be able to argue the case with me.”

\par 4 And the prophet said, “Lord, I cannot count them—I bear human flesh—but neither will I stop arguing the case with you.

\par 5 I wish, Lord, to see the lower parts of Tartarus.”

\par 6 And God said, “Go down and see!” 

\par 7 And he gave me Michael and Gabriel and thirty-four other angels,

\par 8 and I descended eighty-five steps and they led me down five hundred steps.

\par \textit{The punishment of Herod}

\par 9 And I saw a fiery throne and an old man seated on it, and his punishment was merciless.

\par 10 And I said to the angels, “Who is this and what is his sin?” 

\par 11 And they said to me, “This is Herod, who was king for a time, and he commanded to kill the infants two years old or under.”

\par 12 And I said, “Woe upon his soul!” 

\par \textit{The disobedient and the abyss}

\par 13 And again they led me down thirty steps. And I saw boiling fires there, and a multitude of sinners in them.

\par 14 And I heard their voices, but I did not perceive their forms.

\par 15 And they led me down deeper many steps which I was unable to count.

\par 16, And I saw old men there, and fiery axles were revolving upon their ears.

\par 17 And I said, “Who are these and what is their sin?”

\par 18 And they said to me, “These are the eavesdroppers.”

\par 19 And again they led me down five hundred Other steps. 

\par 20 And there I saw the unsleeping worm and fire consuming the sinners.

\par 21 And they led me down to the foundation of Apoleia (Destruction) and there I saw the twelvefold blow of the abyss.

\par 22 And they led me away to the south and there I saw a man hanging from his eyelids and the angels were beating him.

\par 23 And I asked, “Who is this and what is his sin?”

\par 24 And Michael the archistrategos said to me, “This man is incestuous; having carried out a small lust, this man was commanded to be hanged.”

\par \textit{The Antichrist}

\par 25 And they led me away to the north and I saw a man there restrained with iron bars.

\par 26 And I asked, “Who is this?” And he said to me, 

\par 27 “This is the one who says, ‘I am the son of God and he who made stones bread and water wine.’”

\par 28 And the prophet said, “Make known to me what sort of appearance he has and I will inform the race of men lest they believe in him.”

\par 29 And he said to me, “The appearance of his face is as of a wild man. His right eye is like a star rising at dawn and the other is unmoving.

\par 30 His mouth is one cubit, his teeth are a span long,

\par 31 his fingers like scythes, the soles of his feet two span, and on his forehead an inscription ‘Antichrist.’

\par 32 He was exalted up to heaven, he will descend as far

\par 33 as Hades. One time he will be a child, another an old man.” 

\par 34 And the prophet said, “Lord, how do you permit the race of men to stray?”

\par 35 And God said, “Hear, my prophet! He becomes a Child and an old man and let no one believe him that he is my beloved son.

\par 36 And after these things a trumpet, and the graves will be opened and the dead will rise up uncorrupted.

\par 37 Then the opponent, having heard the terrible threat, will hide himself in the outer darkness.

\par 38 Then the heaven and the earth and the sea will perish.

\par 39 Then I shall bum the heaven for eighty cubits and the earth for eight hundred cubits.”

\par 40 And the prophet said, “And (in) what did the heaven sin?”

\par 41 And God said, “Since [...] is the evil.” 

\par 42 And the prophet said, “Lord, (in) what did the earth sin?”

\par 43 And God said, “Since the opponent having heard my terrible threat will hide (in it), and because of that I shall melt the earth and with it the rebel of the race of men.”

\chapter{5}

\par \textit{Further punishments}

\par 1 And the prophet said, “Pity, O Lord, the race of Christians.” 

\par 2 And I saw a woman suspended and four wild beasts were sucking upon her breasts.

\par 3 And the angels said to me, “She begrudged giving her milk but also cast infants into the rivers.”

\par 4 And I saw terrible darkness and night without stars or moon. 

\par 5 There is there neither young nor old, neither brother with brother nor mother with Child nor wife with husband.

\par 6 And I wept and said, “O Lord, Lord, have mercy upon the sinners.”

\par \textit{Ezra taken to heaven}

\par 7 And as I said these things a cloudb came and seized me and took me up again to the heavens.

\par 8 And I saw many judgments and I wept bitterly and I said, 

\par 9 “It were better if man did not come forth from his mother's belly.”

\par 10 Those who were in punishment called out, saying, “Since you came here, holy one of God, we have obtained a slight respite.”

\par 11 And the prophet said, “Blessed are they who bewail their own sins.”

\par \textit{Birth and its purpose}

\par 12 And God said, “Hear Ezra, beloved one! Just as a farmer casts down the seed of corn into the earth, so a man casts down his seed into a woman's place.

\par 13 In the first (month) it is a whole, in the second it is swollen, in the third it grows hair, in the fourth it grows nails, in the fifth it becomes milky, in the sixth it is ready and quickened, in the seventh it is prepared, [in the eighth...], in the ninth the bars of the gateways of the woman are opened and it is born healthy on the earth.”

\par 14 And the prophet said, “It were better for man not to have been born. 

\par 15 Alas, O human race, at that time when you come to judgment!”

\par 16 And I said to the Lord, “Lord, Why did you create man and give him over to judgment?”

\par 17 And God said in his exalted pronouncement, “I will not pardon those who transgress my covenant.”

\par 18 And the prophet said, “Lord, where is your goodness?” 

\par 19 And God said, I prepared everything because of man and man does not keep my commandments.

\par \textit{Punishments and rewards}

\par 20 And the prophet said, “Lord, reveal to me the punishments and Paradise.”

\par 21 And the angels led me away to the eastf and I saw the tree of life.

\par 22 And I saw there Enoch and Elijah and Moses and Peter and Paul and Luke and Matthew and all the righteous and the patriarchs.

\par 23 And I saw there the rpunishmentl of the air and the blowing of the winds and the storehouses of the ice and the eternal punishments.

\par 24 And I saw there a man hanging by his skull. 

\par 25 And they said to me, “This one transferred boundaries.”

\par 26 And there I saw great judgments and said to the Lord, “O Lord, Lord, which of men, having been born, did not sin?”

\par 27 And they led me farther down in Tartarus and I saw all the sinners lamenting and weeping and evil mourning.

\par 28 And I too wept, seeing the race of rnen punished thus.

\chapter{6}

\par 1 Then God said to me, “Ezra, do you know the names of the angels who are over the consummation:

\par 2 Michael, Gabriel, Uriel, Raphael, Gabuthelon, Aker, Arphugitonos, Beburos, Zebuleon?”

\par \textit{Ezra struggles for his soul}

\par 3 Then a voice came to me, “Come here, die, Ezra, my beloved! Give back that which has been entrusted (to you).”

\par 4 And the prophet said, “And whence can you bring forth my soul?”

\par 5 And the angels said, “We can cast it forth through your mouth.”

\par 6 And the prophet said, “I spoke mouth to mouth with God and it will not go forth from there.”

\par 7 And the angels said. “We will bring it forth through your nostrils.”

\par 8 And the prophet said, “My nostrils smelled the glory of God.”"

\par 9 And the angels said, “We can bring it forth through your eyes.” 

\par 10 And the prophet said, “My eyes have seen the back of God.”

\par 11 And the angels said, “We can bring it forth through your head.”

\par 12 And the angels said, “We can bring it forth through your feet.” And the prophet said, “I walked with Moses on the mountain, and it will not come forth from there.”

\par 13 And the angels said, “We can cast it forth through the tips of your (toe)nails.”

\par 14 And the prophet said, “My feet walked in in the sanctuary.” 

\par 15 And the angels departed unsuccessful, saying, “Lord, we cannot receive his soul.”

\par 16 Then he said to his only begotten son, “Go down, my beloved son, with a numerous host of angels, taking the soul of my beloved Ezra.”

\par 17 For the Lord, having taken a numerous army of many angels, said to the prophet, “Give me that deposit which I entrusted to you. The crown is readied for you.”

\par 18 And the prophet said, “Lord, if you take my soul from me, who will you have left to plead on behalf of the race of men?”

\par 19 And God said, “You who are mortal and earthly, do not plead the case with me.”

\par 20 And the prophet said, “I shall never cease pleading.”

\par 21 And God said, “Give, in the meanwhile, that which is entrusted (to you). The crown is readied for you.

\par 22 Come here, die, so that you may attain it.”

\par 23 Then the prophet began to speak with tears, “O Lord, what profits it that I plead the case with you, and I am going to fall to the earth?

\par 24 Woe, woe! for I will be consumed by worms.

\par 25 Bewail me, all holy and pious ones, I plead greatly and

\par 26 am delivered over to death! Bewail me, all holy and just ones, because I have entered the bowl of Hades.”

\chapter{7}

\par \textit{Soul and body}

\par 1 And God said to him, “Hear, Ezra, my beloved one. I, being immortal, received a cross, I tasted vinegar and gall, I was set down in a grave.

\par 2 And I raised up my elect ones and I summoned up Adam from Hades so that the race of men

\par 3 [...]. Therefore, fear not death. For that which is from mes that is the soul, departs for heaven. That which is from the earth, that is the body, departs for the earth from which it was taken.”

\par 4 And the prophet said, “Woe, woe! What shall I do? How shall I act? I know not.”

\par \textit{Concluding prayerb}

\par 5 And then the blessed Ezra began to say, “O eternal God, Creator of the whole creation, who measured out the heaven with a span and contained the earth in his hand,

\par 6 who drives the cherubim, who took the prophet Elijah to the heavens in a fiery chariot,

\par 7 who gives nurture to all flesh, whom all things fear and tremble from the face of your power,

\par 8 hear me who pleads greatly 

\par 9 and give to all who copy this book and preserve it and recall my name and preserve my memory fully, give them blessing from heaven.

\par 10 And bless all of his things, just as the ends of Joseph.

\par 11 And remember not his previous sins on the day of his judgment. 

\par 12 Those who do not believe this book will be burned like Sodom and Gomorrah.” 

\par 13And a voice carne to him saying, “Ezra. my beloved, I shall grant to each one the things which you asked.”

\par \textit{Death and burial of Ezra}

\par 14 And at once he gave over his precious soul with much honor on the eighteenth of the month of October.

\par 15 And they buried him with incense and psalms. His precious and holy body provides unceasingly strengthening of souls and bodies for those who approach him willingly.

\par 16 Glory, might, honor, and worship to him for whom it is fitting, for the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, now and always and for ever and ever. Amen.
