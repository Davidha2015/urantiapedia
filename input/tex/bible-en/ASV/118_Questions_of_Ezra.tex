\title{Questions of Ezra}

\chapter{1}

\par \textit{Recension A}

\par \textit{What is the fate of the righteous and the sinners?}

\par 1 Ezra the prophet saw the angel of God and asked him one question after another.

\par 2 And the angel approached him and said what will be at the consummation. The prophet asked the angel and said, “What has God prepared for the righteous and the sinners? And at the time at which the day of the end arrives, what will become

\par 3 of them? Where do they go, to honor or to tortures?” The angel replied and said to the prophet, “Great joy and eternal light have been prepared for the righteous and for the sinners there have been prepared the outer darknessc and the eternal

\par 4 fire.” The prophet said to the angel, “Lord, who of the living has not sinned

\par 5 against God? And if that is so, then blessed are the beasts and the birds who do

\par 6 not await resurrection and have not expected the end. If you will crown the righteous, who have endured all tortures, and the prophets and the martyrs when they were taking stones and with a hammer were pounding their faces until their

\par 7 innards were seen, they were tortured for your sake. Have mercy upon us sinners who have been occupied and have been seized by Satan.”

\par \textit{The prophet rebuked}

\par 8 The angel replied and said, “If there is someone above you, do not talk with

\par 9 him anymore. otherwise great evil will befall you.” The prophet said to the angel,

\par 10 “Lord, I would speak a little more with you, reply to me! When the day of the end arrives and he takes the soul, will he assign it to the place of punishment or to the place of honor until the Parousia? [...]”

\par \textit{The day of the end}

\par 11 The angel replied and said, “Do not wait until the day of the end, but like a

\par 12 flying eagle hasten to do good deeds and mercy. For that day is fearsome, urgent,

\par 13 and exacting. It does not permit care of children or of possessions. lt comes and arrives suddenly like someone merciless and impartial, it takes a captive unexpectedly, surely. Whether he weeps or moums, it will have no mercy.”

\par \textit{The good and evil angels}

\par 14 “But when the day of the end arrives, a good angel comes to the good soul and an evil one to the evil. Just as someone sent by the kings to doers of evil deeds

\par 15 and good deeds recompenses good to the good and evil to the evil, even in the same way a good angel comes to the good soul and an evil one to the evil. Not

\par 16 that the angel is evil, but each (man's) deeds (are evil).i He takes the soul, brings it to the east; they pass through frost, through snow, through darkness, through hail, through ice, through storm, through hosts of Satan, through streams, through the winds of terrible rains, through terrible and astounding paths, through narrow

\par 17 defiles, and through high mountains. O wondrous way, for one foot is behind the

\par 18 Other and before it are fiery rivers!” The prophet was amazed and said, “O, that wondrous and terrible way!”

\par \textit{The seven steps to the Divinity}

\par 19 The angel said, “To that way there are seven camps and seven steps to the

\par 20 Divinity, if I can make (someone) pass along it. Because the first lodgings are bad and wondrous; the second fearsome and indescribable; the third hell and icy cold; the fourth quarrels and wers; in the fifth, then, investigation—if he is just, he shines, and if he is a sinner, he is darkened; in the Sixth, then, the soul of the

\par 21 righteous man sparkles like the sun; in the seventh, then, having brought (him) I make him approach the great throne of the Divinity, opposite the garden, facing the glory of Godtn where the sublime light is.”

\par \textit{God cannot be seen}

\par 22 The prophet said to the angel, “My lord, when you cause him to pass through such terrors, through quarrels, through wars, through burning heat, Why do you not cause him to meet the Divinity, rather than causing him to approach only the

\par 23 throne?” The angel said to the prophet, “You are one of the foolish men and you

\par 24 think according to human nature. I am an angel and I perpetually serve God, and I have not seen the face of God. How do you say that sinful man should be caused

\par 25 to meet the Divinity? For the Divinity is fearful and wondrous and who dares to

\par 26 look toward the uncreated Divinity? If a man should look he will melt like wax before the face of God: for the Divinity is fiery and wondrous. For such guardians stand around the throne of the Divinity.”

\par \textit{Those around the divine throne}

\par 27 “There are stations, [...] hollows, fiery ones, girdle wearers, (and) lanterns.

\par 28 At that place there are thunders, earthquakes, quarrels, wars, burning heat,o fire

\par 29 wearers, flame-swarming ones, (and) fiery hosts. Around him are incorporeal seraphim, six-winged cherubim: With two wings they cover their face, and with two wings their feet, and flying with two, they cry, ‘Holy, Holy, (Holy) Lord of

\par 30 Hosts, the heaven and earth are full of your glory’. Such guardians stand around the throne of the Divinity.”

\par \textit{Freeing of the soul from Satan}

\par 31 The prophet asked the angel and said, “Lord, what will become of us, for we are all sinners and seized in the hands of Satan? Now, by what means are we

\par 32 delivered or who will bring us forth from his hands?” The angel answered and said, “If someone remains after death, father or mother or brother or Sister or son or daughter or any Other Christian, and he offers prayers,q with fasts, for forty

\par 33 days, there will be great rest and mercy through the sacrifice of Christ. For Christ was sacrificed for our sake upon the cross and for Six ages he delivered (our) soul

\par 34 from the hands of Satan. How the soul is delivered through that offered reverently

\par 35 by a priest, if he fulfills the forty days in such a way as is pleasing to God!t For forty days he will remain in the church not going in the public places, but from

\par 36 time to time will recite the Psalms of David together with prayers. It is this which brings us forth from the hands of Satan. If not, give to the poor.”

\par \textit{The nature of prayer}

\par 37 “For your prayers are thus: just as a farmer goes forth, comes to sow, and the shoot comes forth joyous and graceful and desires to produce numerous fruit, and thorn and weeds also come forth and choke (it) and do not let numerous fruit be

\par 38 assembled. Similarly, also you, when you go inside the church and desire to offer prayers before the Divinity, the cares of this world and the deceit of greatness

\par 39 (wealth) come forth and choke you and do not let numerous fruit be sown. For if your prayer were such as Moses wept for forty days and spoke with God mouth


\par 40 to mouth, likewise also Elijah was taken up to heaven in a fiery chariot, likewise Daniel also pray[ed] in the li[on's] den ...”

\par \textit{(See Recension B, 10—14.)}

\chapter{2}

\par \textit{Recension B}

\par 1 He saw the angel of God and asked concerning the righteous and sinners when

\par 2 they go forth from this world. The angel said, “For the righteous there is light

\par 3 and rest, eternal life, but for the sinners, unending tortures”. Ezra said, “If that is so, then blessed are the animals and the beasts of the field and the creeping

\par 4 things and the birds of heaven who do not await resurrection and judgment.” The angel said, “You sin in saying this, for God has made every'thing for the sake of man and man for the sake of God. And those things in which God finds man, by

\par 5 those is he judged.” Ezra said, “When you take the souls of men, where will

\par 6 you bring them?” The angel said, “I bring the souls of the righteous to worship God and establish them in the upper atmosphere, and the souls of the sinners are

\par 7 seized by the demons who are imprisoned in the atmosphere.” And Ezra said,

\par 8 “And when will the soul which is seized by Satan be delivered?” The angel said, “Whent the soul has someone as a good memorial in this world, (this) one releases

\par 9 it from Satan through prayer and (acts of) mercy.” Ezra said, “By what means?” The angel said, “By prayer, by (acts of) mercy, and by sacrifices.” (Ezra said)

\par 10 “If the sinner's soul has no good memorial, which helps him, what will happen

\par 11 to him?” The angel said to him, “Such a one is in the hand of Satan until the

\par 12 coming of Christ, when the trumpet of Gabriel sounds. Then the souls are freed

\par 13 from the hands of Satan and soar down from the atmosphere. And they come and are united each with its body which had been retumed to dust and which the sound

\par 14 of the trumpet had built and aroused and renewed. And it raises (it) up before Christ our God who comes to judge (those on) the earth, that is the righteous and the wicked, and requites each for his deeds.” Through the petition of your divinely narrated prophets, have pity upon the readers of this writing.
