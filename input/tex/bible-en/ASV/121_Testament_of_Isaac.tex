\title{Testament of Isaac}

\chapter{1}

\par 1 In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, the One God. 

\par 2 We begin with the help of God and through his mediation to celebrate the death of the patriarch Isaac, son of the patriarch Abraham, and his ascension from his 

\par 3 body on this same day, which is the twenty-eighth of the month Misri. May the blessing of his intercession be with us and protect us from the temptations of the enemy! Amen! 

\par 4 [Now the patriarch Isaac wrote his testament and addressed his words of instruction to Jacob his son and all those who were gathered together with him. ]

\par 5 He said, “Hear, my brethren and my beloved ones, this speaker’s instruction and this curative medicine. 

\par 6 Because the way of God goes on forever, hear not only with chaste bodily ears, but also with the depth of the heart and with true faith without any doubt, as it is written, ‘Behold, you have heard a firm word as to what a man should become. If he has heard it with a pure heart, God will give him compassion when he asks for something from him.’” 

\par 7 “And it also is written, ‘There is no profit for someone to ask God for what  human beings solicit on earth.’ And if God has given us mastery on the earth, then how much the advantage of the one who has been firm in the faith in the word of God, and has held fast without doubt and with an upright heart to the knowledge of the commandments of God and the stories of his saints; for he will be the inheritor of the kingdom of God.” 

\par 8 “For behold, God is compassionate and merciful, the one who has received unto himself thieves and tax collectors in past times because of the sincerity of their faith that comes from God. And God, moreover, is with the ages to come.” 

\chapter{2}

\par 1 It came to pass, when the time drew near for our father Isaac, the father of fathers, to depart from this world and to go out from his body, that the Compassionate, the Merciful One sent to him the chief of the angels, Michael, the one whom he had sent to his father Abraham, on the morning of the twenty-eighth day of the month Misri. 

\par 2 The angel said to him, “Peace be upon you, O chosen son, our father Isaac!” 

\par 3 Now it was customary every day for the holy angels to speak to him. So he prostrated himself and saw that the angel resembled his father Abraham. 

\par 4 Then he opened his mouth, cried with a loud voice, and said with joy and exultation, “Behold, I have seen your face as if I had seen the face of the merciful Creator.”

\par 5 Then the angel said to him, “O my beloved Isaac, I have been sent to you from the presence of the living God to take you up to heaven to be with your father Abraham and all the saints. 

\par 6 For your father Abraham is awaiting you; he himself is about to come for you, but now he is resting. 

\par 7 There has been prepared for you the throne beside your father Abraham; likewise for your beloved son Jacob. 

\par 8 And all of you shall be above every one else in the kingdom of heaven in the glory of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. 

\par 9 You shall be entrusted with this name for all future generations: The Patriarchs. Thus you shall be fathers to all the world, O faithful elder, our father Isaac.”

\par 10 Isaac answered, saying to the angel, “I am truly amazed concerning you. Are you not my father Abraham?”

\par 11 Then said the angel to him, “I am not your Father Abraham, but I am the one who ministers to your father Abraham. 

\par 12 So now rejoice and be glad; for you will not be smitten (with disease)? and will not be taken (in death) with pain but with joy. 

\par 13 You shall attain to blessings and repose forever and shall go forth from confinement into spaciousness. 

\par 14 Also you shall go away to rejoicing which has no end, and to light and bliss which have no limit, and to acclaim and delight without ceasing. 

\par 15 “And now, make your will and set your house in order; for you are about to go away to (final) rest.

\par 16 Nevertheless, blessedness shall be upon the father who begot you and upon your offspring which shall come after you!”

\par 17 Now when our father Jacob heard them talking in this manner with one another, he began to listen to them, but he did not speak. 

\par 18 Then our father Isaac said to the angel with patience and humility, “What shall I do now with regard to the light of my eye, my beloved Jacob?

\par 19 I fear concerning him on account of Esau. You, of course, know the whole story.”

\par 20 Then the angel said to him, “My beloved Isaac, all the peoples which are in the world, if they were gathered together in one place, would not be able to undo your blessing upon Jacob; because, at that time when you blessed him, he was blessed by the supreme God, also by the Son and the Holy Spirit, and by your father Abraham; all of them responded, saying, ‘Amen.’ 

\par 21 The iron (sword?) will not frighten him, but he will be exceedingly strong and will gain sovereignty. 

\par 22 Then he will become the father of many nations, and twelve tribes will come forth from him.” 

\par 23 Then Isaac said to the angel, “You have informed me and have brought me good news. 

\par 24 But let Jacob not hear, for he will be sad and disturbed; for I have never pained his heart at all.” 

\par 25 Then the angel of the Lord said, “O my beloved Isaac, all the righteous who go out from their bodies have blessedness, and they are blissful when they see God, the Merciful, the Compassionate. 

\par 26 But woe, woe three times, to the sinner when he has been born upon the earth, for he has many pains. 

\par 27 You shall teach your sons your ways and the commandments of your father—all of them which he commanded you. 

\par 28 And do not hide these things from Jacob, that they may be a reminder to the generations of his offspring after him, so that the faithful may observe them and by them attain to the life eternal, which is forever. 

\par 29 But I shall take account of your concern. 

\par 30 Behold, I came to you with joy, speedily. The peace which the Lord gave, I give to you. 

\par 31 And now I go quickly to the one who sent me.” 

\chapter{3}

\par 1 When the angel had said this, he rose from the bed of our father Isaac and moved away from him. 

\par 2 Isaac kept looking at him and was amazed at what he had heard and seen. 

\par 3 So he undertook to say, “I shall not see the light until you send for me.” 

\par 4 While he was meditating on this, Jacob had come forward to the door of his father’s chamber. 

\par 5 The angel had already cast sleep upon him to prevent him from hearing them. 

\par 6 So when he entered the resting place of his father, he said, “Father, with whom were you speaking?” 

\par 7 Isaac his father said to him, “Now you must hear me, my son. Word has been sent to your venerable father that he shall be taken from you, O my son Jacob.” 

\par 8 Then Jacob embraced his father and wept, saying, “My strength has gone from me; will you make me an orphan, O my father, so that this day I shall become wretched?” 

\par 9 Again he embraced our father Isaac and kissed him; both of them wept until they were worn and weary. 

\par 10 Then Jacob said, “O father, I will go away with you and I will not give you up.” 

\par 11 But Isaac said to him, “My boy, this is not for me to do, O my child and my beloved Jacob; but I thank God that you also have become a father and that you will remain until you are summoned. . .? 

\par 12 As my father Abraham informed me, I am not able to set aside any part of the decree, which is valid for everyone; thus it will come to pass, for what is written will not be frustrated. 

\par 13 But God knows, my son, that my heart is weary on account of you. Yet I am happy in my going to the Lord. 

\par 14 So now that you have experienced growth in the Spirit, put away from you this weeping and lamenting. 

\par 15 Listen, my boy, that I may speak to you and give you understanding about the first man, I mean our father Adam, the created one, whom God formed with his own hand; likewise our mother Eve; also Abel and Seth and our father Enoch (Enosh?) and Mahalalel, the father of Methusaleh, and Lamech, the father of Jared, and Enosh (Enoch?), the father of our father Noah and his sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth; and after them Phinehas and Kenan and Noah(?) and Eber and Reu and Terah and Nahor and my father Abraham and Lot the son of his brother.

\par 16 All of these death took away except our father Enoch, the perfect one who ascended to heaven. 

\par 17 “And after this there shall come forth twelve giants. 

\par 18 Then will come Jesus the Messiah from your descendants out of a virgin named Mary.

\par 19 And God will become incarnate in him until the completion of a hundred years.” 

\chapter{4}

\par 1 Now Isaac used to fast every day, not breaking his fast until evening. 

\par 2 He would offer up sacrifices for himself and for all people of his household, for the salvation of their souls. 

\par 3 He would rise up for prayer in the middle of the night, and in the daytime he would pray to God. He kept on doing this for many years. 

\par 4 He would also fast the three forty-day periods, every time the forty-day period came around.’ 

\par 5 And he would not eat meat or drink wine all his life long. 

\par 6 He also would not enjoy the taste of fruit, nor would he sleep upon a bed, because he was devoted to prayer every day and to supplication to God all his life. 

\par 7 So when the crowds heard that a man of God had appeared, they flocked to him from all the districts and places to hear his instructions and life-giving recommendations and to be assured that the spirit of God was speaking in him. 

\par 8 Then the great ones who had flocked to him said, “What is this power which descended upon you after the time when the brightness of your eyesight went from you, and how have you had a reprieve to see now?”

\par 9 Then the faithful old man smiled and said to them, “As to those who have presented themselves, I will inform them that God healed me when he saw that I had drawn near to the gate of death. 

\par 10 He awarded me this honor in my old age that I might be a priest of the Lord.”

\par 11 Then someone (Jacob?) said to him, “Begin for me a discourse that I may be consoled by it and hold fast to it.” 

\par 12 So our father Isaac said to him, “If you speak in anger, guard yourself from slander and beware of empty boasting. 

\par 13 See that you do not converse alone (with a woman).

\par 14 Be careful that an evil word does not is come forth from your mouth. 

\par 15 Guard your body, that it may be pure, for it is the temple of the Holy Spirit, which dwells within it. 

\par 16 Take care of the lesser functions of your body, that it may be pure and sanctified. 

\par 17 See that you do not make sport with your tongue lest an evil word go forth from your mouth. 

\par 18 “Beware of stretching out your hand to what you do not own. 

\par 19 Do not present an offering when you are not ritually clean; bathe yourself in water when you intend to approach the altar. 

\par 20 Do not mingle your thoughts with the thoughts of the world, as you stand at the altar in the presence of God. 

\par 21 Make your offering so that you may be a peacemaker between men. 

\par 22 As you are about to present your offering to God, when you have moved forward to approach the altar, you shall pray to God a hundred times without ceasing. 

\par 23 “At the beginning you shall voice this thanksgiving, as follows, ‘O God, the incomprehensible, who cannot be searched out, the possessor of power, the source of purity, cleanse me by your mercy, a free gift from you to me. 

\par 24 For I am a creature of flesh and blood, fleeing to you. 

\par 25 I know of my uncleanness, and surely you will cleanse me, O Lord. 

\par 26 “For behold, my cause is in your hands and my recourse is to you. 

\par 27 I know my sin, so cleanse me, O Lord, that I may enter into your presence with self-respect. 

\par 28 Now my offenses are weighty; I have drawn near to the fire which burns. 

\par 29 Your mercy is upon all things, so that you can take away all my transgressions. 

\par 30 Pardon me, even me, the sinner. 

\par 31 And pardon all your creatures whom you have fashioned, but who have not heard and learned of you.

\par 32 “‘I am like all who are in your image. I have turned to the doing of what is forbidden to me. 

\par 33 I have come to you and I am your servant and the sinful son of your nation, but you are the very forgiving one. 

\par 34 Forgive me by the graciousness that comes from you, and hear my entreaty that I may be worthy of standing at your holy altar. 

\par 35 May this burnt offering be acceptable to you. 

\par 36 Do not turn me back to my ignorance because of my sins. Receive me like the lost sheep. 

\par 37 May the God who provided for our father Adam, and Abel and Noah, and our father Abraham, be with you, O Jacob, and with me also. 

\par 38 Receive my offering from me.’

\par 39 “So if you have approached and have done this before your ascent to the altar, then offer your sacrifice. 

\par 40 But you shall take care and be alert that you do not grieve the spirit of the Lord. 

\par 41 For the work of the priesthood is not easy, since it is incumbent upon every priest, from today until the completion of the last of the generations and the end of the world, that he should not be filled by the drinking of wine nor be satisfied by the eating of bread; and that he should not talk about 

\par 42 the concerns of the world nor listen to one who does talk about them. But priests must expend all of their efforts and their lives in prayer and watchfulness and perseverance in piety, in order that each one may petition the Lord successfully. 

\par 43 “Moreover, every man on earth, whether wretched or fortunate, has incumbent upon him the keeping of the proper commandments. 

\par 44 For men, after a short time, will be removed from this world and its intense anxiety. 

\par 45 Then they will be engaged in holy, angelic service by reason of purity. 

\par 46 They will be presented before the Lord and his angels because of their pure offerings and their angelic service. 

\par 47 For their earthly conduct will be reflected in heaven, and the angels will be their friends because of their perfect faith and purity. 

\par 48 Great is their esteem before the Lord, and there is no one either small or great in whom the Lord will not make improvement; for the Lord wishes that each be without fault or offense. 

\par 49 “And now, continue to supplicate God with repentance for your past sins, and do not commit more sin. 

\par 50 Accordingly, do not kill with the sword, do not kill with the tongue, do not fornicate with your body, and do not remain angry until sunset. 

\par 51 Do not let yourself receive unjustified praise, and do not rejoice at the fall of your enemies or of your brothers. 

\par 52 Do not blaspheme; beware of slander. 

\par 53 Do not look at a woman with a lustful eye. 

\par 54 These things and what is like them you shall guard against, in order that each one of you may be saved from the wrath which will be manifested from heaven. ”

\chapter{5}

\par 1 When the throngs who were surrounding them heard this, they cried out with one accord, saying, “Truly everything which this venerable man has said is worthy of attention.” 

\par 2 But he remained silent, pulled up his cloak, and covered his face. 

\par 3 The assemblage and the priest who was present, after a silence, said: “Let him rest a little.” 

\par 4 Then the angel of God came to him and took him to the heavens. 

\par 5 There he beheld certain things in fear. 

\par 6 Many wild beasts(?) were within easy reach. 

\par 7 The sides . . . (?) like the brothers so that they could not get sight of one another.

\par 8 Their faces were like the faces of camels and some were like the faces of dogs. 

\par 9 Others were like the faces of lions and hyenas and tigers; and some had only one eye. 

\par 10 Isaac said, “I looked and, behold, they had agreed on a person and were hurrying him along. 

\par 11 And when they had made a sign to the lions, those who were walking with him withdrew from him. 

\par 12 Then the lions turned upon him, tore him apart in the middle, dismembered him, and chewed and swallowed him. 

\par 13 After this they ejected him from their mouths and he returned to his original state. 

\par 14 And after the lions the others came forward and did the same thing to him. 

\par 15 One after the other they would take him, and every one of them would chew him, swallow him, and eject him, and he would return to his original state.” 

\par 16 Then I said to the angel, “O my lord, what is the sin which this man has committed that he should have to endure a burden like this?” 

\par 17 The angel said to me, “It is because this man, whom you see, was in enmity with his neighbor for five hours, and he died without having been reconciled with him. 

\par 18 So he was handed over to five of the tormentors that they might torment him a whole year for each of the five hours which he spent as the enemy of his friend.” 

\par 19 Then the angel said to me, “O my beloved Isaac, see here the sixty myriads who inflict torture for each hour that the man remains hostile to his neighbor. 

\par 20 He is brought here to these creatures who torture him, each one of them for an hour until a full year is completed if he had not been making peace and repenting of his sin before his removal and his separation from his body.” 

\par 21 Then he brought me to a river of fire. I saw it throbbing, with its waves rising to about thirty cubits; and its sound was like rolling thunder. 

\par 22 I looked upon many souls being immersed in it to a depth of about nine cubits. 

\par 23 They were weeping and crying out with a loud voice and great groaning, those who were in that river. 

\par 24 And that river had wisdom in its fire: It would not harm the righteous, but only the sinners by burning them. 

\par 25 It would burn every one of them because of the stench and repugnance of the odor surrounding the sinners. 

\par 26 Then I observed the deep river? whose smoke had come up before me, and I saw a group of people at the bottom of it, screaming, weeping, every one of them lamenting. 

\par 27 The angel said to me, “Look at the bottom to observe those whom you see at the lowest depth. They are the ones who have committed the sin of Sodom; truly, they were due a drastic punishment. ”

\par 28 Then I saw the overseer of punishment and he was all of him fire. 

\par 29 He would strike the myrmidons of hell (his helpers) and say to them, “Kill them that it may be known that God exists forever.” 

\par 30 Then the angel said to me, “Lift up your eyes and look at the whole gamut of punishments.” 

\par 31 But I said to the angel, “‘My sight cannot embrace them because of their great number; but I desire to understand how long these people are to be in this torture.” 

\par 32 He said to me, “Until the God of mercy becomes merciful and has mercy on them.”

\chapter{6}

\par 1 After this the angel took me to heaven and I saw Abraham. 

\par 2 So I prostrated myself before him and he received me graciously, he and all the godly ones. 

\par 3 Then they all came together and did me honor because of my father. 

\par 4 Then they took me by the hand and led me to the curtain before the throne of the Father. 

\par 5 So I prostrated myself before him and worshiped him with my father and all the saints, while we uttered praises and cried aloud, saying, “Most holy, most holy, most holy is the Lord Sabaoth! Heaven and earth are filled with your sanctified glory.” 

\par 6 Then the Lord said to me from his holy height, “As to everyone who shall name his son after my beloved Isaac, my blessing shall rest upon him and be in his house forever. 

\par 7 Excellent is your coming, O Abraham, faithful one; excellent is your lineage, and excellent is the presence here of this blessed lineage. 

\par 8 So now, everything which you ask in the name of your beloved son Isaac you shall have today as a covenant forever.” 

\par 9 Then my father Abraham answered and said, “Yours is the sovereignty, O Lord, ruler of the universe.” 

\par 10 The Lord from his holy height said to my father Abraham, “Every man who shall call his son by the name of my beloved Isaac, or shall write his own testament, shall have a blessing which shall not come to an end, and my blessing upon his house shall not cease. 

\par 11 Or if anyone will give a poor man something to eat on the day of the festival of my beloved Isaac then I will give him to you in my kingdom.” 

\par 12 Then my father Abraham said, “O Father, God, ruler of the universe, even if he is not able to write his testament or his covenant, let your blessing and your mercy enfold him, for you are the merciful one.” 

\par 13 The Lord said to Abraham, Let him feed the hungry one with bread and I will give him a place in my kingdom and he shall be present with you from the first moment of the millennial banquet.” 

\par 14 The saving God also said to my father Abraham, “And if he is so poor that he does not find bread in his house, then let him spend a whole night commemorating my beloved Isaac without sleeping and I will bestow upon him a heritage in my kingdom.” 

\par 15 My father Abraham said, “And if he is weak and cannot endure the vigil, then may your mercy and compassion still enfold him.” 

\par 16 So the Lord said to him, “Then let him offer a little incense in my name on the memorial day of my beloved Isaac, your son. 

\par 17 And if it should be that he does not know how to read, then let him go to hear the reading from one who can read it. 

\par 18 If he cannot do any of these things, then let him enter his house, lock the door behind him, and pray a hundred prayers of repentance; then I will give him to you as a son in my kingdom. 

\par 19 But above and beyond all this, let him bring an offering on the memorial day of my beloved Isaac. 

\par 20 And all those who shall do all that I have said shall be granted the inheritance of the kingdom in my heaven. 

\par 21 And all who took pains to write their testaments and covenants and life stories, and showed mercy if only (by giving) a cup of cold water, and believed with all their hearts—with them shall be my strength and my Holy Spirit for the prosperity of their affairs in the world. 

\par 22 There shall not be any trouble in their departure (from this world), I will grant them a lifetime in my kingdom, and they shall be present from the first moment of the millennial banquet. 

\par 23 Peace be upon you, O my beloved ones, the saints!’ 

\par 24 When he had concluded all this discourse, the heavenly beings began to cry out, saying, “Most holy, most holy, most holy is the Lord, Sabaoth! Heaven and earth are filled with your sanctified glory.” 

\par 25 The Father who controls everything answered from this holy place and said, “O Michael, my faithful servant, call in all the angels and all the saints.” 

\par 26 Then he mounted the chariot of the seraphim, while the cherubim went before [with the angels. 

\par 27 And when they had come to the couch of our father Isaac, our father Isaac immediately beheld the face of our Lord, full of joy toward him. 

\par 28 He cried out, “It is well that you have come, my Lord, with your great archangel, Michael. It is well that you have come, my Father, with all the saints.”].? 

\par 29 When he has said this, Jacob was greatly disturbed and he clung to his father and kissed him, weeping. 

\par 30 Then our father Isaac raised him up and made a sign to him, giving a hint with his eyes, meaning, “Be silent, my boy.” 

\par 31 So Abraham said to the Lord, “O Lord, remember also my (grand)son Jacob.”’ 

\par 32 Then the Lord said to him, “‘My power shall be with him, he shall glorify my name, he shall become master of the land of promise, and the enemy shall not hold Sway over him.” 

\par 33 And our father Isaac said, “Jacob, my beloved son, keep my injunction which I lay down today that you preserve my body. 

\par 34 Do not profane the image of God by how you treat it; for the image of man was made like the image of God; and God will treat you accordingly at the time when you meet him and see him face to face. 

\par 35 He is the first and the last, as the prophets have said.” 

\chapter{7}

\par 1 When Isaac had said this, the Lord took his soul from his body and it was white as snow; he took possession of it and carried it with him upon his holy chariot and ascended with it to the heavens, while the cherubim were singing praises before it, likewise his holy angels. 

\par 2 The Lord bestowed upon him the kingdom of heaven; and everything which our father desired out of the abundance of blessings from God he had, including the fulfillment of his covenant forever.

\chapter{8}

\par 1 Such was the decease of our father Abraham and our father Isaac, son of Abraham, on the twenty-eighth day of the month of Misri, on this very day. This day we have consecrated and designated. 

\par 2 And on the day when our father Abraham offered the sacrifice to God, on the twenty-eighth day of the month of Amshir, the heavens and the earth were filled with the sweet fragrance of his way of life before the Lord. 

\par 3 And our father Isaac was like the silver which is burned, smelted, purified, and refined in the fire; likewise everyone who shall come forth from our father Isaac, the father of fathers. 

\par 4 On the day when Abraham, the father of fathers, offered him as a sacrifice to God, the perfume of his sacrifice ascended to the veil of the curtain of the one who controls everything. 

\par 5 Blessed is everyone who manifests mercy on the memorial day of the father of fathers, our father Abraham and our father Isaac, for each of them shall have a dwelling in the kingdom of heaven, because our Lord has made with them his true covenant forever. 

\par 6 And he will keep it for them and for those who come after them, saying to them, “Whatever person has manifested mercy in the name of my beloved Isaac, behold I will give him to you in the kingdom of heaven and he shall be present with them at the first moment of the millennial banquet to celebrate with them in the everlasting light in the kingdom of our Master and our God and our King and our Savior, Jesus the Messiah. 

\par 7 He is the one to whom are due the glory, the dignity, the majesty, the dominion, the reverence, the honor, the praise, and the adoration, along with the merciful Father and the Holy Spirit now and for all time, and to all eternity and forever and ever, amen!”

\chapter{9}

\par 1 The obsequies of our father Isaac are finished. Thanks and praise to God, always, forever, and eternally.
