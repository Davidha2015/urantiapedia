\title{Ladder of Jacob}

\chapter{1}

\par 1 Jacob then went to Laban his uncle. 

\par 2 He found a place and, laying his head on a stone, he slept there, for the sun had gone down. 

\par 3 He had a dream. And behold, a ladder was fixed on the earth, whose top reached to heaven. 

\par 4 And the top of the ladder was the face as of a man, carved out of fire. 

\par 5 There were twelve steps leading to the top of the ladder, and on each step to the top there were two human faces, on the right and on the left, twenty-four faces (or busts) including their chests. 

\par 6 And the face in the middle was higher than all that I saw, the one of fire, including the shoulders and arms, exceedingly temfying, more than those twenty-four faces. 

\par 7 And while I was still looking at it, behold, angels of God ascended and descended on it. 

\par 8 And God was standing above its highest face, and he called to me from there, saying, “Jacob, Jacob!” And I said, “Here I am, LORD!”

\par 9 And he said to me, “The land on which you are sleeping, to you will I give it, and to your seed after you. 

\par 10 And I will multiply your seed as the stars of heaven and the sand of the sea. 

\par 11 And through your seed all the earth and those living on it in the last times of the years of completion shall be blessed.

\par 12 My blessing with which I have blessed you shall flow from you unto the last
\par generation; the East and the West all shall be full of your tribe.”

\chapter{2}

\par 1 And when I heard (this) from on high, awe and trembling fell upon me. 

\par 2 And I rose up from my dream and, the voice still being in my ears, I said,

\par 3 “How fearful is this place! This is none Other than the house of God and this is the gate of heaven.” 

\par 4 And I set up the stone which had been my pillow as a pillar, and I poured olive oil on the top of it, and I called the name of that place the House of God. 

\par 5 And I stood and began to sing, and I said, 

\par 6 "LORD God of Adam your creature and
\par LORD God of Abraham and Isaac my fathers
\par and of all who have walked before you in justice!

\par 7 You who sit firmlyb on the cherubim and the fieryc throne of glory
. . . and the many-eyed (ones) just as I saw in my dream,


\par 8 holding the four-faced cherubim,
\par bearing also the many-eyed seraphim,

\par 9 carrying the whole worldd under your arm,
\par yet not being borne by anyone;

\par 10 you who have made the skies firm for the glory of your name,

\par 11 stretching out on two heavenly clouds the heaven which gleams under you,

\par 12 that beneath it you may cause the sun to course and conceal it during the night so that it might not seem a god;

\par 13 (you) who made on them a way for the moon and the stars;

\par 14 and you make the moon wax and wane, and destine the stars to pass on
\par so that they too might not seem gods.

\par 15 Before the face of your glory the six-winged seraphim are afraid, and they
\par cover their feet and faces with their wings, while flying with their
\par Other (wings), and they sing unceasingly a hymn:

\par 16 ‘. . . whom I now in sanctifying a new (song)

\par 17 Twelve-topped, twelve-faced, many-named, fiery one!
\par Lightning-eyed holy one!

\par 18 Holy, Holy, Holy, Yao, Y aova, Yaoil, Yao,
\par Kados, Chavod, Savaoth,

\par 19 Omlemlech il avir amismi varich,
\par eternal king, mighty, powerful, most great,
\par patient, blessed one!’

\par 20 You who fill heaven and earth, the sea and abysses
\par and all the ages with your glory,

\par 21 hear my song with which I have sung you and grant me the request I ask of you,

\par 22 and tell me the interpretation of my dream,
\par for you are a god who is mighty, powerful and glorious,
\par a god who is holy; my LORD and LORD of my fathers.”

\chapter{3}


\par 1 And while I was still saying this prayer, behold, a voice came before my face saying, 

\par 2 “Sariel, leader of the beguiled, you who are in charge of dreams, go and make Jacob understand the meaning of the dream he has had and explain to him everything he saw; but first bless him.”

\par 3 And Sariel the archangel came to me and I saw (him), and his appearance was very beautiful and awesome. 

\par 4 But I was not astonished by his appearance, for the vision which I had seen in my dream was more terrible than he. 

\par 5 And I did not fear the vision of the angel.

\chapter{4}

\par 1 And the angel said to me, “What is your name?”

\par 2 And I said, “Jacob.”

\par 3 (He announced), “Your name shall no longer be called Jacob, but your name shall be similar to my name, Israel.” 

\par 4 And when I was going from Phandana of Syria to meet Esau my brother, he came to me and blessed me and called me Israel.

\par 5 And he would not tell me his name until I adjured him. 

\par 6 And then he said to me, “As you were kep zul. . .”

\chapter{5}

\par 1 Thus he said to me: "You have seen a ladder with twelve steps, each step having two human faces which kept changing their appearance. 

\par 2 The ladder is this age, 

\par 3 and the twelve steps are the periods of this age. 

\par 4 But the twenty-four faces are the kings of the ungodly nations of this age. 

\par 5 Under these kings the children of your children and the generations of your sons will be interrogated. 

\par 6 These will rise up against the iniquity of your grandsons. 

\par 7 And this place will be made desolate by the four ascents ... through the sins of your grandsons.

\par 8 And around the property of your forefathers a palace will be built, a temple in the name of your God and of (the God) of your fathers, 

\par 9 and in the provocations of your children it will become desertedf by the four ascentsg of this age. 

\par 10 For you saw the first four bustsh which were striking against the steps . . .

\par 11 angels ascending and descending, and the busts amid the steps. 

\par 12 The Most High will raise up kings from the grandsons of your brother Esau, and they will receive all the nobles of the tribes of the earth who will have maltreated your seed. 

\par 13 And they will be delivered into his hands and he will be vexedj by them. 

\par 14 And he will hold them by force and rule over them, and they will not be able to oppose him until the day when his thought will go out against them to serve idols and (to offer) sacrifices of the dead. 

\par 15 . . .(He will) do violence to all those in his kingdom who will be revealed in such guilt, both to the highest (man)l from your tribe and kfalkonagargailyuya. 

\par 16 Know, Jacob, that your descendants shall be exiles in a strangen land, and they will afflict them with slavery and inflict wounds on them every day. 

\par 17 But the LORD will judge the people for whom they slave.

\chapter{6}

\par 1 “And when the king arises, judgment too will come upon that place. 

\par 2 Then your seed, Israel, will go out of slaverya to the nations who hold them by force, and they will be free from any rebuke of your enemies. 

\par 3 For this king is the head of all revenge and retaliationb against those who have done evil to you, Israel, and the end of the age. 

\par 4 For bitter ones will rise;c they will cry out, and the LORD will hear them and accept their plea. 

\par 5 And the Mighty One will repent because of their sufferings. 

\par 6 For the angels and archangels will hurl their bolts of lightning before them for the sake of the salvation of your tribe. 

\par 7 And you will gain the mercy of the Most High. 

\par 8 Then their wives will bear many children. 

\par 9 And afterward the LORD will fight for your tribe through great and terrible signs against those who made them slaves. 

\par 10 He filled their storehouses, and they will be found empty. 

\par 11 Their land swarmed with reptiles and all sorts of deadly things.

\par 12 There will be earthquakes and much desüuction. 

\par 13 And the LORD will pour out his wrath against Leviathan the sea-dragon; he will kill the lawless Falkon with the sword, because he will raise the wrath of the God of gods by his pride. 

\par 14 And then your justice will be revealed, Jacob, and that of your childrene who are to be after you (and) who will walk in your justice. •And then your seed will sound the hom and all the kingdom of Edom will perish together with all the peoples of Moab.

\chapter{7}

\par 1 “And as for the angels you saw descending and ascending the ladder,

\par 2 in the last years there will be a man from the Most High, and he will desire to join the upper (things) with the lower. 

\par 3 And before his coming your sons and daughters will tell about him and your young men will have visions about him. 

\par 4 Such will be the signs at the time of his coming: 

\par 5 A tree cut with an ax will bleed; 

\par 6 three-month-old babes will speak understanding; 

\par 7 a baby in the womb of his mother will speak of his way; 

\par 8 a youth will be like an Old man. 

\par 9 And then the expected one will come, whose path will not be noticed by anyone.

\par 10 “Then the earth will be glorified, receiving heavenly glory. 

\par 11 What was above will be below also.c 

\par 12 And from your seed will bloom a root of kings; 

\par 13 it will emerged and overthrow the power of evil. 

\par 14 And he himself will be the Savior for every land and rest for those who toil, and a Cloud shading the whole world from the buming heat. 

\par 15 For otherwise the uncontrollede will not be controlled. 

\par 16 If he does not come,f the lower (things) cannot be joined with the upper. 

\par 17 At his coming the idols of brass, stone, and any sort of carving will give voice for three days.

\par 18 They will give wise men news of him and let them know what will be on earth.

\par 19 By a star, those who wish to see on earth him whom the angels do not see above will find the way to him. 

\par 20 Then the Almighty will be on earth in body, and, embraced by corporeal arms, he will restore human matter. 

\par 21 And he will revive Eve, who died by the fruit of the tree. 

\par 22 Then the deceit of the impious will be exposed and all the idols will fall face down. 

\par 23 For they will be put to shame by a dignitary. 

\par 24 For because (they were) lying by means of hallucinations, henceforth they will not be able to rule or to prophesy. 

\par 25 Honor will be tdcen from them and they will remain without glory.

\par 26 “For he who comes will take power and might and will give Abraham the truth which he previously told him. 

\par 27 Everything Sharp he will make dull, and the rough will be smooth. 

\par 28 And he will cast all the iniquitous into the depths of the sea. 

\par 29 He will work wonders in heaven and on earth. 

\par 30 And he will be wounded in the midst of his beloved house.

\par 31 And when he is wounded, then salvation will be ready, and the end to all perdition. 

\par 32 For those who have wounded him will themselves receive a wound which will not be cured in them forever. 

\par 33 And all creation will bow to him who was wounded, and many will frust in him. 

\par 34 And he will become known everywhere in all lands, and those who acknowledge his name will not be ashamed. 

\par 35 His own dominion and years will be unending forever.”
