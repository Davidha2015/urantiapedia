every human being should remember: Many ambitions to excel which tantalize mortals in the flesh will not persist with these same mortals in the morontia and spirit careers, but before ascending mortals leave the local universe to embark upon their spirit careers, they will be satiated respecting every intellectual, artistic, and social longing or true ambition (44:8.4-5)
ambitions may thwart maternal instinct (84:1.7)

ancestor worship; veneration of ancestry; ancestors | (87:3) | religion | | OK
The advancing ghost cult made ancestor worship inevitable (87:3.1)
The great weakness of ancestor veneration is that it promotes a backward-looking philosophy. (79:8.8)
ancestor worship is based on the belief that the dead punished those who did not follow the rules that they had followed when they they were in the flesh (68:4.3)
Ancestor worshipers view the failure to have sons as the supreme calamity for all time and eternity. (84:7.19)
The great strength in a veneration of ancestry is the value that such an attitude places upon the family. (79:8.9-10)
Later this ritual developed into a pseudo seance at which ghosts were reputed to have appeared. (70:7.15)
During a certain period, solar veneration became a species of ancestor worship. (95:2.7)
in Israel
	Jews tended to overhonor ancestors (140:8.14)
in Europe
	both the Greeks and the Romans favored monogamous marriage. (83:6.3)

	the Ancients of Days are the most powerful and mighty of any of the direct rulers of the time-space creations. (18:3.7)
	Apparently they are the supreme rulers of the superuniverses; but they have not experientially earned this right to rule and are therefore destined sometime to be superseded by the Supreme Being, an experiential sovereign, whose vicegerents they will undoubtedly become. (18:3.8) (55:12.3,5) (116:0.5) (117:2.7)

	They possess individuality and are in personality diverse, but they do not differ from each other as do the Seven Master Spirits. (18:3.2)
	To deduce the will of one of the Gods from a knowledge of the other two, the three Ancients of Days must act together; two would not be able to achieve the answer. (28:4.10)
	The Ancients of Days perfectly deduce the Father’s will by equating the Spirit voice-flash from above and the Michael voice-flashes from below, by reflectivity (28:4.10)

Abodes
	The personal abodes of each trio of the Ancients of Days are located at the point of spiritual polarity on their headquarters sphere. (18:3.6)
	They never personally leave their residential worlds, but then they do not have to, for these worlds are the superuniverse focal points of the far-flung reflectivity system. (18:3.5)
Relationship with mortals
	When mortals of time graduate from the training worlds of a local universe and are advanced to the educational spheres of their superuniverse, they are able to recognize and communicate with the high spiritual rulers, including the Ancients of Days. (18:3.1)
supreme judges
	they are who accredit mortals for Son-fusion when Father-fusion has failed (40:8.3)
	Celestial Guardians are the apprehending agents of the Ancients of Days; they go forth from Uversa to bring back beings whose presence is required before the superuniverse judges; they execute the mandates for the detention of any personality in the superuniverse. (22:9.4)
	in some cases, Ancients of Days flash forth the mandate of advanced standing over the communication circuits to Salvington, and, thus released, the tribunals of the Sovereign of Nebadon will decree the immediate passage of the surviving soul to the resurrection (112:4.12)
	they have never reversed the verdict of a tribunal of Trinity divinity, that is constitutes by a Perfector of Wisdom, seven Divine Counselors, and one Universal Censor (19:3.4)

	Judgment belongs to the Ancients of Days, the rulers of the superuniverse. (53:1.2)
	they do not sit in judgment except in association with the Universal Censors. (19:4.1)
	There is no appeal from the rulings and decisions of the superuniverse authorities since they represent the concurred opinions of the Ancients of Days and that Master Spirit who, from Paradise, presides over the destiny of the superuniverse concerned. (15:12.4)
	they are personifications of Trinity justice-judgment in time and space (19:3.5) (116:4.6)
	the Ancients of Days refuse to annihilate any being until all moral values and all spiritual realities are extinct, both in the evildoer and in all related supporters and possible sympathizers. (54:3.3)
	they seldom execute wrongdoers without a full hearing. (54:5.7)

Andites; Andite | (78) (80) | Aryans; races | RACE | OK
The Andites were the best all-round human stock to appear on Urantia since the days of Adamites; most skillful and sagacious militarists ever to live on Urantia (78:4.3-6) (80:4.3)
The Andites were a great people, but the crucial factor in determining the course of their civilization was the increasing aridity of Iran, Turkestan, and Sinkiang, which forced them to invent and adopt new and advanced methods of wresting a livelihood from their decreasingly fertile lands. (81:6.4)
they drove Andonites out of Europe (80:9.6-7)
It was the violet race and their Andite successors who first attempted to divorce the mathematical from the volitional. (103:6.10)
These early Andites were not Aryan; they were pre-Aryan. They were not white; they were pre-white. They were neither an Occidental nor an Oriental people. But it is Andite inheritance that gives to the polyglot mixture of the so-called white races that generalized homogeneity which has been called Caucasoid. (78:4.4)
migrations of Andites (79) (80) (78:5-6)
	Mesopotamia and Egipt
		Andites migrated from Mesopotamia to Egipt and settled along the Nile (80:6)
		Five per cent of the Andites, the very superior culture of the coastal district about the mouths of the Tigris and Euphrates who had kept themselves free from intermarriage with the inferior neighboring tribesmen, refused to leave their homes. (78:6.6) (78:8.1)
		The Andites had almost entirely evacuated this region by 6000 B.C. (78:6.7) (80:1.1)
		These early migrations extended over a period of ten thousand years, from 25,000 to 15,000 B.C. (78:3.9)
		Sumerians were the last Andites of Mesopotamia (78:8.1)
	Europe
		they migrated to the Occident (80)
		also they do it in the Orient (79)
		Turkestan was the first destiny before turning around to Europe and the east (79:1)
		Andites poured into Europe and Mediterranean region in a steady stream; there were seven major invasions, the last arrivals coming on horseback in three great waves (80:4,5,7,9) (80:9.9)
		For three thousand years the military headquarters of the northern Andites was in Denmark. (80:5.2)
		Andites were the ancestors of the so-called Nordic races, the forefathers of the Scandinavian, German, and Anglo-Saxon peoples. (80:4.5) (80:9.2)
		The Andites not only migrated to Europe but to northern China and India, while many groups penetrated to the ends of the earth as missionaries, teachers, and traders. (78:5.5)
		they mingled with the remnants of the commingled Saharans and the southern blue men of Europe (80:8.1) (80:9.8)
	India
		some Andites were the so-called Dravidian and later Aryan conquerors of India; and their presence in central Asia greatly upstepped the ancestors of the Turanians. (78:5.6) (79:5.1) (94:1.1)
		Andites were racially obliterated in India (79:2.5-6) (79:3.5)
	Japan and South America
		One hundred and thirty-two of Andites, embarking in a fleet of small boats from Japan, eventually reached South America and by intermarriage with the natives of the Andes established the ancestry of the later rulers of the Incas. (78:5.7) (79:5.9)
	Other
		The North American Indians never came in contact with even the Andite offspring of Adam and Eve (79:5.7)
		Siberian Andonites were assimilated by northen Andites (80:4.2)
influence in the races
	And to every nation to which they journeyed, they contributed humor, art, adventure, music, and manufacture; proclivities toward adventure and exploration;  love, romance, and personal selection in premarital courtship (78:4.5-6) (78:5.8) (80:5.7) (81:3.8) (83:2.5)
	There is real danger in the combination of restlessness, curiosity, adventure, and pleasure-abandon characteristic of the post-Andite races. (84:8.4)
	in races containing Andite inheritance, children are not so placid; these more imaginative and adventurous youths require more training and discipline. (84:7.21)
	the unifying factor in white race is Andite inheritance (81:4.11)
origin
	this race began with the 1570 sons and daughters that Adam impregnated in a group of Nodite women coordinated by Eve (76:4.8)
	the term Andite is used to designate those peoples whose racial inheritance was from one-eighth to one-sixth violet. (78:4.1)
	As they moved westward across the Russian plains, absorbing the best of the blue man and exterminating the worst, they became blended into one people. (80:4.5) (80:5.5-6) (80:8.1) (80:9.11)
	They embraced most of the highest types of the surviving remnants of the Adamite and Nodite races and, later, some of the best strains of the yellow, blue, and green men. (77:3.9) (78:0.1-2) (78:4.1-4)
	the union of Nodites and Adamites caused the renaissance of the Garden and formed the Andites (78:5.1)
traditions
	they had red or blond hair (79:1.8)
	originally they were not cannibalistic, but they were after become grossly admixed with the evolutionary races (89:5.3) (89:6.1)
	The early Andites thought their ghosts returned to the ancestral homelands. (86:4.8)
	they practiced in-marriage a lot (82:5.4)
	they domesticated many animals that were domesticated twice in the past and then were not anymore (81:2.11-12)
	But the horse was the evolutionary factor which determined the dominance of the Andites in the Occident. (80:4.4) (81:2.12)
	they worked metals: bronze, iron, gold, copper (81:3.4)
	Human society would be greatly improved if the civilized races would more generally return to the family-council practices of the Andites. (84:7.29)

	the race retrogressed for 500,000 years after Andon (63:5.7) (63:6.1)
	their further migration was blocked by the ice (64:1.1-2)
	During the periods of farthest glacial advance the westernmost of the Andon tribes came very near being driven into the sea. (64:7.17)
	they were driven from the plains of Europe by the blue man and from the river valleys of farther Asia by the expanding yellow race. (78:1.5) (79:6.1)
	By 3000 B.C. increasing aridity drove Andonites into Turkestan, and then to Europe (80:9.6)
	it was this extensive southward movement of Andonites that diluted the Andites in central Asia nearly to the vanishing point. (79:1.7)
	The earliest race mixtures in India were a blending of the migrating red and yellow races with the aboriginal Andonites. (79:2.2)
	Andonites held northern Pacific islands (79:6.3)
	Andites and Andonites, in considerable numbers, were traversing the pass of Ti Tao and spreading out over the upper valley of the Yellow River (79:7.1)
	The purer Andonites lived in the extreme northern regions of Europe and in Iceland, Greenland, and northeastern North America. (64:7.16)
	a horde of Andonites entered Europe from the north, having come from Siberia by way of the Russian rivers and the Baltic, and they were immediately assimilated by the northern Andite tribes. (80:4.2)
	The Danubians were Andonites, farmers and herders who had entered Europe through the Balkan peninsula and were moving slowly northward by way of the Danube valley. (80:8)
	These descendants of Andon were dispersed through most of the mountainous regions of central and southeastern Europe. (80:8.2)
	The Andonites maintained five or six fairly representative settlements to the north and east of the Adamson headquarters, after Adam (78:1.5)
	they were scattered over Arctic and central Asia in 15,000 B.C. (78:3.7)
	migrated to Iceland, and Greenland (64:7.18)
	Hittites stemmed directly from the Andonite stock (80:8.2)
	Andonites were absorbed in blue and white races (80:0.2) (80:3.2) (80:9.2)
physical characteristics (63:4.1)
	the Andonites had black eyes and a swarthy complexion, something of a cross between yellow and red.
	The Danubians were Andonites, farmers and herders who had entered Europe through the Balkan peninsula and were moving slowly northward by way of the Danube valley. (80:8.4-5)
	they had 36 teeth (65:6.5)
	Lapps and Eskimos are the nearest today's peoples to aboriginal Andonic type (61:6.3) (63:4.1) (65:2.7) (70:1.2) (81:4.9)
	they were not so sensitive to pain nor so reactive to unpleasant situations as were many of the later evolving mortals. (63:4.2)
	they had pale skins and broad-heads (80:8.2) (81:4.2-4)
	reached full maturity at twelve years of age and possessed a potential life span of about seventy-five years. (62:5.3)
practices
	possessed a touching affection for their comrades and certainly had a real, although crude, idea of friendship (63:4.4)
	They were very loyal to their families; they would die without question in defense of their children, but they were not able to grasp the idea of trying to make the world a better place for their grandchildren. (63:4.3)
	all except Badonans practiced human sacrifice (64:3.1)
	they were cliff and grotto dwellers (63:5.4)
	showed great skill in constructing stone sleeping chambers, dome-shaped stone huts, into which they crawled at night (63:5.5)
	they evolved a form of animal worship (63:6.3)
	They were exceedingly imitative, but the play instinct was only slightly developed, and the sense of humor was almost entirely absent. (63:4.2)
	they became highly skillful in the fashioning of flint tools (63:5.6) (64:2.5)
	The Andonites early developed a fear of the elements—thunder, lightning, rain, snow, hail, and ice. (63:6.3)
	The Andonites were fearless and successful hunters and, with the exception of wild berries and certain fruits of the trees, lived exclusively on flesh. (63:5.6)
	They were the first marine adventurers. (64:7.17)
	with the exception of wild berries and certain fruits of the trees, lived exclusively on flesh. (63:5.6)
	The Sangiks were all cannibalistic, but originally the Andonites were not (89:5.3-5) (89:6.1)
	While taboos on twins were once well-nigh universal, they were never a part of the Andonite mores; these peoples always regarded twins as omens of good luck. (68:6.8)
	warfare
		they had constant battles with inferior tribes (63:4.4)
		A thoughtful Andonite who had severely bruised his fist in a serious combat rediscovered the idea of using a long stick for his arm and a piece of hard flint, bound on the end with sinews, for his fist. (68:5.4)
		This early race and its primitive civilization were threatened with extinction by this incessant warfare of the clans. (63:4.7-9)
		Only two things came to occupy the minds of these peoples: hunting to obtain food and fighting to avenge of the neighboring tribes. (63:4.7)
	sexual practices
		some mated with simians (63:1.4)
		the more intelligent groups never entertained the idea of going southward to live among their hairy tree-dwelling cousins of inferior intellect. (64:1.1-2)
		The groups going west became less contaminated with the backward stocks of mutual ancestral origin than those going east, who mingled so freely with their retarded animal cousins. (64:1.7) (85:3.1)
		they mixed with blue races (81:4.2-9)
Religion
	Onagar was truth teacher to Andonites (63:6)
	they taught golden rule (70:1.2)
