Dalamatia; Dalamatian | | Caligastia; Caligastia one hundred | PLACE | OK
Dalamatia was the city that was built in the distant past to house the headquarters of the Planetary Prince. It was located in the Persian Gulf region, in the area corresponding to later Mesopotamia. (66:3)
This world center of culture was named Dalamatia in honor of Daligastia. (66:3.3)
it was a very simple but beautiful city, enclosed within a wall 40 feet high. (66:3.3) (66:4.10)
The country around the city was quite well settled within a radius of 100 miles. (66:7.18)
the residential buildings were models of neatness and cleanliness, everything was very simple and altogether primitive, built of brick (66:3.5-6) (66:7.1-3)
The land provision within the city walls was sufficient to provide for pasturage and gardening for the support of a population of about 20,000. (66:7.1)
the law of Dalamatia for almost 300,000 years was the code known as “The Father’s Way” and consisted of the following seven commands: (66:7.8-16)
# You shall not fear nor serve any God but the Father of all.
# You shall not disobey the Father’s Son
# You shall not speak a lie
# You shall not kill men
# You shall not steal
# You shall not touch your friend’s wife.
# You shall not show disrespect to your parents
The definite order of family life and the living of one family together in one residence of comparatively settled location date from these times of Dalamatia (66:7)
life in Dalamatia was far from being utopian (68:1.7)
Although the races were at war, they lived together in harmony near the seat of the Prince (64:6.28)
the rebellion
	At the outbreak of the rebellion, Dalamatia had a resident population of almost 6000. (66:7.20)
	it was attacked by hordes of semisavages after the rebellion, who besieged its walls and drove out its inhabitants (67:5.2)
	Great confusion reigned in Dalamatia and thereabout for almost fifty years after the instigation of rebellion. (67:5.1)
	The Dalamatia library, destroyed soon after the Caligastia disaffection, comprised more than two million separate records and was known as the “house of Fad. (66:5.9)
	the entire city was submerged, and the inhabitants headed north and east (77:3.1-2)
teachings
	The seven commandments of Dalamatia and Eden, as well as the ten injunctions of the Hebrews, were definite taboos, all expressed in the same negative form as were the most ancient prohibitions. (89:1.4)
	This expanding revelation of Deity went on for more than three hundred thousand years until it was suddenly terminated by the planetary secession and the disruption of the teaching regime. (92:4.5)
	it was the first epochal revelation. Except for the work of Van, the influence of the Dalamatian revelation was practically lost to the whole world. (92:4.5)
	One hundred and sixty-two years after the rebellion a tidal wave swept up over Dalamatia, and the planetary headquarters sank beneath the waters of the sea, and this land did not again emerge until almost every vestige of the noble culture of those splendid ages had been obliterated. Nonetheless there are vestiges under Persian Gulf (67:5.2,4) (77:4.7) (78:7.7)

dance; dances; dancing; dancers | | | | OK
Our ensembles of dancing undoubtedly represent a crude and grotesque attempt of material creatures to approach the celestial harmony of being placement and personality arrangement. (44:1.10)
wild dancing can induce a mystic state. But instead of mystical experiences the more healthful attitude of spiritual meditation is to be found in reflective worship and in the prayer of thanksgiving. (100:5.10)
among primitive man
	dance originated in seasonal worship festivals (92:3.6)
	initially prayers were acted out; magical dances were nothing but dramatic prayers. Religion was danced out rather than thought out. (88:6.3) (99:5.9)

in China
	Confucius and Lao-tse were eventually deified by their followers in those spiritually dark ages of China which intervened between the decline and perversion of the Taoist faith and the coming of the Buddhist missionaries from India. (94:6.12)
European dark ages
	Christianity comatose for 1000 years as a result of an overdose of mysteries and paganism. During so-called European “dark ages” religion became more and more monasticized, asceticized, and legalized. (195:4) (195:10.18)
	Few human rights were recognized in the European Middle Ages; then every man belonged to someone else. The revolt from this error was equally erroneous in that it led to the belief that all men are born equal. (70:9.15)
	During these dark ages the territorial state collapsed, and there was a reversion to the small castle groups, the reappearance of the clan and tribal stages of development. (71:1.24)
	Slavery demands strong regulation and during the European Middle Ages virtually disappeared because the feudal lords could not control the slaves. (69:8.7)

dark gravity bodies | | | PLACE | OK
The center and focal point of absolute material gravity is the Isle of Paradise, complemented by the dark gravity bodies encircling Havona and equilibrated by the upper and nether space reservoirs. (11:8.2)
The dark gravity bodies encircling Havona are neither triata nor gravita, and their drawing power discloses both forms of physical gravity, linear and absolute. (11:8.7)
Havona, the central universe, is surrounded by the enormous dark gravity bodies. Equalize the lines of Havona gravity as to render the central universe a physically balanced and perfectly stabilized creation. (12:1.10) (14:1.14-18)
These dark gravity bodies neither reflect nor absorb light (14:1.14)
The intervening space which exists between these two circuits of gravity bodies is unique in that nothing like it is to be found elsewhere in all the wide universe. (11:8.7) (14:1.17-18)
The dark gravity bodies form two belts located between the seven Havona circuits and the seven superuniverses. Surrounding the gravity bodies on the outside there are two semiquiet zones of space, and in the middle of the two belts of bodies there is a zone of space unique in its kind. (14:1.1,5-7,15-17)
Owing to the enormous encircling masses of the dark gravity bodies about the fringe of the central universe, the mass content of Havona is far in excess of the total known mass of all seven sectors of the grand universe. (12:1.10)
primary seconaphim take pilgrims past dark gravity bodies to Havona (26:4.11)

The Dark Islands of Space are the dead suns and other large aggregations of matter devoid of light and heat, enormous in mass. They function as powerful balance wheels, holding large neighboring systems in effective leash. They are locatable by their gravity effect. (15:6.11)
collisions of dead giants of sapce convert enormous masses into the rarest form of energy (15:8.6)
dark worlds and all outer space can slow down electronic and ultimatonic activity to the point of converting these energies into matter (42:4.9)
organized matter tends to disintegrate under certain conditions found in very hot stars and under certain peculiar conditions in space near highly energized cold bodies of condensed matter. (15:8.5)
the near approach of a sun to a dark island of space may give birth to a planetary system (15:5.5)
their origin may be due to: (15:5.10-11)
* by accretions of transmuting energy
* by accumulations of cold matter
* from burned-out suns 
Many of these dark islands are vast dynamos which mobilize and directionize certain space-energies, and are used by the Satania Power Center directing the streams of more materialized power to the Master Physical Controllers on the evolutionary planets of space. (41:1.5) (41:3.1)
Known giants
	The astronomic center of Satania is an enormous dark island of space which, with its attendant spheres, is situated not far from the headquarters of the system government. (41:2.2)

they gave rise to mid-mammals after 70 generations (61:6.1)(62:3.1)
When the numbers of this new and superior group grew great, war, relentless war, broke out; and when the terrible struggle was over, not a single individual of the pre-existent and ancestral race of dawn mammals remained alive. (62:3.4)
The immediate lemurlike mother of the dawn-mammal species escaped death no less than five times by mere hairbreadth margins before she gave birth to the father of the new and higher mammalian order. (62:3.9)

death; Death; die | | dead; death penalty; eternal life; judgment; assassination | | OK
among primitive man
	It was only by the concept of sin that natural death became logical to the primitive mind. Sin was the transgression of taboo, and death was the penalty of sin. (89:2.2)
	Death was feared because death meant the liberation of another ghost from its physical body. (86:5.2) (87:1.1)
	A house in which death had occurred was usually destroyed; if not, it was always avoided, and this fear prevented early man from building substantial dwellings. (87:1.3)

	after our death, our identity and the morontia entity of the human soul are faithfully conserved by the destiny guardian, that is our real you, except the identity of continuing existence represented by the departing Adjuster and the actuality of personality. (113:6)
	it would be decidedly helpful if we mortals could only learn to view natural death with something of more cheerfulness and lightheartedness. (55:2.5-6)
	It is easy to die in the line of physical battle when our courage is strengthened by the presence of our fighting comrades, but it requires a higher courage to lay down our life calmly and all alone for the love of a truth enshrined in our heart. (143:1.6)
	To the mortal consciousness there is no lapse of time after death; the resurrection of life follows the sleep of death as of the same instant. (112:3.7) (112:5.13) (168:2.5,9) (188:3.9)
	there is no death on Paradise an no transition sleep (27:1.5)

		death is only the beginning of an endless career of adventure, an everlasting life of anticipation, an eternal voyage of discovery. (14:5.10)
		Death is, ordinarily, a part of life. (20:6.7) (188:4.2)
		Mortal death is a technique of escape from the material life in the flesh (32:5.4) (47:10.7) (49:6)
		The second advent of Michael on earth is an event of tremendous sentimental value but it is of no immediate moment because deatch precipitates man to events which lead to this same Jesus (176:4.7)
spiritual death | extinction; nonsurvivors; roll call:of justice

	Adjuster proceeds to bosom of Father upon death (39:2.13)
	Adjuster is released after rejection of survival by the mortal associate; however the duties of the seraphim stay (112:3.2) (130:4.8)

	when a personality is nonsalvable the guardian angel responds to dispensational roll call, but Adjuster makes no answer, and that constitutes cessation of creature existence. (49:6.7) (113:6.8)
	Jesus warned of spiritual doom to the chief priests and religious leaders of his time (153:2.3)
	Man’s final doom is not sealed until he has lost the power to choose the Father’s will. (5:1.11)

death penalty; put to death; summary death | | justice | | OK
It was at one time not at all uncommon for ten innocent persons to be put to death because of supposed responsibility for one natural death. (88:4.7)
Treason—the “selling out” or betrayal of one’s tribal associates—was the first capital crime. Cattle stealing was universally punished by summary death, and even recently horse stealing has been similarly punished (70:10.15)
many ancient rulers, including Hammurabi and Moses, recognized that many crimes, particularly those of a grave sex nature, should be punished by burning at the stake. (70:10.14)
Moses prescribed death penalty for ghost cultists (92:5.11)
Romans denied Jews right to inflict death penalty without the approval of a Roman tribunal. (162:3.3)
Jesus declared that the state has the right of self-defense in the manner of its own choosing, even with death penalty (133:4.12)
in the most developed continental nation of a neighboring planet numerous crimes aside from murder, including betrayal of governmental trust, also carry the death penalty, and the visitation of justice is sure and swift. (72:10.1)

early creditors controlled body after death (69:5.8)
secret societies were employed by merchants to collect debts (70:7.18)
governments may not incur debt in continental nation that is the most developed in a neighboring planet (72:7.3,7)
Jesus gave two parables about debt:
* the parable of the moneylender, about what is the greatest love (147:5.4)
* the parable of the shrewd steward, on how one must show sagacity and friendship with eternal things to prepare for the future (169:2)

Decapolis | | Scythopolis | PLACE | OK
Amos the Kheresa lunatic did not stop until he had gone into all the cities of the Decapolis, declaring about Jesus (151:6.8)
Jesus, his twelve apostles, and the twelve apostles of John, preached on various occasions in the Greco-Roman cities of the Decapolis, notably Scythopolis, Gerasa, Abila, Gadara, Pella, Philadelphia, and Heshbon (128:3.2) (144:7.1) (123:5.12) (124:3.6-9)

Deccan | | India | PLACE | OK
About 15,000 B.C. increasing population pressure throughout Turkestan and Iran occasioned the first really extensive Andite movement toward India, slowly moving southward into the Deccan (79:2.4-5)
As the Salem missionaries penetrated southward into the Dravidian Deccan, they encountered an increasing caste system, the scheme of the Aryans to prevent loss of racial identity in the face of a rising tide of the secondary Sangik peoples. (94:2.1-2)
The Aryans made very little racial impression on India except in the northern provinces. In the Deccan their influence was cultural and religious more than racial. (79:4.3)
Hinduism became contaminated with a flood of degrading and debilitating cults and creeds from the Deccan (79:4.7) (94:2.5-6)
Dravidian culture has survived in Deccan to modern times (79:3.6,8)

Life Carriers experiment with new patterns on decimal planets, new patterns of mechanical, chemical, and electrical mobilization at the time of their subsequent arrival with life transplantation and implantation mandates. (57:8.7-9) (58:0.1)
On life-experiment worlds, life designs vary more than on other worlds. This happens in one world out of ten (36:2.15)
small dark planets are most suited to life experiments (23:2.20) (49:5.11)
Tabamantia is the inspector for experimental planets in Satania (49:5.12)
Urantia is sixtieth decimal planet in Satania. In all Satania there are only sixty-one worlds similar to Urantia. The two outstanding features have been: (36:2.15) (49:5.11) (57:8.7-10) (58:0.1) (65:4.7-9)
* the appearance of the Andonic race prior to the evolution of the six colored peoples
* the simultaneous appearance of the Sangik mutants in a single family
* Another outstanding variation of procedure was the late arrival of the Planetary Prince. 

decisions; decision | | consecration of choice; problem solving; spiritual rebirth; will | | OK
When man decides, and when he consummates this decision in action, man experiences (101:7.1) (117:5.13)
Effort and decision are an essential part of the acquirement of survival values. (50:6.3)
Man’s choosing between good and evil is influenced, not only by the keenness of his moral nature, but also by such influences as ignorance, immaturity, and delusion. (16:7.7)
Man’s moral nature would be impotent without the art of measurement, the discrimination embodied in his ability to scrutinize meanings. (16:7.8)
the very power of choice is the universe insignia of freewill creaturehood, that constitutes man’s greatest opportunity and his supreme cosmic responsibility. (112:5.5)
upon the steadfastness and wisdom of decision-actions the Supreme Being depends for the actuality of experiential evolution. (112:5.5)
“How long will you tarry in the valley of decision? the Father never compels any man to enter the kingdom. The invitation ever has been and always will be: Whosoever will, let him come and freely partake of the water of life (165:3.8)
Jesús
	It had always been Jesus’ practice, when facing any new or serious decisions, to withdraw for communion with his own spirit that he might seek to know the will of God. (136:4.10)
	Jesus’ great decisions were: (136:5-10)
	* he would not make use of any mighty personalities in connection with the ensuing program of his public work
	* he would not transcend the natual laws established. He chose a program of living which was the equivalent of deciding against miracles and wonders. 
	* He emphatically decided to continue on in just such implicit mortal dependence on the Father’s will. 
	* He chose to go on pursuing the policy of refusing to defend himself. His superhuman power he might possibly use for others, but for himself, never.
	* He made the decision not to meet the messianic expectations of the Jewish people
	* He decided to exercise normal watchcare over his human safety and to take reasonable precaution to prevent the untimely termination of his career
	* he should not in any manner lend his universe powers to the gratification of the Jewish hankering for the spectacular and the marvelous
	* he would not use his superior knowledge in politics and commerce, or short cuts, to advance his mission
	Philip faced the question of a lifetime when he had to make the decision of whether or not to follow Jesus. (137:2.4)
mortals
	Man consciously grows from the material toward the spiritual by the strength, power, and persistency of his own decisions (39:4.14) (117:3.6) (127:2.12)
	Man are so devoid of courageous decisions and consecrated co-operation that indwelling Adjusters find it next to impossible to communicate directly with the human mind. (110:4.5)
	Thus always it was and forever will be: Men must arrive at their own decisions. (163:2.8)
	Human beings below the third and second circles of attainment rarely hear the Adjuster’s direct voice except in moments of supreme desire (110:7.9)
celestial help
	Adjusters are not interested in making the mortal career easy; rather are they concerned in making our life reasonably difficult and rugged, so that decisions will be stimulated and multiplied. (108:5.5)
	decicions supply psychic fulcrum for Adjusters to apply a spiritual lever of uplifting and advancing illumination. (108:5.8)
	The spirit world is governed on the principle of respecting our freewill choice provided the course we may choose is not detrimental to we or injurious to our fellows. (48:6.6)
	The seraphim guard us; they do not seek directly to influence us; we must chart our own course, but angels then act to make the best possible use of the course we have chosen. (113:5.4)
result of decisions
	the supremacy of a decision, its crisis relationship, has a great deal to do with its circle-making influence (110:6.6)
	decisions open up new capacity for growth (115:3.16)
	moral decisions causes divine invasion of soul (196:3.20)
	numbers of decisions, frequent repetitions, persistent repetitions, are also essential to the habit-forming certainty of such reactions. (110:6.6)
	the functioning presence of subabsolute and experiential Deity is definitely and directly influenced by the decisions, choices, and will-attitudes of such finite creature beings (13:4.4-5)
