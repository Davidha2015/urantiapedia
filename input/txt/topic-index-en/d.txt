Dalamatia; Dalamatian | | Caligastia; Caligastia one hundred | PLACE | OK
Dalamatia was the city that was built in the distant past to house the headquarters of the Planetary Prince. It was located in the Persian Gulf region, in the area corresponding to later Mesopotamia. (66:3)
This world center of culture was named Dalamatia in honor of Daligastia. (66:3.3)
it was a very simple but beautiful city, enclosed within a wall 40 feet high. (66:3.3) (66:4.10)
The country around the city was quite well settled within a radius of 100 miles. (66:7.18)
the residential buildings were models of neatness and cleanliness, everything was very simple and altogether primitive, built of brick (66:3.5-6) (66:7.1-3)
The land provision within the city walls was sufficient to provide for pasturage and gardening for the support of a population of about 20,000. (66:7.1)
the law of Dalamatia for almost 300,000 years was the code known as “The Father’s Way” and consisted of the following seven commands: (66:7.8-16)
# You shall not fear nor serve any God but the Father of all.
# You shall not disobey the Father’s Son
# You shall not speak a lie
# You shall not kill men
# You shall not steal
# You shall not touch your friend’s wife.
# You shall not show disrespect to your parents
The definite order of family life and the living of one family together in one residence of comparatively settled location date from these times of Dalamatia (66:7)
life in Dalamatia was far from being utopian (68:1.7)
Although the races were at war, they lived together in harmony near the seat of the Prince (64:6.28)
the rebellion
	At the outbreak of the rebellion, Dalamatia had a resident population of almost 6000. (66:7.20)
	it was attacked by hordes of semisavages after the rebellion, who besieged its walls and drove out its inhabitants (67:5.2)
	Great confusion reigned in Dalamatia and thereabout for almost fifty years after the instigation of rebellion. (67:5.1)
	The Dalamatia library, destroyed soon after the Caligastia disaffection, comprised more than two million separate records and was known as the “house of Fad. (66:5.9)
	the entire city was submerged, and the inhabitants headed north and east (77:3.1-2)
teachings
	The seven commandments of Dalamatia and Eden, as well as the ten injunctions of the Hebrews, were definite taboos, all expressed in the same negative form as were the most ancient prohibitions. (89:1.4)
	This expanding revelation of Deity went on for more than three hundred thousand years until it was suddenly terminated by the planetary secession and the disruption of the teaching regime. (92:4.5)
	it was the first epochal revelation. Except for the work of Van, the influence of the Dalamatian revelation was practically lost to the whole world. (92:4.5)
	One hundred and sixty-two years after the rebellion a tidal wave swept up over Dalamatia, and the planetary headquarters sank beneath the waters of the sea, and this land did not again emerge until almost every vestige of the noble culture of those splendid ages had been obliterated. Nonetheless there are vestiges under Persian Gulf (67:5.2,4) (77:4.7) (78:7.7)

dance; dances; dancing; dancers | | | | OK
Our ensembles of dancing undoubtedly represent a crude and grotesque attempt of material creatures to approach the celestial harmony of being placement and personality arrangement. (44:1.10)
wild dancing can induce a mystic state. But instead of mystical experiences the more healthful attitude of spiritual meditation is to be found in reflective worship and in the prayer of thanksgiving. (100:5.10)
among primitive man
	dance originated in seasonal worship festivals (92:3.6)
	initially prayers were acted out; magical dances were nothing but dramatic prayers. Religion was danced out rather than thought out. (88:6.3) (99:5.9)

in China
	Confucius and Lao-tse were eventually deified by their followers in those spiritually dark ages of China which intervened between the decline and perversion of the Taoist faith and the coming of the Buddhist missionaries from India. (94:6.12)
European dark ages
	Christianity comatose for 1000 years as a result of an overdose of mysteries and paganism. During so-called European “dark ages” religion became more and more monasticized, asceticized, and legalized. (195:4) (195:10.18)
	Few human rights were recognized in the European Middle Ages; then every man belonged to someone else. The revolt from this error was equally erroneous in that it led to the belief that all men are born equal. (70:9.15)
	During these dark ages the territorial state collapsed, and there was a reversion to the small castle groups, the reappearance of the clan and tribal stages of development. (71:1.24)
	Slavery demands strong regulation and during the European Middle Ages virtually disappeared because the feudal lords could not control the slaves. (69:8.7)

dark gravity bodies | | | PLACE | OK
The center and focal point of absolute material gravity is the Isle of Paradise, complemented by the dark gravity bodies encircling Havona and equilibrated by the upper and nether space reservoirs. (11:8.2)
The dark gravity bodies encircling Havona are neither triata nor gravita, and their drawing power discloses both forms of physical gravity, linear and absolute. (11:8.7)
Havona, the central universe, is surrounded by the enormous dark gravity bodies. Equalize the lines of Havona gravity as to render the central universe a physically balanced and perfectly stabilized creation. (12:1.10) (14:1.14-18)
These dark gravity bodies neither reflect nor absorb light (14:1.14)
The intervening space which exists between these two circuits of gravity bodies is unique in that nothing like it is to be found elsewhere in all the wide universe. (11:8.7) (14:1.17-18)
The dark gravity bodies form two belts located between the seven Havona circuits and the seven superuniverses. Surrounding the gravity bodies on the outside there are two semiquiet zones of space, and in the middle of the two belts of bodies there is a zone of space unique in its kind. (14:1.1,5-7,15-17)
Owing to the enormous encircling masses of the dark gravity bodies about the fringe of the central universe, the mass content of Havona is far in excess of the total known mass of all seven sectors of the grand universe. (12:1.10)
primary seconaphim take pilgrims past dark gravity bodies to Havona (26:4.11)

The Dark Islands of Space are the dead suns and other large aggregations of matter devoid of light and heat, enormous in mass. They function as powerful balance wheels, holding large neighboring systems in effective leash. They are locatable by their gravity effect. (15:6.11)
collisions of dead giants of sapce convert enormous masses into the rarest form of energy (15:8.6)
dark worlds and all outer space can slow down electronic and ultimatonic activity to the point of converting these energies into matter (42:4.9)
organized matter tends to disintegrate under certain conditions found in very hot stars and under certain peculiar conditions in space near highly energized cold bodies of condensed matter. (15:8.5)
the near approach of a sun to a dark island of space may give birth to a planetary system (15:5.5)
their origin may be due to: (15:5.10-11)
* by accretions of transmuting energy
* by accumulations of cold matter
* from burned-out suns 
Many of these dark islands are vast dynamos which mobilize and directionize certain space-energies, and are used by the Satania Power Center directing the streams of more materialized power to the Master Physical Controllers on the evolutionary planets of space. (41:1.5) (41:3.1)
Known giants
	The astronomic center of Satania is an enormous dark island of space which, with its attendant spheres, is situated not far from the headquarters of the system government. (41:2.2)

they gave rise to mid-mammals after 70 generations (61:6.1)(62:3.1)
When the numbers of this new and superior group grew great, war, relentless war, broke out; and when the terrible struggle was over, not a single individual of the pre-existent and ancestral race of dawn mammals remained alive. (62:3.4)
The immediate lemurlike mother of the dawn-mammal species escaped death no less than five times by mere hairbreadth margins before she gave birth to the father of the new and higher mammalian order. (62:3.9)

death; Death; die | | dead; death penalty; eternal life; judgment; assassination | | OK
among primitive man
	It was only by the concept of sin that natural death became logical to the primitive mind. Sin was the transgression of taboo, and death was the penalty of sin. (89:2.2)
	Death was feared because death meant the liberation of another ghost from its physical body. (86:5.2) (87:1.1)
	A house in which death had occurred was usually destroyed; if not, it was always avoided, and this fear prevented early man from building substantial dwellings. (87:1.3)

	after our death, our identity and the morontia entity of the human soul are faithfully conserved by the destiny guardian, that is our real you, except the identity of continuing existence represented by the departing Adjuster and the actuality of personality. (113:6)
	it would be decidedly helpful if we mortals could only learn to view natural death with something of more cheerfulness and lightheartedness. (55:2.5-6)
	It is easy to die in the line of physical battle when our courage is strengthened by the presence of our fighting comrades, but it requires a higher courage to lay down our life calmly and all alone for the love of a truth enshrined in our heart. (143:1.6)
	To the mortal consciousness there is no lapse of time after death; the resurrection of life follows the sleep of death as of the same instant. (112:3.7) (112:5.13) (168:2.5,9) (188:3.9)
	there is no death on Paradise an no transition sleep (27:1.5)

		death is only the beginning of an endless career of adventure, an everlasting life of anticipation, an eternal voyage of discovery. (14:5.10)
		Death is, ordinarily, a part of life. (20:6.7) (188:4.2)
		Mortal death is a technique of escape from the material life in the flesh (32:5.4) (47:10.7) (49:6)
		The second advent of Michael on earth is an event of tremendous sentimental value but it is of no immediate moment because deatch precipitates man to events which lead to this same Jesus (176:4.7)
spiritual death | extinction; nonsurvivors; roll call:of justice

	when a personality is nonsalvable the guardian angel responds to dispensational roll call, but Adjuster makes no answer, and that constitutes cessation of creature existence. (49:6.7) (113:6.8)
	Jesus warned of spiritual doom to the chief priests and religious leaders of his time (153:2.3)
	Man’s final doom is not sealed until he has lost the power to choose the Father’s will. (5:1.11)

It was at one time not at all uncommon for ten innocent persons to be put to death because of supposed responsibility for one natural death. (88:4.7)
Treason—the “selling out” or betrayal of one’s tribal associates—was the first capital crime. Cattle stealing was universally punished by summary death, and even recently horse stealing has been similarly punished (70:10.15)
many ancient rulers, including Hammurabi and Moses, recognized that many crimes, particularly those of a grave sex nature, should be punished by burning at the stake. (70:10.14)
Moses prescribed death penalty for ghost cultists (92:5.11)
Romans denied Jews right to inflict death penalty without the approval of a Roman tribunal. (162:3.3)
Jesus declared that the state has the right of self-defense in the manner of its own choosing, even with death penalty (133:4.12)
in the most developed continental nation of a neighboring planet numerous crimes aside from murder, including betrayal of governmental trust, also carry the death penalty, and the visitation of justice is sure and swift. (72:10.1)

governments may not incur debt in continental nation that is the most developed in a neighboring planet (72:7.3,7)
Jesus gave two parables about debt:

Deccan | | India | PLACE | OK
About 15,000 B.C. increasing population pressure throughout Turkestan and Iran occasioned the first really extensive Andite movement toward India, slowly moving southward into the Deccan (79:2.4-5)
As the Salem missionaries penetrated southward into the Dravidian Deccan, they encountered an increasing caste system, the scheme of the Aryans to prevent loss of racial identity in the face of a rising tide of the secondary Sangik peoples. (94:2.1-2)
The Aryans made very little racial impression on India except in the northern provinces. In the Deccan their influence was cultural and religious more than racial. (79:4.3)
Hinduism became contaminated with a flood of degrading and debilitating cults and creeds from the Deccan (79:4.7) (94:2.5-6)
Dravidian culture has survived in Deccan to modern times (79:3.6,8)

decisions; decision | | consecration of choice; problem solving; spiritual rebirth; will | | OK
When man decides, and when he consummates this decision in action, man experiences (101:7.1) (117:5.13)
Effort and decision are an essential part of the acquirement of survival values. (50:6.3)
Man’s choosing between good and evil is influenced, not only by the keenness of his moral nature, but also by such influences as ignorance, immaturity, and delusion. (16:7.7)
Man’s moral nature would be impotent without the art of measurement, the discrimination embodied in his ability to scrutinize meanings. (16:7.8)
the very power of choice is the universe insignia of freewill creaturehood, that constitutes man’s greatest opportunity and his supreme cosmic responsibility. (112:5.5)
upon the steadfastness and wisdom of decision-actions the Supreme Being depends for the actuality of experiential evolution. (112:5.5)
“How long will you tarry in the valley of decision? the Father never compels any man to enter the kingdom. The invitation ever has been and always will be: Whosoever will, let him come and freely partake of the water of life (165:3.8)
Jesús
	It had always been Jesus’ practice, when facing any new or serious decisions, to withdraw for communion with his own spirit that he might seek to know the will of God. (136:4.10)
	Jesus’ great decisions were: (136:5-10)
	* he would not make use of any mighty personalities in connection with the ensuing program of his public work
	* he would not transcend the natual laws established. He chose a program of living which was the equivalent of deciding against miracles and wonders. 
	* He emphatically decided to continue on in just such implicit mortal dependence on the Father’s will. 
	* He chose to go on pursuing the policy of refusing to defend himself. His superhuman power he might possibly use for others, but for himself, never.
	* He made the decision not to meet the messianic expectations of the Jewish people
	* He decided to exercise normal watchcare over his human safety and to take reasonable precaution to prevent the untimely termination of his career
	* he should not in any manner lend his universe powers to the gratification of the Jewish hankering for the spectacular and the marvelous
	* he would not use his superior knowledge in politics and commerce, or short cuts, to advance his mission
	Philip faced the question of a lifetime when he had to make the decision of whether or not to follow Jesus. (137:2.4)
mortals
	Man consciously grows from the material toward the spiritual by the strength, power, and persistency of his own decisions (39:4.14) (117:3.6) (127:2.12)
	Man are so devoid of courageous decisions and consecrated co-operation that indwelling Adjusters find it next to impossible to communicate directly with the human mind. (110:4.5)
	Thus always it was and forever will be: Men must arrive at their own decisions. (163:2.8)
	Human beings below the third and second circles of attainment rarely hear the Adjuster’s direct voice except in moments of supreme desire (110:7.9)
celestial help
	Adjusters are not interested in making the mortal career easy; rather are they concerned in making our life reasonably difficult and rugged, so that decisions will be stimulated and multiplied. (108:5.5)
	decicions supply psychic fulcrum for Adjusters to apply a spiritual lever of uplifting and advancing illumination. (108:5.8)
	The spirit world is governed on the principle of respecting our freewill choice provided the course we may choose is not detrimental to we or injurious to our fellows. (48:6.6)
	The seraphim guard us; they do not seek directly to influence us; we must chart our own course, but angels then act to make the best possible use of the course we have chosen. (113:5.4)
result of decisions
	the supremacy of a decision, its crisis relationship, has a great deal to do with its circle-making influence (110:6.6)
	decisions open up new capacity for growth (115:3.16)
	moral decisions causes divine invasion of soul (196:3.20)
	numbers of decisions, frequent repetitions, persistent repetitions, are also essential to the habit-forming certainty of such reactions. (110:6.6)
	the functioning presence of subabsolute and experiential Deity is definitely and directly influenced by the decisions, choices, and will-attitudes of such finite creature beings (13:4.4-5)

If an ascending mortal should reach the central universe alone and, while traversing Havona, should fail in some phase of the Deity adventure, the pilgrim would be remanded to universes with seraphic guardian or Paradise Companion (25:8.9-11) (26:3.9)
prudence and discretion, when carried too far, lead to cowardice and failure. (149:4.4)
do not be troubled with doubts of failure or by perplexing confusion (34:7.8)
Success may generate courage and promote confidence, but wisdom comes only from the experiences of adjustment to the results of one’s failures.  (160:4.14-16)
before reaching Havona, ascendant children have learned to feast upon uncertainty, to fatten upon disappointment, to enthuse over apparent defeat, to invigorate in the presence of difficulties, to exhibit indomitable courage in the face of immensity, and to exercise unconquerable faith when confronted with the challenge of the inexplicable. (26:5.3)
apparent failures in reality are simply unescapable delays. (26:8.4)
friendship lessens sting of defeat. Difficulties, sorrow, disappointment, and defeat are more painful and disheartening when borne alone. (160:2.9)
life will become a burden of existence unless we learn how to fail gracefully. There is an art in defeat which noble souls always acquire; we must know how to lose cheerfully (160:4.13)
the times of great testing and threatened defeat are always times of great revelation. (195:9.3)
Defeat is the true mirror in which you may honestly view your real self. (156:5.17)
Faith produces a sublime trust in the goodness of God even in the face of bitter disappointment and crushing defeat. (101:3.6)
Rise again
	in mansion worlds, after failures, we will asked:  If you fail, will you rise indomitably to try anew? (48:6.35)
	Religious insight possesses the power of turning defeat into higher desires and new determinations. (196:3.29)
Jesus and Judas
	Jesus became experienced in the skillful wresting of victory from the very jaws of defeat; he learnt how to transform the difficulties of time into the triumphs of eternity. (127:6.12)
	Jesus’ humanity was not insensible to this situation of private loneliness, public shame, and the appearance of the failure of his cause. (182:3.10)
	Jesus was untouched by apparent failure. (100:7.7)
	Jesus' words to Fortune, the young downcast, were: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man! Your mind should be your courageous ally in the solution of your life problems rather than your being, as you have been, its abject fear-slave and the bond servant of depression and defeat”. (130:6)
	Judas refused to entertain the idea of apparent failure. (177:4.3)
	Judas bitterly resented thwarting. He always expected to win; he was a very poor loser. (193:4.6)

defectives | | inferiors | | OK

defilement | | ceremonies:purification ceremonies | | OK
for the Jews one could incur defilement:
* by contact with the dead, as in the case of Nazirite vows, which required purification (135:1.1) (135:2.1)
* entering a Gentile building before Passover (185:0.3-4)
There was also a Mosaic ordinance which directed that a mother, after the passing of a certain period of time, should present herself, or have someone make the proper sacrifice for her, at the temple for purification. (84:4.6) (122:9.1) (122:10.2)
Greeks held the menstruating woman as one of the three great causes of defilement, the other two being pork and garlic. (84:4.8)
For Jesus man is only defiled by that evil which may originate within the heart, and which finds expression in the words and deeds of such unholy persons. (153:3.5)

Deity | | Eternal Son; God; Infinite Spirit; Universal Father; gods and goddesses | | OK
Deity functions on personal, prepersonal, and superpersonal levels. Total Deity is functional on the following seven levels: (0:1.3-10,14)
# Static
# Potential
# Associative
# Creative
# Evolutional
# Supreme
# Ultimate
the Seven Master Spirits are hardly expressive of threefold Deity, they are the eternal portrayal of sevenfold Deity, the active and associative functions of the three ever-existent persons of Deity. (16:1.1-2)
In considering the genesis of reality, we must bear in mind that all absolute reality is from eternity and is without beginning of existence. By absolute reality we must refer to the three existential persons of Deity, the Isle of Paradise, and the three Absolutes. These seven realities are co-ordinately eternal (105)
Deity presence absolute only on upper Paradise (11:3.1) (56:9.7)
description
	Although Divinity may be plural in manifestation, in human experience Deity is singular, always one. (34:6.2)
	Deity is unity, existential in the Trinity, experiential in the Supreme, and, in mortals, creature-realized in Adjuster fusion. (117:3.9)
	Deity is unity, and the unity of Deity not only embraces the spiritual values of the Universal Father and the Eternal Son but is also cognizant of the energy facts (0:2.10) (103:7.3)
	the different natures of Deity are: the Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Supreme, the Sevenfold, the Ultimate, and the Absolute (118:0.1-8)
	Deity is personalizable as God, is prepersonal and superpersonal in ways not altogether comprehensible by man and is characterized by the quality of unity, quality that is best comprehended as divinity. (0:1.2,16) (0:1.15) (56:5)
	Deity is the source of all that which is divine. (0:1.15)
	Supreme is the maximum of Deity that creatures can understand (56:6.3) (56:8.1)
	truth, beauty, and goodness are revelation of Deity, the comprehensible elements of Deity (56:10.2,9)
	Deity is the transcendental, even the infinite, goal of universal and eternal attainment. (56:10.16)
	The equivalent of mind, the ability to know and be known, is indigenous to Deity. (6:6.2)
existential Deities
	Notwithstanding there is only one Deity, there are three positive and divine personalizations of Deity: Universal Father, Eternal Son, and Infinite Spirit (3:6.8) (10:3) (56:5.1) (56:7.3)
	the Father is not discernibly absolute as total Deity except in the Paradise Trinity. (0:7.1-6) (10:3.7,8,16) (117:3.9)
	master circuits of the grand universe derive from personality presences of Paradise Deities (34:4.5)
	Physical matter is the time-space shadow of the Paradise energy-shining of the absolute Deities. (56:10.18)
	Whereas absolute and existential Deity is in no manner whatever influenced by attitudes of loyalty or disloyalty of created beings, subabsolute and experiential Deity is definitely and directly influenced by the loyalties of finite creatures. (13:4.3-5)
	task of Havona pilgrims is spiritual and personality recognition of Deities (26:7.5)
	While no single person of the Paradise Deities fills all Deity potential, collectively all three do, as three seem to be the minimum number of beings required to activate the prepersonal and existential potential of total Deity—the Deity Absolute. (10:8.4)
	In the universe of universes Paradise and its Deities transcend both time and space. (130:7.4)
	God as a Father takes precedence over all other phases of Deity manifestation in all the dealings of divinity with humanity. (54:6.2)
	The Universal Father, the Eternal Son, and the Infinite Spirit are, in a certain sense, the constituent personalities of total Deity. Their union in the Paradise Trinity and the absolute function of the Trinity equivalate to the function of total Deity. (10:8.3-4)
experiential Deities
	associate evolutionary Deities of the three Deities of Paradise are: God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and possibly God the Absolute (0:9.4)
	The first and second experiential Trinities, the post-Havona Trinities, cannot be infinite because they embrace derived Deities, Deities evolved (0:12.3)
	The steady progress of evolution in the time-space universes is accompanied by ever-enlarging revelations of Deity to all intelligent creatures. (56:7.1,2,5)
	The Father has achieved existential Deity expression of himself in the Son and the Spirit, and now is achieving experiential expression on hitherto impersonal and unrevealed deity levels as God the Supreme, God the Ultimate, and God the Absolute. (0:7.6)
	overcontrol by experiential Deities causes phenomena of their activities to be unpredictable (15:8.9)
	their presence is influenced by creature loyalty (13:4.4-5)
	the unity of the existential Deities translates into a unifying power potential of the sovereignty of experiential supremacy, the unification of the evolutionary Deity (56:6)
Direct descendants from the Deities
	fragmented Deity entities, such as Thought Adjusters, appear in the Paradise classification of beings; and there are many other unrevealed types of fragmentations (30:1.100-102)
	in the Paradise classification there exist unrevealed beings of direct Deity origin (30:1.23,24,63)
Nature of Deity
	the nature of Deity can be described by these characteristics:
	* Beauty | beauty
	* Goodness | goodness
	* Justice | justice: divine justice
	* Love | love: divine love
	* Mercy | mercy
	* Omnipotence | omnipotence
	* Omniscience | omniscience
	* Truth | truth
	The energy and material repercussions of the acts of Deity could hardly be called Deity. Paradise is not Deity (11:9.4)
Personalization of Deity
	Deity personalization culminated in the Infinite Spirit. First the Father donated the fullness of himself to the personality of his Son, and then both called upon the infinite power of their Father-Son union to bestow the qualities and attributes of a conjoint personality, the Infinite Spirit. (10:2-4)
	realities of Deity seek realization in personalization (0:12.4)
	the threefold personalization of Deity was the absolute inevitability, while the appearance of the Seven Master Spirits was the subabsolute inevitability. (16:1.1)
Approach to the Deity
	the Universal Father has established the evolutionary creature’s sevenfold approach to Deity: (0:8.1-8)
	# The Paradise Creator Sons.
	# The Ancients of Days.
	# The Seven Master Spirits.
	# The Supreme Being.

	The Deity Absolute is experiential in actualization but existential in potentiality. (0:7.5)
	the experiential Trinities culminate in the experiential personalization of the Deity Absolute (56:9.5)
	he is called Infinite Potential or I AM self-qualified (105:2.9)
	he is limitless, timeless, spaceless, boundless, and measureless—truly infinite. (106:7.3,9)
	he is not the equivalent of the Infinite (0:10.1)
	The Deity Absolute is that potential which was segregated from total, infinite reality by the freewill choice of the Universal Father, and within which all divinity activities—existential and experiential—take place. (0:3.16) (0:11.5-6) (10:8.4) (105:3.6)
	The Deity Absolute is the Qualified Absolute, within which all divinity activities—existential and experiential—take place.  (0:11.6)
	The Unqualified Absolute and the Deity Absolute are unified in the Universal Absolute. (0:3.18) (0:11.3) (56:1.2) (56:9.1)
	There are things still unknown: Is the Unqualified Absolute a force presence independent of the Trinity? Does the presence of the Deity Absolute connote the unlimited function of the Trinity? and is the Universal Absolute the final function of the Trinity, even a Trinity of Trinities? (56:9.3)
description
	God the Absolute is becoming experientializing God but now is existential as the Deity Absolute. (0:2.18)
	Deity Absolute is member of triodity of potentiality (104:5.7)
	he is member of Third and Sixth Triunity (104:4.16-19,34-37)
	overcontrols all material reality (56:1.2)
	he has reactions hardly personal, unfathomable unpredictable (7:1.9) (12:6.6-7)
	the Eternal Son and the Deity Absolute appear to be related in the following way: The Eternal Son dominates the realm of actual spiritual values, whereas the Deity Absolute seems to pervade the vast domain of potential spirit values. (7:1.9-10)
	Every response of Deity Absolute appears to be made in terms of the welfare of the whole creation of things and beings, not only in its present state of existence, but also in view of the infinite possibilities of all future eternity. (0:11.5)
	It seems likely that Universal Censors are in some manner in liaison with the Deity Absolute (19:4.7)
	Majeston was created by a new and far-reaching reaction occurred in the Deity Absolute (17:2.2-6) (106:8.20)
	The Deity Absolute response to the creation of Majeston by the Supreme Being and his associates was vastly beyond their purposeful intent and greatly in excess of their conceptual forecasts. (17:2.5)
	Spirit seems to emerge from the potentials of the Deity Absolute (6:5.2) (7:1.10-11) (7:2.1)
	The Absolute Trinity functions even to the borders of the nonpersonal, and its unification in universality would experientialize Absolute Deity. (0:12.7) (106:5.1)

delay; delays; postponement | | patience | | OK
Shortsighted and time-bound mortal minds should be slow to criticize the time delays of the farseeing and all-wise administrators of universe affairs. (54:6.8)
On Paradise, disappointment is never regarded as defeat; postponement is never looked upon as disgrace; the apparent failures of time are never confused with the significant delays of eternity. (26:8.3-4)
The mansonia life early teaches the young morontia pupils that postponement is in no sense avoidance. (48:5.8)
wisdom of delay
	between reasons for delay are: (54:4-5)
	# Mercy requires that every wrongdoer have sufficient time in which to formulate a deliberate and fully chosen attitude
	# Supreme justice is dominated by a Father’s love
	# No affectionate father is ever precipitate in visiting punishment
	# wisdom and love admonish the upright children to bear with an erring brother
	# it is required an unqualified sovereignty to exercise summary jurisdiction
	# The Ancients of Days seldom execute wrongdoers without a full hearing.
	# it is better to stay away from the rebels and allow the rebellion to take its natural course of self-destruction
	# it is better to allow the rebels free course to the end that all sympathy for these evildoers should be the sooner uprooted in the heart
	# it is needed to foster full opportunity for every living creature to mature a deliberate choice in any matter
	# full disclosure and unlimited opportunity for sin-expression is the quickest technique of achieving the perfect and final cure of the plague of evil and sin.
	# at least three times the number of beings are led astray if arbitrary or summary methods of suppression are attempted.
	# Time, even in a universe of time, is relative. Sometimes time is shorter than we think

dematerialization; dematerializing | | seraphic, secoraphic, and superaphic transport | | OK
on Jerusem there is a series of laboratories wherein the transport seraphim transform material beings into a state quite like that of the morontia order of existence. (46:5.26)
While there is this dematerializing technique for preparing the Adams for transit from Jerusem to the evolutionary worlds, there is no equivalent method for taking them away from such worlds unless the entire planet is to be emptied, in which event emergency installation of the dematerialization technique is made for the entire salvable population. (51:2.3)
Adam and Eve dematerialized on Jerusem, being seen off by their children, falling asleep and waking up when they were rematerialized on Urantia, ten days after their arrival (74:0.1) (74:1.5)
the body of Jesus was dematerialized by archangels and other helpers through near-instantaneous dissolution (189:2.1-4)

disharmonious spirits only existed after Caligastic rebellion (87:4.7)
The Jewish traditions of heaven and hell and the doctrine of devils were principally derived from the Zoroastrians during the times when the Jews were under the political and cultural dominance of the Persians. (95:6.6)
in olden times anything abnormal was ascribed to spirit possession, any striking mental or physical abnormality constituted qualification for being a medicine man. (90:1.2)
there was a time in which the belief that physical sickness and mental derangement could be caused by the dwelling of a so-called unclean spirit in the mind or body of the afflicted person was well-nigh universal. (121:7.12) (148:2.3)
Caligastia has absolutely no power to enter the minds of men, neither can he draw near to their souls to tempt or corrupt them unless they really desire to be cursed with his wicked presence. (53:8.6-9)
Jesus and demons
	When the seventy related how “even the devils were subject” to them, they referred to the wonderful cures they had wrought in the cases of victims of nervous disorders. Nevertheless, there had been a few cases of real spirit possession relieved by these ministers (163:6.2)
	Jesus really cast out demons in Capernaum (153:4.1)
	Amos, the Kheresa lunatic, was not possessed, he just had a nervous disorder, and no spirits supposedly entered the swine (151:6.6)
	James of Safed’s son was afflicted with epilepsy and at the same time was possessed by a real mischievous midwayer (158:4.2) (158:5)
	Norana the Syrian woman believed her daughter was possessed but she only was afflicted by a grievous nervous disorder (156:1)
confusion after Pentecost
	There has never been any possesion after arrival of Spirit of Truth (53:8.7) (77:7.4-8) (87:4.7) (141:4.4-8) (145:2.13) (146:7.1) (153:4.1) (163:6.2)
	The supposed casting out of devils since the arrival of the Spirit of Truth has been a matter of confounding a belief in demoniacal possession with hysteria, insanity, and feeble-mindedness. (77:7.6-7) (141:4.8) (145:2.12-14)
	Even prior to Pentecost no rebel spirit could dominate a normal human mind, and since that day even the weak minds of inferior mortals are free from such possibilities. (77:7.7)
	Long after the day of Pentecost the Apostle John, who was the last to write of Jesus’ doings, avoided all reference to these so-called acts of “casting out devils,” and this he did in view of the fact that such cases of demon possession never occurred after Pentecost. (145:2.13)
	In general, when weak and dissolute mortals are supposed to be under the influence of devils and demons, they are merely being dominated by their own inherent and debased tendencies, being led away by their own natural propensities. (53:8.9)
	rebel midwayers are now interned, held prisoner (51:3.7) (77:7.8)

density | | | | OK
the circuits of dark gravity bodies that surround Havona exhibit an equal density (14:1.16)
observation of the Milky Way reveals a higher density of stars when Orvonton is viewed in a certain direction. If we look in the direction of maximum density, we are looking towards Paradise (15:3.3)
The Dark Islands of Space are bodies with an incredible density (15:6.11)
Some of the reddish, faintly glimmering stars have acquired a density at the centre of their enormous masses which would be expressed by saying that 1 cm3 of such a star, if on Urantia, would weigh 166 kg. (41:3.6) | sun (Urantia’s); suns
The mass of your sun is slightly greater than the estimate of your physicists, who have reckoned it as about 2×10^30 kg. It now exists about halfway between the most dense and the most diffuse stars, having about 1.5 times the density of water. (41:4.1)
nonsolid suns can attain a density equal to iron — about the same as Urantia. Most of the suns, however, are not so dense. One of our nearer neighbours has a density equal to that of our atmosphere, and Veluntia, one of the largest in Orvonton, has a density only 0.001 that of Urantia’s atmosphere. (41:4.3-6)
The lava layers of the earth’s crust, when cooled, form granite. The average density of Urantia is a little more than 5.5 times that of water; the density of granite is less than 3 times that of water. The earth’s core is 12 times as dense as water. (58:5.5)

Believers are immune to the depression consequent upon purely material upheavals (156:5.13)
we must shake off depression and go forth to proclaim the gospel with great energy, never forgetting that Jesus was with us throughout our season of discouragement, and will continue with us to the end. (181:2.11)
the words to Fortune, the young downcast, were: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man! Your mind should be your courageous ally in the solution of your life problems rather than your being, as you have been, its abject fear-slave and the bond servant of depression and defeat”. (130:6) (130:6)
Thomas the apostle was afflicted by depression. When he was most depressed, unfortunately he always tried to avoid coming in direct contact with Jesus. (139:8.10-11)

Van had to face many desertion in the workers who prepared the Garden of Eden (73:4.5)
after the episode in which the crowd tried to proclaim Jesus as king, the disappointment caused by Jesus was so great that many of the followers turned back and followed him no more from that day (152:3)
If loyalty is desirable then must man carry on amid the possibilities of betrayal and desertion. (3:5.12)

Nameless despair is man’s only reward for living and toiling under the temporal sun of mortal existence. (102:0.1-2)
Jesus' words to Fortune, the young downcast, were: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man! Your mind should be your courageous ally in the solution of your life problems rather than your being, as you have been, its abject fear-slave and the bond servant of depression and defeat”. (130:6)

destiny; destinies | (40:10) | goals; providence | | OK
History alone fails adequately to reveal future development, destiny. (19:1.11)
mortal destiny
	as we gain mental attunement to the Adjuster, he becomes more and more able to record his picturizations of destiny in our evolving consciousness. (110:6.5) (111:7.2)
	Man’s true destiny consists in the creation of new and spirit goals and then in responding to the cosmic allurements of such supernal goals of nonmaterial value. (12:9.1)
	The destiny of eternity is determined moment by moment by the achievements of the day by day living. (48:7.26)
	our destiny is an endless unfolding of an almost infinite panorama, a limitless expanding of never-ending, ever-widening spheres of opportunity for exhilarating service, matchless adventure, sublime uncertainty, and boundless attainment. (108:6.8)
	Spirit identification constitutes the secret of personal survival and determines the destiny of spiritual ascension.  (40:5.4)
	the final destiny of all personalities is the final knowing of the Universal Father of these selfsame personalities. (106:8.22)
	Man is most truly the architect of his own eternal destiny. (70:1.16) (103:5.10)
	When mortal man fuses with an actual fragment of the existential Cause of the total cosmos, no limit can ever be placed upon the destiny of such an unprecedented and unimaginable partnership. (32:3.8) (107:4.7)
	Mortals, morontians, spirits, finaliters, Transcendentalers, and others, together with the universes themselves and all other phases of reality, certainly do have a potentially final destiny that is absolute in value; but it is not clear that any being or universe will ever completely attain all of the aspects of such a destiny. (106:7.4)
	progression of survivors is as follows: (14:5.1,4) (31:10.20)
	# On Urantia we pass through a short and intense test
	# On the mansion worlds and up through the system, constellation, and local universe, we traverse the morontia phases of ascension.
	# On worlds of the superuniverse we pass through the true spirit stages of progression
	# On the seven circuits of Havona our attainment is intellectual, spiritual, and experiential. 
	to know our destiny we must study history from the point of view of the source of Paradise (19:1.5-12)
From a practical viewpoint the philosophers of the universe have come to the conclusion that there is no such thing as an end. (115:3.17-18)
That mortal destinies do vary in no wise proves that one is necessarily greater or lesser than another, merely that they differ. (40:10.5)
personal beings may accept or reject their destiny (112:5.1)
universe destiny
	beyond doubt, the next age, the age of the first outer space level, will release the superuniverses from the destiny limitations of the present age. (106:0.18)
	The parterships of Deities will bring the completion of the cycle of reality: The Father-Son partnership has become Son-Spirit and then Spirit-Supreme and on to Supreme-Ultimate and Ultimate-Absolute, even to Absolute and Father-Infinite. (106:8.12)
	Destiny is established by the volitional act of the Deities who constitute the Paradise Trinity; destiny is established in the vastness of the three great potentials whose absoluteness encompasses the possibilities of all future development; destiny is probably consummated by the act of the Consummator of Universe Destiny, and this act is probably involved with the Supreme and the Ultimate in the Trinity Absolute. (106:7.3)
	All experiential creations are interdependent in their realization of destiny. (117:6.20)
	As the universes expand, and as gravity and love reach out into time-organizing space, we are able to understand more and more of the First Source and Center. (106:3.5)
	In the union of the Supreme, Ultimate, and the complete Absolute, there could occur the functional reassembly of those aspects of infinity which were originally segmentalized by the I AM, and which resulted in the appearance of the Seven Absolutes of Infinity.  If the second level of the Trinity of Trinities could ever achieve trinity unity it would lead directly to the realization of the I AM as an experiential attainable (106:8.22)
	The present goal of the superuniverses is to become, as they are and within their potentials, perfect, even as is Havona. (117:7.13)
	there is the theoretical possibility of the reuniting of the seven absolute phases of the Father-I AM. (106:7.10)
	The goal of the evolutionary universes is the subjugation of energy-matter by mind, the co-ordination of mind with spirit, and all of this by virtue of the creative and unifying presence of personality. (116:5.15) (116:6.1,4) (117:2.1)

No man, having put his hand to the plough, if he turns back, is worthy to become a messenger of the kingdom. (163:2.3)

Materialism is there, but it is not exclusive; mechanism is there, but it is not unqualified; determinism is there, but it is not alone. The finite universe of matter would eventually become uniform and deterministic but for the combined presence of mind and spirit. (195:6.14-15)

Jesus, taking the roll in the synagogue, stood up and began to read from Deuteronomy: “For this commandment which I give you this day is not hidden from you, neither is it far off”. (150:8.8)
Jesus introduced this sermon by reading from the law as found in Deuteronomy: “But it shall come to pass, if this people will not hearken to the voice of God, that the curses of transgression shall surely overtake them”. (153:2.1)
The scribe of Deuteronomy had portrayed the Great Choice—as between the good and the evil, the blessing and the curse. (97:8.3)

devil; evil one; prince of darkness; devils; prince of devils | | Caligastia; demon possession; Lucifer; Satan | | OK
The “devil” is none other than Caligastia, the deposed Planetary Prince of Urantia and a Son of the secondary order of Lanonandeks.
atonement doctrine teaches that Jesus life in the flesh, together with his death on the cross and subsequent resurrection, was the ransom which had thus been paid in order to purchase man back from the clutch of the evil one —from the condemnation of an offended God. (194:2.8)
The doctrine of a personal devil on Urantia, though it had some foundation in the planetary presence of the traitorous and iniquitous Caligastia, was nevertheless wholly fictitious in its teachings that such a “devil” could influence the normal human mind against its free and natural choosing. (53:1.4) (66:8.6) (179:2.3)
The devil has been given a great deal of credit for evil which does not belong to him. (53:8.9)
The Jewish traditions of heaven and hell and the doctrine of devils as recorded in the Hebrew scriptures, while founded on the lingering traditions of Lucifer and Caligastia, were principally derived from the Zoroastrians during the times when the Jews were under the political and cultural dominance of the Persians. (95:6.6)
nobody should knowingly to ascribe the works of God to the doings of devils (153:4.3)
“Man is the son of God, not a child of the devil.” Mortal man was never the property of the archdeceivers. (145:3.4) (188:4.3) (194:2.1)
Sanhedrin attributed Jesus’ works to power of devil, and that he was a child of the devil (162:7.4-5) (164:4.11) (168:3.4) (169:0.7) (173:2.4)

Of all the problems in the universe requiring an exercise of the consummate wisdom of experience and adaptability, none are more important than those arising out of the relationships and associations of intelligent beings. (28:5.13)
we have to use moral power and spiritual energy to solve difficulties (166:3.8)
when clouds gather overhead, we should look beyond mists of mortal uncertainty (108:6.8)
Then we will become experienced in the skillful wresting of victory from the very jaws of defeat; we will learn how to transform the difficulties of time into the triumphs of eternity. (127:6.12)
do not ask God to solve your difficulties, but never hesitate to ask him for wisdom and spiritual strength to guide and sustain you while you yourself resolutely and courageously attack the problems at hand. (91:6.5)
None of us can do much to change the difficulties of life unless we discover the Father in heaven so wills. (147:3.3)
nobody can talk men out of their perplexities when they reach such a stage of involvement, and when so many persons with strong feelings are concerned. (143:3.1)

friendship lessens sting of difficulties (160:2.9)
intellectual and emotional difficulties do not interfere with certain survival of God-knowing soul (110:3.5)

mortal struggling is not in vain (32:5.1-2)
Many things which happen in the course of a human life are hard to understand, difficult to reconcile with the idea that this is a universe in which truth prevails and in which righteousness triumphs. (194:3.2)
The true perspective of any reality problem —human or divine, terrestrial or cosmic—can be had only by the full and unprejudiced study and correlation of three phases of universe reality: origin, history, and destiny. (19:1.5-12)
wise souls who possess tact and tolerance are able to avoid a good number of difficulties, which nevertheless fall on the emotional misfits, those who refuse to hrow up or those who age badly (156:5.18)
problem avoidance is animal trait which morontia career eradicates (48:5.8)
Personal, spiritual religious experience is an efficient solvent for most mortal difficulties; it is an effective sorter, evaluator, and adjuster of all human problems. (196:3.1)
In the time of testing, a man’s soul is revealed; trial discloses what really is in the heart. (165:6.2)

	Many are the afflictions of the righteous man, but the Lord delivers him out of them all. (131:2.10)
	Master’s love does not deliver us from the difficulties of this world; it does not create a new world, but it most certainly does make the old world new. (180:1.5)
	all believers must traverse a fringe of conflict when passing from the life as it is lived in the flesh to the higher life as it is lived in the spirit. (159:3.7) (160:1.6)
	Kingdom builders, the accredited citizens of the heavenly worlds, are not to be disturbed by temporal upheavals or perturbed by terrestrial cataclysms. (176:3.2)
	when disheartened souls sincerely seek for God —hunger for truth and thirst for righteousness— there is nothing that can hold them in further captivity. (130:1.2)

	many truths only felt in adversity (48:7.18)
	We live on a planet where there has been a great miscarriage of wisdom, but these missteps occur because our universe was not created in perfection. Perfection is our eternal goal, not our origin. (75:8.6-7)

Dilmun | | | PLACE | OK
After the submergence of Dalamatia the Nodites moved north and east, presently founding the new city of Dilmun as their racial and cultural headquarters. Bablot, the builder of the tower of Babel, wanted the monument to be erected in Dilmun, but another site was eventually found. (77:3.1-2)
The Egyptians called this city of ancient glory Dilmat, while the later Adamized Sumerians confused both the first and second Nodite cities with Dalamatia and called all three Dilmun. (77:4.8-9)

dinosaurs | | | | OK
dinosaurs were egg layers and are distinguished from all animals by their small brains, having brains weighing less than one pound to control bodies later weighing as much as 40 tons. (60:1.10)
rapidly evolving reptilian dinosaurs soon became the monarchs of this age. They appear 120 million years ago. The largest of the dinosaurs originated in western North America. Land-animal life reached its greatest development, in point of size, and had virtually perished from the face of the earth by the end of this age. (60:1.10) (60:2.1-6,10)
largest dinosaurs lived in Rocky Mountains (60:2.2)
60 million years ago, though the land reptiles were on the decline, the dinosaurs continued as monarchs of the land, the lead now being taken by the more agile and active types of the smaller leaping kangaroo varieties of the carnivorous dinosaurs. (60:3.20)
none ended buried in Australia (60:2.2)
Extinction
	dinosaurs were short-lived species that soon became extinct and suffer destruction, because of having too little brain substance in comparison with body size. (60:3.20-21) (61:2.5-6)
	These massive creatures became less active and strong as they grew larger and larger; but they required such an enormous amount of food and the land was so overrun by them that they literally starved to death and became extinct—they lacked the intelligence to cope with the situation. (60:2.3,12-14)
Later evolution
	flying pterosaurs were not the ancestors of the true birds of subsequent ages. They evolved from the hollow-boned leaping dinosaurs, and their wings were of batlike. They represent the nonsurviving strains of bird ancestry. (60:1.10) (60:2.12)
	It was from an agile little reptilian dinosaur of carnivorous habits but having a comparatively large brain that the placental mammals suddenly sprang. (61:1.2) (65:2.12)

The four points of the compass are universal and inherent in the life of Nebadon. (34:4.13)
The differences in dimensions of Paradise, taken in connection with its stationary status and the greater out-pressure of force-energy at the north end of the Isle, make it possible to establish absolute direction in the master universe. (11:2.3)
Observation of the so-called Milky Way discloses the comparative increase in Orvonton stellar density when the heavens are viewed in one direction, while on either side the density diminishes; the number of stars and other spheres decreases away from the chief plane of our material superuniverse.

And I exhort him to survival, not to disappoint me, not to deprive me of the reward of my patient and intense struggle” (110:7.10)
disappointments are an inevitability of life if we want to achieve courage, strength of character;a regular and commonplace feature of human existence (3:5.6) (193:4.7)
Only when man has become sufficiently disillusioned by the sorrowful disappointments attendant upon the foolish and deceptive pursuits of selfishness, and subsequent to the discovery of the barrenness of formalized religion, will he be disposed to turn wholeheartedly to the gospel of the kingdom, the religion of Jesus of Nazareth. (195:9.7)
Disappointment and sorrow attend upon error because, not being a reality, it cannot be realized in experience. (2:7.6)
every mortal man knows full well how love, even when once genuine, can, through disappointment, jealousy, and long-continued resentment, be eventually turned into actual hate. (177:4.11)
What a crushing thing is disappointment in the lives of those foolish persons who, in fastening their gaze on the shadowy and evanescent allurements of time, become blinded to the higher achievements (177:4.10)
God-knowing individuals are not discouraged by misfortune or downcast by disappointment. (100:6.6) (100:7.8) (127:6.12) (130:6.4) (156:5.13) (160:4.13)
ascendant children of time learn to feast upon uncertainty, to fatten upon disappointment, to enthuse over apparent defeat, to invigorate in the presence of difficulties, to exhibit indomitable courage in the face of immensity (26:5.3)
friendship lessens sting of disappointments. Difficulties, sorrow, disappointment, and defeat are more painful and disheartening when borne alone. (160:2.9)
greatest disappointment is failure in Deity adventure. But that is not the end. After a period of universal service they will return to the circle of their greatest disappointment and attempt anew the Deity adventure. (26:10.2-4)
Jesus warned his disciples: “each of you must sit down and count the cost of being my disciple. You will be required to face bitter persecutions and to bear witness for this gospel in the face of crushing disappointment”. (171:2.4)
Jesus subjected apostles to repeated rehearsals in disappointment and provided them with frequent and testing opportunities for choosing between the right and the wrong way of meeting spiritual trials (153:1.3) (157:4.1) (158:5.4)
Judas never acquired a philosophic technique for meeting disappointment. (193:4.7)
On Paradise, disappointment is never regarded as defeat; postponement is never looked upon as disgrace; the apparent failures of time are never confused with the significant delays of eternity. (26:8.3)
Jesus once talked for more than an hour to the assembled groups on “The mission of adversity and the spiritual value of disappointment”. (151:0.1)
The disappointments hardest to bear are those which never come. (48:7.21)

the worst disappointment sometimes becomes the greatest blessing (48:6.36)

disarmament | | | | OK

disaster; disasters; catastrophe | | accidents; crisis; defeat | | OK

collisions revivify old burned-out suns (15:5.11)
The endowment of imperfect beings with freedom entails inevitable tragedy, and it is the nature of the perfect ancestral Deity to universally and affectionately share these sufferings in loving companionship. (110:0.1)
if physical catastrophe should doom a planet, all survivors carried away to new world (51:2.3)
Jesus wascheerfully indifferent toward any impending disaster (178:2.1)

The Discerners of Spirits carry on these intricate services by virtue of inherent “spiritual insight” (28:5.20)
A special liaison exists between the counselors and advisers of the second Havona circle and these reflective angels. (28:5.19)
this secoraphic discerners reflect knowledge of Mother Spirit (28:5.22)
The discerners can and do reflect the presence of the Adjusters (and the Censors pronounce them divine), but they cannot decipher the content of the mindedness of the Mystery Monitors. (28:5.22)
They are the only seconaphim attached to the Universal Censors but are probably the most uniquely specialized of all their fellows. (28:5.19-22)

disciples; disciple | | apostleship; faith sons of God | | OK
Jesus requires the life of his disciples, even a life of loving service (191:5.3)

disciples may return home to minister to loved ones, but it is not so with the messengers of the gospel. The latter han forsaken all to follow Jesus and proclaim the kingdom (163:2.2)
If we want be disciples of Jesus, we must be willing to forsake father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters for kingdom (171:2.2-3)
If we are only believing disciples, we must earn our own bread and contribute to the sustenance of all who teach and preach and heal. (165:5.3)
we must be unwilling to renounce all that we are and to dedicate all that we have, or you are unworthy to be his disciple. (150:4.3) (163:3.4) (167:2.2) (171:2.2,4)
Only three men who received Jesus personal call refused to accept the invitation to discipleship. (149:2.12)
disciples versus apostles: (140:6.9-13)
* apostles have everything in common, disciples not
* apostles do an unselfish service, laying up treasures in heaven
* apostles are prepared to drink the cup
* the requirements of apostleship are harder than the less rigorous pathway of discipleship
we are Jesus’ disciples if we do Father’s will, love one another (102:6.7) (162:7.2) (180:1.1) (180:2.1) (191:4.3)

discipline; Discipline | | child-rearing; punishment | | OK
early war imposed discipline and enforced co-operation. (70:2.4)

We are all a part of the family of God, and we must therefore sometimes share in the family discipline. (3:2.9)
And when the Father’s hand of discipline is laid upon the vine, it is done in love, in order that the branches may bear much fruit. And a wise husbandman cuts away only the dead and fruitless branches. (180:2.6) (193:2.2)
few mortals are real thinkers; we do not spiritually develop and discipline our minds to the point of favorable liaison with the divine Adjusters. (110:7.6)
God sometimes chastens us for our own profit (2:5.3)
Tempt not the angels of your supervision to lead you in troublous ways as a loving discipline designed to save your ease-drifting souls. (178:1.10)
Van’s loyalty resulted from disciplined character (67:3.6)
whom the Lord loves he corrects, even as the father corrects the son in whom he takes delight (148:5.5)
in social groups
	Discipline must be maintained, justice must be administered, but in all these matters the wisdom of the brotherhood should prevail. (159:1.3,6)
	social groups of believers have the right to maintain order in their ranks and administer discipline upon unruly and unworthy members. (43:8.4) (178:1.2)
discipline of children
	Among ancient savages, discipline of children was begun very early; and the child early realized that disobedience meant failure or even death just as it did to the animals. (84:7.20-25)
	the children who were adopted in Dalamatia by the members of the Prince's council benefited from the discipline and education of these superparents (66:7.5)
	when applying discipline let compassion be a part of all punishment; in every way endeavor to make punishment a blessing. (131:9.4)
	A father’s love for his son oftentimes impels the father to restrain the unwise acts of his thoughtless offspring. (143:1.4) (177:2.7)
	True, wise fathers may chasten their sons, but they do all this in love and for corrective purposes. (142:7.9) (188:4.10)
Jesus
	in Joseph and Mary’s family, Joseph had the practice to sit down with Jesus and fully explain the real and underlying reasons for the necessity of disciplinary curtailment of personal desires in deference to the welfare and tranquillity of the entire family. (123:3.9)
	Jesus began wise discipline upon his brothers and sisters at such an early age that little or no punishment was ever required to secure their prompt and wholehearted obedience. (127:4.3-4)
	Jesus loved men so much and so wisely that he never hesitated to be severe with them when the occasion demanded such discipline. (171:7.7)
	Then Jesus went on to say: “When your children are very young and immature, and when you must chastise them, they may reflect that their father is angry and filled with resentful wrath. Their immaturity cannot penetrate beyond the punishment to discern the father’s farseeing and corrective affection”. (142:2.4)

disclosure | | secrecy; censorship | | OK
Working for full disclosure and unlimited opportunity for sin-expression is the quickest technique of achieving the perfect and final cure of the plague of evil and sin. (54:5.9-12)

discouragement; discouraged | | disappointment | | OK
Be not discouraged; human evolution is still in progress, and the revelation of God to the world, in and through Jesus, shall not fail. (196:3.33)
Do not become discouraged by the discovery that you are human. (156:5.8)
Confusion, being puzzled, even sometimes discouraged and distracted, does not necessarily signify resistance to the leadings of the indwelling Adjuster. (110:3.5)
 Discouragement, worry, and indolence are positive evidence of moral immaturity. (160:1.6)
Jesus was with Simon Zelotes through all his discouragement (181:2.11)
Jesus' words to Fortune, the young downcast, were: “My friend, arise! Stand up like a man! Your mind should be your courageous ally in the solution of your life problems rather than your being, as you have been, its abject fear-slave and the bond servant of depression and defeat”. (130:6) (130:6)

discoveries; discovery | | | | OK
Commerce, linked with adventure, led to exploration and discovery. (69:4.8)
Jesus’ counsel on wealth derived from discovery was: Everyone who enjoys wealth as a result of discovery should remember that one individual can live on earth but a short season and should, therefore, make adequate provision for the sharing of these discoveries in helpful ways by the largest possible number of his fellow men.
