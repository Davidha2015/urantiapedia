	In earliest times women were the property of the community, and the mother dominated the family. The mother-family was natural and biologic; the father-family is social, economic, and political. (69:9.7) (84:2.2)
	The red men clung to the mother-family and nephew inheritance. (71:1.7)
	Chinese tradition preserves the hazy record of the evolutionary past, the transition from mother- to father-family (79:8.15)
	The oncoming of wife stealing and later wife purchase hastened the passing of the mother-family. (84:2.6)
	Under the mother-family mores the wife’s mother enjoyed virtually supreme authority in the home; even the wife’s brothers and their sons were more active in family supervision than was the husband. (84:2) (84:2.3)
patriarchal families
	The clan peace chiefs usually ruled through the mother line; the tribal war chiefs established the father line. (70:4.10)
	The first real governmental body was the council of the elders.  This reign of the oligarchy of age gradually grew into the patriarchal idea. (70:5.2)
	Pastoral living tended to create a new system of mores, the patriarchal type of family life; and the basis of family unity under the herder and early agricultural mores was the unquestioned and arbitrary authority of the father. (84:2.4) (84:3)
nature of family
	Family life cannot be had without children; it can be lived without religion, but such a handicap enormously multiplies the difficulties of this intimate human association. (99:4.2)
	Whenever the mores fluctuate, there is fluctuation in the stability of the family. Now new mores are emerging: (84:7.1-7)
	# the new role of religion, the teaching that parental experience is essential
	# the new role of science in making procreation more voluntary and controlled
	# the new function of pleasure and the refusal to bear children
	# the improvement of parental instinct, which in each generation only leaves individuals with strong parental instinct
	The Edenic ideal, the whole family as gardeners, was a new idea on Urantia. (84:7.8)
	The advancing ideals of family life are leading to the concept that bringing a child into the world, instead of conferring certain parental rights, entails the supreme responsibility of human existence. (84:7.25)
	a true family—a good family—reveals to the parental procreators the attitude of the Creator to his children (84:7.30)
	The family was the first successful peace group, the man and woman learning how to adjust their antagonisms while at the same time teaching the pursuits of peace to their children. (68:2.8) (84:7.30)
	family members reap benefits and suffer consequences of others’ actions (12:7.11) (54:5.5) (54:6.3-4) (67:7) (145:2.8)
	Sex hunger and mother love establish the family. (70:3.2)
	the family is a temporal institution; that it does not survive death. Jesus did not hesitate to give up his family when the family ran counter to the Father’s will. (140:8.14)
family size
	The size of the family has always been influenced by the standards of living. The higher the standard the smaller the family, up to the point of established status or gradual extinction. (68:6.6)
	reasons ancients desired large families: (84:7.11-19)
	# They were valuable as labourers.
	# They were old-age insurance.
	# Daughters were saleable.
	# Family pride required extension of name.
	# Sons afforded protection and defence.
	# Ghost fear produced a dread of being alone.
	# Certain religions required offspring.
value of families
	almost everything of lasting value has roots in the family (68:2.8) (79:8.9) (140:8.14)
	Real families are built upon tolerance, patience, and forgiveness. (84:7.28) (142:7.11)
	earthly family illustrates the heavenly (142:7.4)
	The most effective of all social groups is the family, more particularly the two parents. The family is the master civilizer. (82:0.2) (160:2.4)
	a true family—a good family—reveals to the parental procreators the attitude of the Creator to his children, while at the same time such true parents portray to their children the first of a long series of ascending disclosures of the love of the Paradise parent (84:7.30)

It is one of the terms that Jesus used as a synonym for the kingdom of heaven. (170:2.24)

famine; famines | | | | OK
Jesus asked his disciples not be perturbed by famines or earthquakes; neither be concerned when they were delivered up to the civil authorities and were persecuted for the sake of the gospel. (176:1.1)
hunger brought prodigal son of the parable to senses (169:1.8)
Man was taught to provide for the hazards of famine, which periodically decimated the world. (66:5.3)

fanaticism | | | | OK
the life purpose must be jealously guarded from the temptation to seek for easy and transient attainment; likewise must it be so fostered as to become immune to the disastrous threats of fanaticism. (160:3.5)
doctrinal fetish will lead mortal man to betray himself into the clutches of bigotry, fanaticism, superstition, intolerance, and the most atrocious of barbarous cruelties. (88:2.7)
overmuch sympathy and pity may degenerate into serious emotional instability; that enthusiasm may drive on into fanaticism (149:4.3)
strong spiritual faith so many times leads directly to disastrous fanaticism, to exaggeration of the religious ego (196:0.6-7)
we must prevent religious fanaticism by scientific mental attitude (99:3.14)
spiritual revelation often so blinds the creature as to precipitate a convulsion of fanaticism or to initiate some other intellectual upheaval which results disastrously. (110:4.5)

farewell salutations | | | | OK
Jesus is not given to farewell ceremonies:
* at the end of his first incarnation he took his leave suddenly and unceremoniously (119:5.3)
* leaving Rome he did not say goodbye to any of his friends (133:0.1)
* when he left Cana after the miracle of the wine he did not say goodbye to anyone (137:5.1)
Melchizedek merely bid his human companions goodnight before disappearing from his sight forever (93:8.1) (93:10.2)

Jesus wanted to have a farm but he did not achieve that dream. Even so, they had at home three cows, four sheep, many chickens, a donkey, pigeons, and a dog. (126:5.10-11)
Jesus’ mother’s brother had a farm on the Megiddo road near Sarid (123:1.7) (123:6.1) (124:1.2,11)
Jude the Jesus brother ran away to his uncle’s farm (128:7.8)

Salem missionaries penetrated all Europe, even to the British Isles. One group went by way of the Faroes to the Andonites of Iceland, (93:7.2)

fashion; dress | | | | OK
fashion is one of human institution of self-gratification, growing out of vanity proclivities and pride emotions (69:1.5)
the races never have been wholly liberated from the slavery of custom; fashion still unduly dominates Urantia. (66:6.2)

fasting | | self-denial | | OK
ancient ritual
	ancients treated disease with fasting (90:4.8)
	fasting can induce mystic state (100:5.10)
	Renunciation came as the next step in religious evolution; fasting was a common practice. (89:3.1)
	Next came the practice of ritual vows, soon to be followed by religious pledges and sacred oaths. Most of these oaths were accompanied by self-torture and self-mutilation; later on, by fasting and prayer. (87:6.16)
	Fasting and other forms of self-denial were thought to be pleasing to the ghosts, who took pleasure in the discomfort of the living (87:2.4)
	Sacrifice as a part of religious devotions, like many other worshipful rituals, did not have a simple and single origin. As civilization advanced, these crude concepts of sacrifice were elevated to the level of the rituals of self-abnegation, asceticism, fasting, deprivation, and the later Christian doctrine of sanctification through sorrow, suffering, and the mortification of the flesh. (89:4.1)
Isaiah
	For Isaiah, acceptable fasting was not afflicting the soul, bowing the head, or dressing in sackloth. What he asked was to loosen the bonds of wickedness, undo the knots of heavy burdens, let the oppressed go free, break every yoke, share bread with the hungry, bring home the homeless poor. (147:8.2-3)
Jesus
	Jesus ate frugally while on Mount Hermon; but he abstained from all food only a day or two at a time. (134:8.3)
	fasting is not part of gospel. Nazarites refused to accept Jesus as a teacher sent from heaven because he did not teach fasting and other forms of self-denial. Jesus said: “In the old order you fasted and prayed; as the new creature of the rebirth of the spirit, you are taught to believe and rejoice”. (142:8.1) (143:2.3) (147:7.2)
	it is most dangerous to knowingly engage in spiritual fasting in order to improve one’s appetite for spiritual endowments. Prolonged fasting, either physical or spiritual, tends to destroy hunger. (140:5.8)

The soul was generally thought of as being identified with the breath, but it was also located by various peoples in the head, hair, heart, liver, blood, and fat. (86:5.15)

fatalism; fatalists; fatalistic | | | | OK
The better Epicureans were not given to sensual excesses. At least this doctrine helped to deliver the Romans from a more deadly form of fatalism; it taught that men could do something to improve their terrestrial status. (121:4.2)
Unbelieving materialists and fatalists can hope to enjoy only two kinds of peace and soul comfort: Either they must be stoics, with steadfast resolution determined to face the inevitable and to endure the worst; or they must be optimists, ever indulging that hope which springs eternal in the human breast, vainly longing for a peace which never really comes. (181:1.7)
primitive religion prevented fatalism; they believed they could at least do something to influence fate. (86:7.3)
Jesus’ teaching to trust in the overcare of the heavenly Father was not a blind and passive fatalism. (140:8.2)

Fate | | | | OK
the concept of Fate prevented evolution of Zeus in Greece to true monotheism (98:1.3)

The monotheists keep their subordinate gods as spirits, demons, fates, Nereids, fairies, brownies, dwarfs, banshees, and the evil eye. (96:1.14)

Father Melchizedek is the one who assumes the position of Gabriel in his absence (33:6.2) (35:1.2)
he never absents from Salvington if Gabriel is not there (35:1.2)
he is always free to travel to other local universes in the interest of his order (35:1.4)
he created the local universe Melchizedek Sons in a creative act in union with the Creator Son and the Mother Spirit (20:1.10) (35:1.1)
he created the Spirongas in a creative act together with Gabriel (37:10.2)

fatherhood of God; Fatherhood of God; Fatherhood | | gospel:explained | | OK
The brotherhood of men is founded on the fatherhood of God. (16:9.14) (52:6.7) (134:4.1) (159:5.7) (195:8.11)
When all is said and done, the Father idea is still the highest human concept of God. (196:3.35)
The Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man present the paradox of the part and the whole on the level of personality. (12:7.8)
Fatherhood becomes, or may become, a universe reality to all moral creatures because the Father has himself bestowed personality upon all such beings and has encircuited them within the grasp of the universal personality circuit. (16:9.14)

Fatherlikeness | | divinity; spiritual growth | | OK
We will sometime realize that success in the quest of the Infinite is directly proportional to the achievement of Fatherlikeness, and that in this universe age the realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity. (106:9.11)

fathers | | child-rearing; children; family | | OK
Jesus stated that a true family is founded on the following seven facts: (142:7.5-12)
# The fact of existence. The children take origin in the parents
# Security and pleasure. True fathers take great pleasure in providing for the needs of their children.
# Education and training. Wise fathers carefully plan for the education
# Discipline and restraint. Farseeing fathers also make provision for the necessary discipline
# Companionship and loyalty. The affectionate father holds intimate and loving intercourse with his children.
# Love and mercy. A compassionate father is freely forgiving
# Provision for the future. Temporal fathers like to leave an inheritance for their sons.
we must call no man father in spiritual sense (175:1.10)
Children need fathers as well as mothers, and fathers need this parental experience as much as do mothers. (47:1.6)
The child must derive his first impressions of the universe from the mother’s care; he is wholly dependent on the earthly father for his first ideas of the heavenly Father. (177:2.5,7)
disciples must love gospel more than his father or mother (150:4.3) (171:2.2)
The earliest races gave little credit to the father, looking upon the child as coming altogether from the mother. (84:2.4)
become the head of a human family is a highly educational and disciplinary responsibility (126:2.2)
It is intended that mortals who start out from an inhabited world have the experience of recognizing seven fathers: (51:6.6-13)
# The biologic father — the father in the flesh.
# The father of the realm — the Planetary Adam.
# The father of the spheres — the System Sovereign.
# The Most High Father — the Constellation Father.
# The universe Father — the Creator Son
# The super-Fathers — the Ancients of Days
# The spirit or Havona Father — the Universal Father
Fathers are not like judges, enemies, or creditors. Real families are built upon tolerance, patience, and forgiveness. (142:7.11)

Jerusalem temple was called by Jesus “his Father’s house.” (125:1.1) (125:6.7) (171:4.7)
Paradise is sometimes called “the Father’s House” since it is his eternal residence, and these seven zones are often designated “the Father’s Paradise mansions. (11:3.3)
Jesus said that each of the many, many stations in his Father’s house, that is, the universe, is a stopping place, a life designed to prepare us for the next one ahead. (181:1.2)

Father’s prayer | | | | OK
Hap, the Planetary Prince assistant, taught Dalamatians the seven chants of worship and also gave them the daily praise-phrase and eventually taught them “the Father’s prayer,” which was: (66:5.14-15)
“Father of all, whose Son we honor, look down upon us with favor. Deliver us from the fear of all save you. Make us a pleasure to our divine teachers and forever put truth on our lips. Deliver us from violence and anger; give us respect for our elders and that which belongs to our neighbors. Give us this season green pastures and fruitful flocks to gladden our hearts. We pray for the hastening of the coming of the promised uplifter, and we would do your will on this world as others do on worlds beyond”

Father’s Way; Father’s way | | | | OK
The Father’s way is the exemplification of a farseeing ideal of creature life visualized by the high personalities of the Paradise administration of the universe of universes. (136:4.8)
Hap presented the early races with a moral law in Dalamatia. This code was known as “The Father’s Way” and consisted of the following seven commands: (66:7.8-16)
# No temerás ni servirás a ningún Dios, salvo al Padre de todos.
# No desobedecerás al Hijo del Padre, el soberano del mundo, ni mostrarás falta de respeto por sus asociados superhumanos.
# No mentirás cuando seas convocado ante los jueces del pueblo.
# No matarás a hombres, mujeres o niños.
# No robarás los bienes ni el ganado de tu prójimo.

favoritism; respecter of persons | | | | OK
Do not expect favoritism. In all our praying be fair; do not expect God to show partiality, to love you more than his other children, our friends, neighbors, even enemies. (91:4.3)
God is no respecter of persons, either spiritual or material. (1:4.6) (2:3.1) (12:7.1,8) (40:10.13) (133:0.3) (137:8.6) (138:8.2) (140:3.16) (143:1.5) (148:6.2) (155:6.2) (156:2.4) (166:4.11) (175:2.1-3) (181:2.14) (192:2.2)
Every son of God shares the fatherhood of God, and God loves each of his creature sons alike; he is no more a respecter of ascendant destinies than is he of the creatures who may attain such destinies. (40:10.5,13)
Joseph and Mary were sometimes tempted to show some kind of special favoritism for Jesus. But his parents were wise and sagacious. The few times they exhibit any preference for him in any way, even in the slightest degree, Jesus was quick to refuse all such special consideration. (124:3.2)

	the Caligastia's one hundred sought to substitute Creator fear for creature fear, or ghost worship (66:5.13)

	Fear has always been the basic religious stimulus. (86:0.2) (90:3.10) (92:1.4)
	“The ‘fear of the Lord’ has had different meanings in the successive ages, coming up from fear, through anguish and dread, to awe and reverence. Evolution of fear goes through awe, dread, dependence, and reverence, to the appreciative and affectionate regard of love. (149:6.3,6)
	Sooner or later the fear instinct fosters the establishment of these institutions of survival by means of taboo, convention, and religious sanction. (69:1.3)
	Two other emotions which drove human beings together and held them together were vanity and fear, more particularly ghost fear. (68:2.4) | ghosts

fellowship of believers | | Christianity; churches; faith sons of God; groups | | OK
The fellowship of believers is the true institution that Jesus came to establish on Urantia, also called the brotherhood of the kingdom of heaven or the spiritual fellowship in eternal realities. Jesus delivered his apostles and his successors the keys of the outward kingdom, that is, the authority over things temporal, the social and economic features of this association of men and women. But not about the whole association. (157:4.5)
Jesus declared that he who is not against us is with us. He warned against establishing unlimited administrative and jurisdictional control between groups of believers, which is just what happened with Christianity. (159:2.2)
The true church—the Jesus brotherhood—is invisible, spiritual, and is characterized by unity, not necessarily by uniformity. (195:10.11)
Jesus pledged full support for social and nonespiritual decissions of his apostles provided all agreed (144:6.3)
Jesus used the term fellowship of believers as synonim for kingdom of heaven (170:2.24)
this brotherhood of believers is destined to become a living organism in contrast to an institutionalized social organization. It may well utilize such social organizations, but it must not be supplanted by them. (195:10.11)
The kingdoms of this world, being material, may often find it necessary to employ physical force in the execution of their laws and for the maintenance of order, but this does not nullify the right of social groups of believers to maintain order in their ranks and administer discipline upon unruly and unworthy members. (159:1.3) (178:1.2)
no intellectual, social, and moral distinction should be made in the spiritual brotherhood of men when they come together to worship in the presence of God (133:0.3)
there should be no place for sectarian rivalry, assertions of moral superiority, or spiritual infallibility (182:1.8) (195:10.14)
Living associations, human families, social groups, or the Paradise Trinity are not augmented by mere arithmetical summation, is far in excess of the simple sum. (10:5.2) (68:1.4) (133:5.1)

One of the most ancient forms of the wedding ceremony was to have a priest bless the wedding bed to insure the fertility of the union. It was the custom of many Near Eastern peoples to throw grain upon the newlyweds; this was a magical rite which was supposed to insure fecundity. Certain Oriental peoples used rice for this purpose. Childlessness was greatly dreaded, and since barrenness was attributed to spirit machinations, efforts to insure fecundity also led to the association of marriage with certain magical or religious ceremonials.
