#### I. THE FIRST SOURCE AND CENTER

> 1\. God, as the First Source and Center, is primal in relation to total reality—unqualifiedly; infinite as well as eternal and therefore limited or conditioned only by volition. [(5.8) 0:3.9](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/foreword#U0_3_9)
> 
> 2\. The God of the First Source and Center exercises cosmic overcontrol by absolute Paradise gravity. [(24.8) 1:2.10](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-1-universal-father#U1_2_10)
> 
> 3\. The Universal Father is the personality of the First Source and Center. [(5.9) 0:3.10](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/foreword#U0_3_10)
> 
> 4\. The First Source and Center is that infinity who unqualifiedly transcends all mind. all matter, and all spirit. [(31.7) 1:7.7](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-1-universal-father#U1_7_7)
>

#### II. THE I AM

> 1\. The concept of the I AM is a philosophic concession which is made to the time-bound, space-fettered, finite mind of man, to the impossibility of creature comprehension of eternity existences, nonbeginning, nonending realities and relationships.[(6.3) 0:3.23](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/foreword#U0_3_23)
> 
> 2\. The I AM achieves personality by becoming the Eternal Father of the Original Son and the Eternal Source of Paradise.[(6.2) 0:3.22](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/foreword#U0_3_22)
> 
> 3\. Absolute causation resides in the Universal Father functioning as the I AM. [(1152.4) 105:1.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-105-deity-and-reality#U105_1_1)

> 5. The Infinite Potential.

#### 3\. THE NATURE OF GOD

> 1\. God is not a synonym for nature, neither is he natural law personified. God is a transcendent reality, not mans traditional concept of supreme values. God is not a psychological focalization of spiritual meanings, neither is he “the noblest work of man.” God may be any or all of these concepts, but he is more. He is a saving and loving Father. [(23.5) 1:2.2](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-1-universal-father#U1_2_2)

> > 
> > 2\. The unstinted bestowal of himself upon his universes does not diminish his potential of power, wisdom, and love. [(49.5) 3:4.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-3-attributes-god#U3_4_1)
> > 
> > 3\. The infinity of God should be the supreme assurance that throughout all endless futurity an ascending personality will have before him the possibility of Deity association which even eternity will neither exhaust nor transcend.

> > 
> > 2\. Mercy is not a contravention of justice, but rather an understanding interpretation of the demands of supreme justice as it is fairly applied to material creatures. [(38.5) 2:4.5](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-2-nature-god#U2_4_5)
