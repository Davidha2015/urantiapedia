#### I. CONCEPTS OF THE KINGDOM

> 1\. The Jewish religion embraced many and confusing concepts of the kingdom of Heaven. [(1858.3) 170:1.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-170-kingdom-heaven#U170_1_1)
> 
> 2\. Though Jesus presented varying aspects of the kingdom, his last word always was: “The kingdom is within you.” [(1859.5) 170:1.13](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-170-kingdom-heaven#U170_1_13)
> 
> 3\. Jesus presented five cardinal features of the gospel of the kingdom.
> 
> 1. Pre-eminence of the individual.
> 2. Will as determining factor.
> 3. Sonship with God the Father.
> 4. The loving service of men.
> 5. Transcendency of the spiritual over the material. [(1863.6) 170:4.8](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-170-kingdom-heaven#U170_4_8)
> 
> 4\. The gospel of the kingdom is the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man. [(2052.4) 193:0.4](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-193-final-appearances-and-ascension#U193_0_4)

#### II. THE BROTHERHOOD OF MAN

> 1\. Brotherhood means that the part profits or suffers in measure with the whole. [(138.6) 12:7.11](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-12-universe-universes#U12_7_11)
> 
> 2\. Always must God first find man that man may later find God. [(1299.3) 118:5.3](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-118-supreme-and-ultimate-time-and-space#U118_5_3)
>

> 
> 4\. The Jews exalted goodness, the Greeks beauty, the Hindus devotion. The ascetics taught reverence, the Romans demanded loyalty. But Jesus required life—loving service for our brothers in the flesh. [(2043.1) 191:5.3](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-191-appearances-apostles-and-other-leaders#U191_5_3)
