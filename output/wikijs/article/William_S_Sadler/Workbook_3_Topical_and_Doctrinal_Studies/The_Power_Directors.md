#### I. THE SUPREME POWER DIRECTORS

> 1\. The Supreme Power Directors create seven groups of associates—they are the physical energy directors of the grand universe. [(320.1) 29:1.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-29-universe-power-directors#U29_1_1)
> 
> 2\. These seven groups are:
> 
> 1. Supreme Center Supervisors.
> 2. Havona Centers.
> 3. Superuniverse Centers.
> 4. Local Universe Centers.

> 
> 3\. The Supreme Power Directors operate from the periphery of Paradise. [(320.5) 29:2.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-29-universe-power-directors#U29_2_1)
> 
> 4\. Power Directors are energy catalyzers—they cause energy to organize and assemble in unit formation by their presence. [(471.6) 42:2.22](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-42-energy-mind-and-matter#U42_2_22)
> 
> 5\. In the evolutionary cosmos energy-matter is dominant except in personality, where spirit, through the mediation of mind, is striving for the mastery. [(140.10) 12:8.14](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-12-universe-universes#U12_8_14)

#### III. MASTER FORCE ORGANIZERS

> 1\. Three groups of beings have to do with force control and energy regulation:
> 
> 1. Primary Eventuated Master Force Organizers.
> 2. Associate Transcendental Master Force Organizers.
> 3. Universe Power Directors. (329.1) 29:5.1
> 
> 2\. Paradise Force Organizers function throughout the master universe under the supervision of the Master Architects. [(329.1) 29:5.1](https://www.urantia.org/urantia-book-standardized/paper-29-universe-power-directors#U29_5_1)
>
