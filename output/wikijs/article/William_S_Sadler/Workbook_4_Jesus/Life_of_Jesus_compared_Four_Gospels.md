THE APOCRYPHA

I. THE OLD TESTAMENT APOCRYPHA

A. **THE OLD TESTAMENT CANON**

1. It took one thousand years to assemble the 39 books which make up the Old Testament.
2. The Old Testament Canon was established at a meeting of rabbis at Jamnia in A.D. 90.
3. All writings of later date than Ezra and Nehemiah were rejected.
4. Christian usage of Old Testament scriptures constrained the Jews to close the Old Testament Canon.
5. The rejected writings were divided into two classes:
    1. The Apocrypha.
    2. The Apocalypse.

B. **OLD TESTAMENT APOCRYPHA** (Hidden or spurious)

1. I ESDRAS

> Decline and fall of Judah from the time of Josiah. Overthrow of Jerusalem and the Babylonian exile. The return under Ezra—reorganization of the Jewish state. Persian kings rebuild the temple. Ezra’s war on mixed marriages.

2. II ESDRAS

> The Lord’s anger against Israel—the end of the age. Ezra’s seven visions of judgment and retribution, including the vision of women. Prophecies of war and calamity. Rule of the Messiah for 400 years.

3. TOBIT

> The blind Tobit, a captive in Nineveh, sends his son Tobias to collect a debt in Media. Tobias marries the seven times widowed virgin, and by fish gall dispatches the demon who had killed her husbands. Collects the debt, returns, and the father’s sight is restored. Tobias left Nineveh before it was destroyed.

4. JUDITH

> Holophernes, an Assyrian general, acting for Nebuchadnezzar, besieged Bethulia. Judith, a pious Jewish widow, enters his camp, and while he is in a drunken stupor, beheads him, taking his head back to the Jewish camp. The Assyrian army is dispersed.

5. ADDITIONS TO ESTHER

> Has to do with Esther at the court of Artaxerxes and Mardocheus’ dream. Discussion of Mordecai’s dream. The king’s edict in favor of the Jews.

6. THE WISDOM OF SOLOMON

> Contrasts the righteous and the ungodly. The rewards of pleasure and salvation. The attainments of wisdom—the gift of God. Heroes of wisdom from Adam to Moses—contrasted with the wicked. Israelites contrasted with Egyptians.

7. ECCLESIASTICUS

> (Wisdom of Jesus the Son of SIRACH)

> One of the best of the Old Testament Apocrypha—compares with Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. Resignation and humility. How to get wisdom. Kindness and self-control. The wise and the foolish. Sins of the rich. Training children. Dreams and travel. Higher education. Despite misery, poverty is best. Fathers worry about daughters. Olden fathers from Adam to Nehemiah. Denunciation of the gentiles. Giving thanks to the Lord. Good and bad wives. Table manners. Mourning. Doxology.

8. BARUCH—secretary to Jeremiah

> Repentance of Jews after destruction of Jerusalem. Praise of wisdom. Promise of return from Babylonian exile.

9. THE EPISTLE OF JEREMY

> A sarcastic denunciation of the folly of idolatry.

10. SONG OF THE THREE HOLY CHILDREN

> (The Prayer of Azariah)

> Inserted in the Third Chapter of Daniel. The song of the three youths in the fiery furnace.

11. SUSANNA

> Susanna, wife of wealthy Jewish exile, repulses advances of two Jewish elders. They accuse her of adultery and she is condemned to death. Daniel convicted the elders of false testimony—she was vindicated and they were executed.

12. BEL AND THE DRAGON

> Daniel traps the priests of Bel by ashes on temple floor—showing they ate the food, not Bel. Daniel poisons the Dragon and is cast into the lion’s den. Habakkuk was flown from Judea by angels to bring him his dinner. Eventually Daniel was delivered.

13. THE PRAYER OF MANASSEH

> A penitential psalm composed to go along with 2 Chron. 33:11-13.

14. FIRST AND SECOND BOOKS OF MACCABEES

> First and Second Maccabees present reliable history. The Maccabees are in reality the Hasmonaean family. They won independence for the Jews from 166 to 63 B.C.

> 1. Judas Maccabeus was one of five sons of the priest Mattathais.
> 2. He rebelled against Antiochus Epiphanes (IV), King of Syria.
> 3. Antiochus defiled the temple at Jerusalem. (See Dan. 11:31)
> 4. After killing a would-be Syrian priest, Mattathias and his five sons fled to the hills.
> 5. Judas, by guerrilla warfare, defeated the Syrians, entered Jerusalem and re-established the temple service. (The Feast of Dedication—see John 10:22)
> 6. Fighting on for political independence, Judas died in battle. His younger brother took over, but was later killed by a Syrian general.
> 7. Then Simon, the last son, took charge. He made a treaty of peace with Syria.
> 8. In 134 B.C. Simon and two sons were murdered by his son-inlaw.
> 9. The third son, John Hyrcanus, took over. He brought the Jews to the height of their power.
> 10. John was succeeded by his son, Aristobulus, who murdered his mother and a brother, and imprisoned three other brothers.
> 11. Alexandra—the widow—married one of the brothers. Wars went on, and the struggle between the Pharisees and the Sadducees began.
> 12. Next, Alexandra takes the throne, and was succeeded by her son, Aristobulus II.
> 13. Internal troubles brought Rome into the picture. In 63 B.C. the dynasty ended. Rome took over.
> 14. Herod the Great marries Marianne, granddaughter of Hyrcanus II. She was a beautiful woman. Herod murdered her and her sons.
> 15. First Maccabees covers 40 years, from the beginning of Antiochus to the death of Simon.

> > Second Maccabees covers the remainder of the dynasty. Herod ruled under Rome.
> > 
> > (Third and Fourth Maccabees are not reliable.)

3. **GOSPEL OF BARTHOLOMEW**

> Jesus tells Bartholomew that 30,000 souls leave this world each day. Tells him about going down to Hades. Later, Jesus tells him that only 50 of these souls are righteous. But some of these others may later be saved. Jesus another time told him 12,880 persons die each day. Begs Jesus to show him the Devil. Jesus finally does—a dragon-like monster. The Devil tells him how to deceive men. (Gluttony, adultery, blasphemy, idolatry, suicide, etc.)

> Bartholomew looks into the bottomless pit. Learns about different kinds of punishment for sins. Satan said he had 600 Demon assistants. Discussion about the sin against the Holy Ghost.

5. **ASSUMPTION OF THE VIRGIN**

> Evodius; associate of Andrew and Peter and seventy-second disciple, says he saw all of this: Jesus returned with a chariot of cherubim and Mary’s soul leaped to his bosom. Then Mary dies and her body is hidden. It is not corrupted. Jesus returns and takes the body to Paradise. David comes with Jesus. Mary lived in Jerusalem with a group of virgins. There were 206 days from her death to the assumption. The voice of the Trinity welcomed Mary to Paradise. Jesus brought back Mary’s soul to embrace the resurrected body.

> High priest’s hand cut off. He confesses guilt of the crucifixion, embraces Mary’s body, and his hand grows back on his arm.

> Mary went daily to pray at Jesus’ sepulchre, but no one could see her. Gabriel would visit with her. Many apostles resurrected to salute Mary at the assumption—Peter was their spokesman. Thomas came from India. Every sick person who touched the wall of Mary’s sepulchre was healed. Mary and the apostles are transported by air to Jerusalem-from Bethlehem to escape the priests who wanted to burn Mary’s body when she died. As the apostles carry Mary on her bed, a Jew sits on the bed. His arms are cut off by an angelic sword and dangle in the air over the bed.

> When Mary was in danger at Bethlehem John was preaching at Ephesus and was transported by air to Mary’s assistance. Mary’s dead body shone with a dazzling brightness. A bright cloud hovered over the funeral procession. Angels were singing in the cloud.

F. **THE EPISTLES**

2. **LETTER OF LENTULUS**

> Contains a detailed description of Jesus’ portrait.

3. **EPISTLE TO THE LAODICEANS**

> Purported to be written by Paul. It is a very mediocre production compared to Paul’s other writings.

4. **CORRESPONDENCE OF PAUL AND SENECA**

> Seneca, at Caesar’s court, exchanges some 14 letters with Paul. Nothing noteworthy is found in these communications.

5. **EPISTLE TO THE APOSTLES**

> This is the major work of the Epistles. It is a lengthy but commonplace review of many events in Jesus’ life. There is an answer to a question as to when he would be coming back after he returned to his Father. The answer appears to say that he would return after 150 years.

G. **APOCALYPSES**

1. **APOCALYPSE OF PETER**

> Begins with a discussion of illegitimate children—how they are put in the hands of “caretaker angels.”

> Peter asks Jesus to show him someone who had departed this world. He was shown a man whose face shone like the sun. His body was whiter than snow—altogether, he looked like a rainbow.

> Then Peter was shown Hell. Men hanging by their tongues. Women hanging by their hair. Others hanging by their feet—all being tortured by fire. Moneylenders for usury were in a lake of molten fire. There was a special pit of fire for homosexuals.

> In the resurrection, beasts and fowls were required to restore all that they had eaten—that the very identical particles should become part of the resurrected bodies of the saints. The bones, flesh, skin must be the same as before death.

> When Jesus returns on a cloud of angels the sea becomes fire. Some wicked are devoured by worms. Special punishment is given women

2. **THE APOCALYPSE OF PAUL**

> This purports to be what Paul saw when he was transported to the third heaven—see Cor. 12:2. It is apparent that Dante got much of the material for his Inferno from this document.

> This story ranges far and wide.

> This book was found when digging for a house foundation in Tarsus. Was taken to the Emperor at Rome who opened the box.

> There is an interesting account of the work of the recording angels. There seems to be two kinds of angels—good and bad. This revelation teaches the resurrection of the identical body of death—contrary to teaching in the New Testament letters.

> He sees in Paradise the names of the saints in golden letters on the walls of the city. He saw rivers of milk and honey and the tree of life with 12 fruits. Date trees with clusters of 10,000. Grapes with 10,000 on a bunch. Paul learns that the root of all evil is pride.

> He is taken to a special city—the city of Christ, where he sees rivers of milk, honey, oil, wine, etc. There was a river of fire and another neither hot nor cold for lukewarm and indifferent mortals. There was a deep pit for some offenders—it required five hundred years to reach the bottom.

> The hardhearted were put naked in a region of ice and snow, with worms to gnaw their flesh. Paul visits with Moses, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—also Job, Enoch, and John the Baptist.

3. **THE APOCALYPSE OF THOMAS**

> Much about the last judgments on earth—rain of blood, etc. Depicts the end of the world, but contains little not found in other writing attributed to Thomas.

4. **THE REVELATION OF STEPHEN**

> The story of Saul seeing Stephen stoned to death. Gamaliel rebukes Saul.

2. **EPISTLE OF BARNABAS**

> This is one of the best of all the Apocrypha—almost worthy of a place in the New Testament Canon. One of the few apocryphal books without miracles.

> Denounces sacrifices and burnt offerings. Quotes much from the Old Testament, Daniel, Isaiah, and others. Refers to many prophecies concerning Christ. Discusses the spiritual aspects of circumcision, etc. Treats the spiritual meaning of clean and unclean beasts, and claims that baptism and the cross were foretold in prophecy. Claims that God’s promises refer to the gentiles as well as to the Jews.

> Discusses the spiritual aspects of Sabbath keeping, and portrays the real meaning of the temple and its services.

> Teaches the “way of life”—the things a Christian must be and do in order to be happy.

> In Chapter 14, Verse 11, he seems to offer objections to birth control, as well as to abortion and infanticide. And then he portrays the “way of darkness”—the path to destruction.
