III. AUTHORSHIP

1. Next to nothing is known of the author-not even his name; only that he lived and preached in Babylon during the exile.

2. He is the most impersonal of all the prophets, yet he is at the top of them-comparable to Paul.

3. He is equal to any disaster, and proclaims his message with a sovereign independence.

4. He knows all the traditions of Israel and the Babylonian astrology and magic.

5. Comparison of a Cyrus cylinder with Isa, 45:1 suggests that the author may have belonged to Cyrus's official family.

6. His anger might be great, but always his compassion triumphed.

7. He originated a "theology of world history."

8. He was the most evangelical of all the prophets.

9. He was the founder of the synagogue.

10. He was Israel's greatest poet, profoundest philosopher, and transcendent prophet.

11. He scales the heights of ecstatic praise and descends to the depths of darkest grief.

IV. LITERARY STYLE

1. There is little in common when we compare the literary style of the First and Second Isaiahs.

2. Chapters 56-66, again, are in a different style than Chapters 40-55.

3. Careful study reveals a "wholeness" and continuity of plan in Deutero-Isaiah. The poetic form, structure, and style suggest that this book was **written**\-rather than being a record of preaching.

4. It is probable that he preached his own poetry-just the reverse practice of the former prophets.

5. His oriental style may at times tend toward rhetorical excess.

6. Isaiah is much improved by being read aloud.

7. Deutero-Isaiah is the most dramatic in style of all the Old Testament writings, not excepting Job.

8. Much of this Isaiah could be the better understood by reading Jeremiah and Ezekiel.

9. The high points of his work are the four "suffering servant" songs: 42:1-4. 49:1-6. 50:1-9. 52:13-53:12.

10. He is fond of quotations and uses them very effectively.

11. His writings are characterized by:

A. Poetic parallelisms.

B. Varied grammatical construction.

C. Repetitions-a dozen types.

D. Clever rhetorical devices.

E. Alliterations.

F. Even rhymes.

G. Dramatic style.

12. His work shows Isaiah to be a master of oriental literary devices, viz.:

Strong contrasts.

Figurative forms.

Question devices.

Dialogue.

Quotations.

Satire (44:9-20).

Historic analogue.

Use of imperatives.

Repetition (Comfort, comfort, 40:1).

13. Me was a master of oriental imagery. He portrayed God as:

Shepherd.

Conqueror.

Warrior.

Woman in travail.

Destroyer.

Leader of the blind.

King on his throne.

Universal judge.

Faithful husband.

Father of Israel.

Creator.

Redeemer.

Lord of nature and history.

14. There is a characteristic use of triads. See 47:4. "Our Redeemer-the Lord of Hosts is his name-is the Holy One of Israel."

V. TEACHINGS OF ISAIAH

1. Isaiah is always referring to history-Yahweh's dealings with his people.

2. The theme song: Joy in the presence of sorrow, defeat, and disaster.

3. Israel's Creator is to become a Redeemer.

4. The work is a drama of creation, history, arid redemption.

5. Yahweh is the eternal-everlasting God.

6. Yahweh alone is God.

7. God reveals himself in his word.

8. Isaiah proclaimed Cyrus as God's agent of deliverance.

9. Yahweh is the Holy One of Israel.

10. Israel would be led by Yahweh.

11. Israel is chosen to become the "light of the nations."

12. Yahweh rules in the kingdom of men.

13. The teaching is dominated by promises, assurance, and exhortation.

14. There is an absence of invective and threats in contrast to the other prophets.

15. He is typically Hebrew. His poems are:

A. Episodic-rather than rational.

B. Dramatic-rather than expository.

C. Lyrical-rather than prosaic.

16. A typical verse:

"Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done it;

shout, O depths of the earth;

break forth into singing, O mountains,

O forest, and every tree in it!

For the Lord has redeemed Jacob,

and will be glorified in Israel." 44:23.

17. He was fond of portraying spiritual redemption in the imagery of military victory.

18. He reiterates: Remember history and expect the new age.

19. His battle cry: "Fear not."

20. "Behold" is the theme word.

21. An earmark is: "Thus says the Lord."

22. Creation is the beginning-salvation the end.

23. The end of national gods. "I am God and there is none other."

24. Monotheism becomes of philosophic age-theologic maturity.

VI. WORLD INFLUENCE OF THE ISAIAHS

1. In the New Testament Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all made use of Isaiah as referring to Christ's work. There are more than 25 quotations in the New Testament.

2. Jesus many times made use of Isaiah in reference to his work.

3. The "suffering servant" is the great problem of Isaiah. Does it refer to:

A. Some prophet?

B. Israel?

C. Messiah-Christ?

4. Three world religions come from Deutero-Isaiah:

A. Judaism.

B. Christianity.

C. Islam.

VII. DEUTERO-ISAIAH IN THE URANTIA BOOK

1. The following passages appear in Third Isaiah, but according to the Urantia Book [UB 97:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p7_11)) were written by Second Isaiah: [57:15](/en/Bible/Isaiah/57#v15). [66:1](/en/Bible/Isaiah/66#v1). [58:11](/en/Bible/Isaiah/58#v11).

2. Quotations in the Urantia Book, p. [UB 97:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p7_5): [40:15](/en/Bible/Isaiah/40#v15). [55:9](/en/Bible/Isaiah/55#v9). [45:18](/en/Bible/Isaiah/45#v18). [44:6](/en/Bible/Isaiah/44#v6). [51:6](/en/Bible/Isaiah/51#v6). [41:10](/en/Bible/Isaiah/41#v10). [45:21](/en/Bible/Isaiah/45#v21). [43:1](/en/Bible/Isaiah/43#v1). [43:2](/en/Bible/Isaiah/43#v2).

[44:6](/en/Bible/Isaiah/44#v6). [50:2](/en/Bible/Isaiah/50#v2). [42:16](/en/Bible/Isaiah/42#v16). [43:7](/en/Bible/Isaiah/43#v7). [43:25](/en/Bible/Isaiah/43#v25). [66:1](/en/Bible/Isaiah/66#v1). [57:15](/en/Bible/Isaiah/57#v15). [58:11](/en/Bible/Isaiah/58#v11). [59:19](/en/Bible/Isaiah/59#v19).

VIII. THE THIRD ISAIAH

1. There was no such person as the Third Isaiah. These writings were produced by ardent members of the "Isaiah cult."

2. Chapters 56-66 were produced after the exile.

3. This third group of writings was added to Isaiah by his followers, and also because they were written in verse-poetic.

4. Jesus uses passages from Third Isaiah about his gospel message. Luke 4:18-21. (Isa. 61:1,2)

5. Many sayings of the first Isaiah are found in Third Isaiah. (Some examples are found on [UB 97:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/97#p5_2) of the Urantia Book.)

6. There were several authors of Third Isaiah, as shown by inconsistencies and contradictions.

7. Third Isaiah talks about the "new age"-new heavens and the new earth.

8. Third Isaiah sounds much like the writings of Haggai and Zechariah.

9. Remember: These are the times of Ezra and Nehemiah.

10. When the passages of First and Second Isaiah are removed from Third Isaiah there is not much left of high spiritual or prophetic value.

11. There is no mention of the "servant of the Lord" in Third Isaiah.

12. Third Isaiah is more devoted to the "cult," Sabbath-keeping, fasting, temples, worship, and sacrifices.

SUMMING IT ALL UP

If you had to put all of all three Isaiahs in one verse, it might be Isa. 41:13:

"For I, the Lord your God,

hold your right hand;

it is I who say to you, 'Fear not,

I will help you.'"
