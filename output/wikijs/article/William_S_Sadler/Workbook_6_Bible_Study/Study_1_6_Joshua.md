III. AUTHORSHIP

1. When it comes to the determination of authorship, Joshua is the most difficult and complex of all the books of the Old Testament.

2. J, E, D, and P can all be traced through the book, but D is predominant.

3. The P contributions appear most in the last half of the book.

4. Joshua, a tribal hero of Ephraim, was magnified into the leader of all Israel and author of this book.

5. Joshua is a [Deuteronomic book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deuteronomist). This same Deuteronomic style runs through Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings.

6. It would seem to be the work of one individual, not the production of a group.

IV. HISTORICAL ASPECTS

1. Joshua takes up the history of Israel on the east bank of the Jordan where Numbers left them.

2. Archaeology has lent much evidence to prove the correctness of Joshua. These excavations are at Jericho, Bethel, Lachish, and Debir.

3. According to Joshua, the Israelites cross the Jordan, take Jericho, and then cut a swath right through the middle of Palestine. Then they subdue the south and then the north.

4. But, in other places, the record confirms the fact that this conquest was not complete. Jerusalem was not conquered until the times of David. (See [Judges 1](/en/Bible/Judges/1.htm).)

5. Excavations show that many Canaanite cities suffered two or even three total destructions.

V. THE RELIGIOUS MESSAGE

1. From a religious standpoint, Joshua represents the story of God's dealings with his people.

2. The authors use the medium of history to hammer home their points.

3. When we face the religious aspects of Joshua our problem is: How can you reconcile Yahweh's holy wars-injunction to destroy all men, women, and children-with the ethical teachings of the Old Testament and the teachings of Jesus Christ?

4. Yahweh claims dedicated obedience, because of the following:

A. His covenant with Abraham.

B. He delivered them from Egyptian slavery.

C. He led them into the promised land.

5. The New Testament analogue is found in 1 Peter I:4. "An inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading."

(This book formed a part of a greater whole which embraced the Deuteronomic narratives extending from the times of the conquest to the kingdom.)

VI. SELECTED TEXTS

1. **Joshua's mandate**. "'As I was with Moses, so I will be with you; I will not fail you or forsake you. Be strong and of good courage.'" 1:5,6.

2. **Spying out Jericho**. "'Go, view the land, especially Jericho.' And they went, and came into the house of a harlot whose name was Rahab, and lodged there." 2:1.

"Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall." 2:15.

3. **Passing over Jordan**. "And while all Israel were passing over on dry ground, the priests who bore the ark...stood on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan, until all the nation finished passing over." 3:17.

"And Achan answered Joshua, 'Of a truth I have sinned...When I saw among the spoil a beautiful mantle...I...took them...they are hidden in the earth inside my tent.'" 7:20,21.

6. **Ambush of Ai**. "The ambush rose quickly out of their place...they ran and entered the city and took it; and they made haste to set the city on fire." 8:19.

7. **Deception of Gibeon**. "The inhabitants of Gibeon...acted with cunning, and went...and took worn-out sacks...patched sandals...and worn-out clothes; and all their provisions were dry and moldy." 9:3-5.

"And Joshua made peace with them, and made a covenant with them, to let them live." 9:15.

"Joshua...said to them, 'Why did you deceive us...some of you shall always be slaves, hewers of wood and drawers of water.'" 9:22,23.

8. **The sun stands still**. "Then spoke Joshua...'Sun, stand thou still at Gibeon'...And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the nation took vengeance on their enemies." 10:12,13.

9. **Victory claims**. "Then the whole congregation of the people of Israel assembled at Shiloh, and set up the tent of meeting there; the land lay subdued before them." 18:1.

10. **Nature of Yahweh**. "Joshua said to the people, 'You cannot serve the Lord, for he is a holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive your transgressions or your sins.'" 24:19.
