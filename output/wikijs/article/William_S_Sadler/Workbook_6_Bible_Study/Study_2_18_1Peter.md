II. AUTHORSHIP

1. There can be little doubt that Peter wrote this letter. Terse 12 of Chapter 5 suggests that Silas (Silvanus) might have written as Peter dictated. This would account for the classic Greek style.

2. Polycarp, Eusebius, and Irenaeus all ascribed the authorship to Peter.

3. This letter shows knowledge of both Ephesians (A.D. 59-60) and Romans (A.D.58).

4. The letter was written from Rome, but Peter used "Babylon" to so disguise it that hostile authorities would not be aroused.

5. The allusion to "feeding the flock" is reminiscent of Jesus' instruction to Peter. John 21:17.

6. The date is somewhere between A.D. 62 and 65-certainly before 67.

III. IN GENERAL

1. The epistle is a gem of both doctrine and ethics.

2. This epistle is one of the finest pieces of work in all of the New Testament. It is profound in both its courage and its piety.

3. The passage (3:19-22) about preaching to the spirits in prison is a reference to a story in the book, of ..Enoch. This, with the reference to preaching to them that are dead (4:6), constitutes the most difficult of all New Testament writings to comprehend. It was, an early belief that Jesus preached in Hades between his death and resurrection.

4. The Apostles' Creed alludes to this passage-"He descended into hell."

5. The Urantia Book alludes to the activities of Jesus during the time of the tomb-see p. 2015.

6. This epistle seems to be sort of a circular letter-like Ephesians-addressed to a group of churches.

7. Peter discusses Christian duties, civic life, married life, and the trials of Christian living.

8. The epistle breathes the spirit of the exuberant Simon Peter.

IV. THEOLOGY

1. The doctrine is the theology of primitive Christianity.

2. The theology of Peter:

A. Old Testament promises are fulfilled.

B. The Messiah has come.

C. He is Jesus of Nazareth.

D. He went about doing good.

E. He was crucified.

F. He was raised from the dead.

G. He" was elevated to God's right hand.

H. He will come again in judgment.

3. The book teaches Paul's atonement.

4. These teachings are parallel with the Gospels:

A. 1:13. Luke 12:35.

B. 1:17. Luke 11:2.

C. 2:12. Matt. 5:16.

D. 3:9. Luke 6:28.

E. 3:14. Matt. 5:10.

F. 4:5. Matt. 12:36.

G. 4:14. Matt. 5:11.

H. 5:6. Luke 14:11.

I. 5:7. Matt. 6:25.

5. The doctrine of God is modern-Creator, Father, and Judge.

6. The doctrine of Christ is thoroughly Pauline.

7. The doctrine of the Spirit is according to the times.

8. The second coming and heaven are also Pauline.
