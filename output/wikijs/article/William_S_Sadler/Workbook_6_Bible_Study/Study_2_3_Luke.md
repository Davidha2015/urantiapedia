III. AUTHORSHIP

1. Luke wrote more than one quarter of the whole New Testament-the book of Luke and the Acts.

2. Luke was an educated man, a physician, and a sometime companion of Paul.

3. He was with Paul on parts of both the second and third missionary tours.

4. He was undoubtedly Paul's private physician-as Paul suffered from several physical ailments. Paul called him the "beloved physician." Col. 4:14.

5. Luke was a good reporter and a fairly good historian. He talked with many eyewitnesses of Jesus' lifework.

6. As might be expected, Luke pays special attention to things of interest to a physician:

The great fever.

Jairus's daughter's eating meat.

The good Samaritan.

First aid.

Prayer miracles.

7. Luke had Matthew (Isador), Mark, and Q (Andrew's notes). About one-third comes from Mark. Along with Matthew he derives much from Q (252 verses), but almost half of Luke is original. He also had Paul's story and a brief record made in A.D. 78 at Antioch by one Cedes. See Urantia Book, [UB 121:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_8).

8. Apparently Luke got many verses from the Cedes manuscript; this document paid special attention to women.

9. The Cedes book was rich in parables: notably, good Samaritan, rich fool, rich man and Lazarus, and the Pharisee and tax collector.

10. Some things in Mark which Luke disregards:

Execution of John the Baptist.

Request of Zebedee sons.

Cursing of the fig tree.

Secretly growing seed.

Saying about greatness.

Question about great commandment.

Anointing at Bethany.

Jesus walking on the sea.

The Syrophoenician woman.

Healings by spittle.

Feeding of 4,000.

11. The original features of Luke are:

Birth narratives. 1:5-2:52.

Parable of the friend at midnight. 11:5-8.

Parables of lost coin and lost son. 15:8-10, 11-32.

Dives and Lazarus. 16:19-31.

Conversion of Zacchaeus. 19:1-10.

Thief on the cross. 23:40-43.

The walk to Emmaus. 24:13-35.

The ascension. 24:50-53.

(And many other minor features.)

12. Luke is the best organized book in the New Testament.

13. While Luke was not a classicist-writing in the international style of Greek-he did write the best literary work of the New Testament, except for the book of Hebrews.

14. Luke's literary skill is best shown in the way he polished up many of Mark's rather crude passages, for example:

**Mark**: "And at even, when the sun did set." Mark 1:32. (King James Version)

**Luke**: "Now when the sun was setting." Luke 4:40. (King James Version)

15. It was never intended that the book of Acts should be separated from Luke.

16. Luke wrote in A.D. 82 at Achaia. He planned to write three books on Christianity, but he died in A.D. 90 just before finishing Acts. Urantia Book, [UB 121:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_8).

17. In a general way, Luke may be said to be the Gospel according to Paul.

IV. HISTORY AND TRADITION IN LUKE

1. Jesus talked in Aramaic, but his followers wrote in Koine Greek.

2. In the times of Jesus, all Jews were bilingual.

3. Peter's Pentecost sermon seems to have set a pattern for all subsequent types of preaching.

4. Paul bases his belief in the resurrection on Jesus' post-resurrection appearances, Mark on the empty tomb, and Matthew on both.

5. Jesus' miracles made a great appeal to the populace.

6. The early spread of the gospel was by "lay preachers."

7. An early church father called Luke "the most beautiful book ever written."

8. The outstanding literary features of Luke are:

A. The Last Supper. 22:15-17.

B. Discourse of true greatness. 22:25-27.

C. Future judges. 22:28-30.

D. Prediction of desertion. 22:31,32.

E. Buying a sword. 22:36-38.

F. On the way to Calvary. 23:28-31.

G. On the road to Emmaus. 24:13-21.

H. Appearance in Jerusalem. 24:36-43.

9. **The Marcion defection**. Marcion was born A.D. 85 in Roman Pontus on the Black Sea. He visited most Christian churches and went to Rome about A.D. 139. He gave $30,000 to the Rome church (later returned) and made a big "stir." He rejected all of the Old Testament. Luke was his gospel -with some writings of his own. He also used some of Paul's letters. Later on, he rewrote Luke. He had Jesus come full-fledgedly from heaven with divine authority on earth. It was Marcion's new testament that forced the "fathers" to get busy with a **real** New Testament.

10. Luke's special motives:

A. To make a good literary production.

B. To make a universal appeal.

C. To be humanitarian (emphasis on the poor).

D. To put emphasis on prayer.

E. To magnify the Holy Spirit.

F. To make clear that Christianity was in no way a subversive religion- get it out of trouble with the Roman authorities.

G. To tell the story with little or no theology. There are few quotations from the Old Testament.
