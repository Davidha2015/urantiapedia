III. AUTHORSHIP

1. John was written in A.D. 101 by Nathan, a Greek Jew from Caesarea, under the direction of John. The book of 1 John was written by John himself as a covering letter. Urantia Book, [UB 121:8.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_10).

2. The fact that Nathan wrote the Gospel enabled John the more gracefully to refer to himself as "the disciple whom Jesus loved."

3. Nathan was probably a mild-mannered man, which would explain how the ambitious young "son of thunder" could have become the "apostle of love.- even in his old age.

4. It is difficult to regard the Gospel of John and Revelation as being written by the same person.

5. John's purpose:

A. To supply what the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke had left out.

B. To bring Christian theology up to date.

C. To control the growing cult of John the Baptist. Some even taught that John was the real Messiah.

D. To withstand Gnosticism, especially the Docetist cult-which denied the incarnation.

6. It is interesting to note what John omits:

A. Account of the baptism.

B. The transfiguration.

C. Agony in Gethsemane.

D. All reference to casting out demons.

E. All parables.

F. Miracles are not acts of compassion, but revelations of divine power.

7. In this book the statement that Jesus was sent by God is made 26 times directly, 18 indirectly. Jesus himself refers to "Him who sent me."

8. John was little influenced by the Old Testament, but greatly influenced by Paul and the book of Hebrews.

9. The appendix does not claim that John was the author.

10. There is some indication that John's manuscript got mixed up before our present-day versions were finally copied.

IV. CHIEF CONSIDERATIONS

1. John is the "crown of the New Testament." It is the most simple and yet the most profound of all the New Testament books.

2. It is the philosophical and theological Gospel-the story is subordinated to doctrine.

3. John recognizes the "humanity" of Jesus, but his divine traits largely overshadow his humanity.

4. In the Synoptics, Jesus gradually arrives at a comprehension of his divine mission. In John, he always knew of the divinity of his bestowal.

5. John plays down the work of John the Baptist and plays up his endorsement of Jesus.

6. John spreads Jesus' ministry over about three years. Mark appears to limit it to about one year.

7. John puts the Last Supper on the evening before the Passover.

8. As regards the chronology of the Last Supper, Paul agrees with John.

9. The Urantia Book agrees with John where he differs from the others on the times of the Last Supper and other events.

10. The Godhead is the center of the theology of John-then the Son (Logos) and the Spirit.

11. John is clearly trinitarian.

12. The high point- "I am the way, and the truth, and the life." 14:6.

13. John makes the only attempt in the Gospels to define God:

- God is spirit.
- God is light.
- God is love.

14. John smacks of determinism. There is much leaning toward predestination.

15. John talks like Paul about the new birth.

16. John does not say much about the "age to come." He seems to think that the "new age" is already here.

17. The author of John is something of a sacramental mystic. He recognizes a church and its ministry.

18. In a way, John is a drama-a conflict between light and darkness, something like the Persian philosophy.

V. CONTEMPORARY RELATIONSHIPS

1. The living Word is the whole concern of the fourth Gospel.

2. The Logos idea was, in part, borrowed from the Stoics.

3. The Logos concept shows Hellenistic influence in general, and Philo in particular.

4. Philo uses Logos to express the personified activity of God.

5. The Logos is "light and life"-even life eternal.

6. Forty years before John, Paul was fighting Gnosticism at Colossae.

7. John is silent about Simon's bearing the cross. One of the Gnostic beliefs was that it was Simon who went to death in the place of Jesus.

8. John was also combatting the "Hermes" cult. This cult produced a work on the "Shepherd of Men," but it was tainted with "speculative Egyptian mysticism." Wisdom is the womb of the "new birth."

9. Some of the Hermes literature was written long after John, but the ideas were early in circulation.

10. John also had in mind the mystery religions which were already in vogue at the time of the writing of his Gospel.

11. Mandaeism. Forty years ago there was discovered in the lower Euphrates a sect of John the Baptist's followers known as the Mandeaans. They are hostile to both Jews and Christians. Christ is alluded to as the "liar" and false Messiah.

12. They claim the true Messiah instigated the crucifixion of Jesus.

13. At the time of John's writing the "cult of the Virgin Mary" had not become widespread-accordingly John ignores the question.
