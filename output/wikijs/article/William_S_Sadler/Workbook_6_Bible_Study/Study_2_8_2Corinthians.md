II. AUTHORSHIP

1. Second Corinthians is Paul's fourth letter. It was written in A.D. 55 from Macedonia.

2. This is the most personal of all of Paul's letters to the churches.

3. This 2 Corinthians-the fourth letter-has been called the "thankful" epistle.

4. Some have thought that 2 Cor. 6:14-7:1 is a fragment from the first letter.

5. Paul's third letter (largely lost) was a severe rebuke-and seems to have been effective.

6. This stern letter was probably written from Ephesus and sent by Titus.

7. Some believe that 2 Cor. Chapters 10-13 are a fragment of the stem third letter. This is hardly an appropriate way to end a "thankful" letter to a reunited church.

III. CENTRAL THEMES

1. We do not have a very clear picture of Just what Paul's detractors were preaching. One thing certain, they were hard at work to undermine Paul's influence and status.

2. They accused Paul of being "tricky and insincere," weak in voice and appearance, having "visions," and being "mentally unbalanced."

3. Paul denounced his adversaries as being "domineering, arrogant, greedy, and brutal." He would hardly admit that they were "Christians."

4. Paul's collection for the Jerusalem church was a strategic move to promote Jewish-gentile unity.

5. **Major theme**\-God and Father of the Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and the God of all comfort.

6. He did not belittle Satan-called him "God of this world."

7. He presents the Christ, who "was rich," but for our sake "became poor."

8. The new order of God, through Christ, is the gift of the Holy Spirit.

9. Paul recognizes the Old Testament as "scripture," but Christ is its fulfillment.

10. He portrays the "mission of suffering." His power is "made perfect in weakness."

11. Hope is the twin of true faith.

12. Prayer is the mainstay of religion.

13. Christian giving-charity.

14. He admits his own afflictions and his "thorn in the flesh."

15. He glories in his infirmities.

16. Paul does not hesitate to make a bold and courageous defense of himself.

17. God lives and works in man. The body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.

18. Jesus is a unique revelation of God.
