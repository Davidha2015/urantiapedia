J
Jehovah

Jehovah is a term which in recent times has been employed to designate the completed concept of Yahweh which finally evolved in the long Hebrew experience. But the name Jehovah did not come into use until fifteen hundred years after the times of Jesus. (1053.8) 96:1.10

Jesus

Jesus is the new and living way from man to God, from the partial to the perfect, from the earthly to the heavenly, from time to eternity. (1425.6) 129:4.7

Judgment

The final application of justice in accordance with the evidence (114.5) 10:6.4

Justice

Justice is inherent in the universal sovereignty of the Paradise trinity, but goodness, mercy, and truth are the universe ministry of the divine personalities, whose Deity union constitutes the Trinity.Justice is not the attitude of the Father, the Son, or the Spirit. Justice is the Trinity attitude of these personalities of love, mercy, and ministry. No one of the paradise Deities fosters the administration of justice. Justice is never a personal attitude; it is always a plural function. (114.3) 10:6.2

Justice is the collective thought of righteousness; mercy is its personal expression. (115.2) 10:6.18

Natural justice is a man-made theory; it is not a reality, In nature, justice is purely theoretic, wholly a fiction. Nature provides but one kind of justice—inevitable conformity to causes.

Justice, as conceived by man, means getting one’s rights and has, therefore, been a matter of progressive evolution. The concept of justice may well be constitutive in a spirit-endowed mind, but it does not spring full-fledgedly into existence on the worlds of space. (794.13) 70:10.1
