## “Thought For The Month” 

> “Modern religion finds it difficult to adjust its attitude toward the rapidly shifting social changes only because it has permitted itself to become so thoroughly traditionalized, dogmatized, and institutionalized. The religion of living experience finds no difficulty in keeping ahead of all these social developments and economic upheavals, amid which it ever functions as a moral stabilizer, social guide, and spiritual pilot. True religion carries over from one age to another the worth-while culture and that wisdom which is born of the experience of knowing God and striving to be like him.” _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 99:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2_6)

## The Area Coordinator Programme

The URANTIA Brotherhood Administration has been considering for some time a suitable way of facilitating contact between study group, individual readers and the Brotherhood, and has finally begun to appoint Area Coordinators, replacing Field Representatives, and vastly increasing the number of appointees. Appointments are for a fixed three year term.

An Area Coordinator has been appointed for Australia and New Zealand, and as I hold that appointment for the next three years, it seems a good time to explain something about the programme.

The primary purpose of the Area Coordinator is to provide a connection between study groups in his area and to assist them in any way possible. This includes receiving referrals from Chicago, where most new readers first enquire for information, and helping them locate other readers in their vicinity. The idea is, over a period of time, to build up a bank of information about the local readership which can be updated by subsequent Area Coordinators and used to facilitate the interaction of individual readers and study groups.

In addition, the Area Coordinator is expected to be familiar with key policies of URANTIA Brotherhood and to be a point of contact between the local readership and the International Fellowship Committee, of which Neil Francey is currently a member, and Berkeley Elliott the President. The Area Coordinator submits a report to the International Fellowship Committee each year.

I t should be emphasised that the Area Coordinator has no authority to represent the URANTIA Brotherhood in matters of policy. Neither does his opinion count for any more than any other readers'. His function is to assist, facilitate and coordinate, not to dictate, coerce or cajole. But he does want to help, if you want to make use of him!

## Greetings From U.S.S.R.

Our local I-I-group (Independent Investigators) sends you our best wishes from Tallinn on the Southern shore of the Finnish Gulf.

Our Urantia research is going on in full swing, how about you? We welcome everybody who is interested and keen in the Urantia research or any other subjects, having to do with personal spiritual experience of Man and spiritual awakening of Mankind.

Hope to hear from you. God bless you.

## The Father Idea

During my second year of reading _The URANTIA Book_ I happened to be teaching in a school for the mildly intellectually handicapped. One day whilst I was supervising in the Playground, two fourteen-year-old girls approached me and asked, “Can you tell us what happens to you when you die?” I remember telling the girls that I had been taught we go to “heaven” where we continue to live. Sensing that this answer was unsatisfactory I briefly stated that I had done much reading and study on the subject and had discovered that we have a “soul” which is our real self. Then we die our body stays here but our soul and personality are sent to another world by God's helpers where we are given a new body and where we continue our lives.

One girl replied that she had been taught the same thing at Sunday school. However, the other girl stated emphatical1y: “I don't believe that I” I then asked: “Who do we pray to?” She replied: “God”, to which I asked: 'What other name do we call Him?“' She thought for a moment but could not find an answer. The other girl answered: 'We call Him our Father”. I then stated that if God is our Father, then we must be his children. They both more or less agreed. My next question was directed towards the unbelieving girl. I asked: “If you were God and loved your children very much, would you want them to die and exist no more or would you want them to live?” They both agreed they would not want their children to cease to exist. The unbelieving girl still found it difficult to visualise or believe that God is a loving Father who has pre pared a special place for his children.

Apparently this student never knew her own father or the love of one as she was put into an institution at an early age. Her own father had been in jail for same time and her mother could not cope with a large family. The other girl had come from a better home background and had received some spiritual training.

I have now had nearly 20 years to reflect on the technique I used to answer their question and I still believe I would answer any similar question the same way.

Has any URANTIA Book reader ever come across a book written by a German, possibly called 'The Oscillating Universe"? I believe he put forward the theory in the early 20th century that the universe expands and contracts. I would be interested to know if anyone has heard of it.

## World Population

By the time you finish reading this sentence the population of Urantia will increase by 7 persons! By the time you finish reading this article the population of the world will increase by more than 2,500. By this time tomorrow it will increase over 190,000 ... that's 1,300,000 per week ... 6,000,000 more one month from now: 72,000,000 a year!

We have all seen figures like these. What do they mean? Are they true? How will this affect us ? Are there already signs of overpopulation? What should our role be in shaping world policy or opinion? What does _The URANTIA Book_ say about population? Is this a problem serious enough to be concerned about?

This article will address these and other questions, facts, opinions, trends, and solutions of population dymamics, the future of the brotherhood of man on Urantia.

### Facts And Figures

The current population of America is over 245 million. With an expansion rate of 2.3 million in 1987 , over 18 million since 1980 , in the year 2000 we will have about 275 million people in the United States. Although net immigration accounts for about 251 of this increase, that figure is falling due to stricter governmental control. The birth rate is 15.6 / 1000 while the death rate is 8.7 / 1000 for a net increase of 6.9 additional persons per 1000 already present. At this rate we will have 320 million people by 2025: 308 more in only 37 years.

In the developed countries population grows at a slower rate than the rest of the world due to a higher standard of living, better government, advanced education and other factors. Estimates of population for this segment are 1.2 billion in 1990,1.3 billion in 2000 , and up to 1.4 billion by 2025. The birth rate among these industrial nations is about 16 / 1000 as a whole, and the death rate is 9 / 1000, yielding an increase of 7 persons per 1000 inhabitants.

The shocking figures cane from the underdeveloped segment of our planet. Lagging behind in education, industry, and standard of living, this area is far greater in population than the developed portion. Estimates here nun at 4 billion by 1990,4.9 billion by 2000 , and 6.8 billion by the year 2025. The birth rate among these people is about 33 / 1000 and the death rate only 12 / 1000, giving a net increase of 21 / 1000 inhabitants. This is contrasted to the net increase of 7 / 1000 in the developed areas. To illustrate this point, the United Nations has projected China will have 1.5 billion people by 2025, India 1.3 billion, and Nigeria 321 million more than the USA!

As we became wore and more world minded, we begin to look at concepts with a more mature eye. Indeed, we are told that for real progress to take place, a sphere must develop one language, one religion, one philosophy and one world government, [UB 55:3.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p3_22). So it is right to study global problems in a global context. With the exception of a few individuals orbiting the planet, we are all confined to a finite living space. We are all connected. We are all members of a worldwide brotherhood of man. Your problem is ay problem. Their problem is our problem.

And the problem is world population growth. A recent newspaper article had a lead sentence that said, “By the rime they reach middle age, Americans born today could be sharing the planet with twice the current number of people.” In 1974 world population was 4 billion. It is now over 5 billion. Conservative estimates show by the year 2000 6 billion; and by 2025 8 billion. Seventy-five percent of that growth will come from underdeveloped nations.

### Trends

Trends in population are more alarming than estimates of the recent past have predicted. The overall growth trend has not been following the standard projections. The anticipated decline in birth rates in many underdeveloped countries has not been as great as hoped for. The global population has been rising FASTER than previously anticipated. A 1963 UN conservative projection was for the world to reach 5 billion in 1993. We made it in 1987. A 1962 book I read assumed that with global policies we might be able to hold world population to about 5 billion by the year 2000. Of course, we have surpassed that mark 13 years in advance.

The ultimate trend for population prediction is called the doubling rate. The population of the world was about 5 million in 8000 B.C. (_The URANTIA Book_ says world population was about &frac12; billion 5000,000 years B.C., [UB 66:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p0_2)). In A.D. 1, world population was 250 million; 500 million in 650 ; 1 billion in 1850; 2 billion in 1930; and 4 billion in 1974. That puts the current doubling rate at about 40 years. From this, we could assume the number of people alive on Urantia will be over 8 billion by the year 2025.

Many people do not want to hear this kind of information, however. It has been said that the essence of genius is to allign oneself with the inevitable. If this is so, we have same shortage of genius. A recent editorial I read stated that overpopulation is nothing but a myth propagated by the highly educated through sheer repetition, rhetoric, vehemence and propaganda. It said the facts are completely counter to the hysteria: that the world's food supply is growing consistently faster than the world's population, and vast amounts of fertile land remain unused even in the third world countries. (Consumption is rising and the soil is so poor in reclaimed rain forests it will only grow crops for 5 years.) It also said all the people on the planet could be housed in Texas in one-story, single family homes, at a population density less than that of same American cities! (They would need 2 stories and double family homes in 40 years.) It stated that natural resources will last for untold centuries;coal for over 1000 years. (a 1980 source shows world reserves of natural gas at 47 years, oil 34 years, and coal, a chief component of air pollution and acid rain, 1,600 years — assuming no growth in consumption rates.)

There is a perception that world population growth is a problem of the 1970 's, or a myth that the world gloom and doomers propagate for some personal gain. This is the reason that the Population Reference Bureau published their World Population Data Sheet revealing that worldwide population is still growing faster than has been projected. The growth rate is at 1.7 percent annually. The real problem is that the base is ever widening. While 1.7% of 4 billion is 68 million, 1.78 of 5 billion is 85 million additional persons, and 1.78 of 6 billion is 105 million per year. If this trend continues, in a few years we arrive at a rate of an additional billion every decade. If you extend this rate over the next 600 years there would be less than 10 square feet of land left for each person:standing room only!

Even if fertility rates came down to replacement level immediately, the population would more than double before finally stabilizing due to the large numbers of young people entering their reproductive years. Roughly half of the people of the underdeveloped world are under age 17 . Over 758 of the world population is contained in low and middle income countries with total fertility rates in the 4.0 to 7.0 range. For example, in an Africa of 93 million child bearable women and a birth rate of 47 / 1000,19 million children were born in 1975. With a birth rate of only 25 / 1000,42 million will be born in 2025 as there will be 430 million reproductive-age women. If you think this is a bit much, pause to consider the inevitable — a recent survey reported that 8 out of 10 adult Tunisians did not know a single method of contraception.

But is this problem real? Is it serious? What associated symptons are evident, and what are their implications?

### Symptoms

We often overlook the symptoms of population pressure. A recent $A P$ article stated that on any given night in America 735,000 people are homeless. While male alcoholics and mental patients make up the largest portion of the homeless, the fastest growing group is made up of children under 18: over 100,000 a night, NOT including runaways, throwaways, or abandoned children. Among other causes the study cited the policies of state mental hospitals, rehabilitation facilities, and jails and prisons that admit fewer and free more previously held. In Tennessee, prison and jail crowding has prompted releasing criminals back into society. In Virginia, a state law that called for sterilizing mental patients was recently repealed.

Population growth is even supported and encouraged by various means. Our dependent tax deduction actually subsidizes additional children. (Sixty-one other countries also offer rewards to those having children.) As recently as 1965 Connecticut had laws making it illegal for druggists or doctors to dispense contraceptives. A recent Knoxville news article said that health organizations and schools are so scared of offending someone they won't even say the ‘C’ word: (Condom!) Even though more teenage girls drop out of school because of pregnancy than any other reason, sex-education is not taught consistently in school or at home. On [UB 84:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_5) the revelators say many modern parents strive to keep their children ignorant as to the origin of human life. And religious taboos of birth control are beyond the scope of this paper.

In a book about problems on the USA, a noted author and educator stated that nobody planned that social welfare would reinforce and increase the problems it was established to eliminate. No one planned the population explosion that resulted as a side effect of improved medicine and chemistry. No one realized that the ultimate outcome of our abundance would be a state of affluent poverty. The key here is that NO ONE PLANNED.

A recent anti-abortion demonstration in Atlanta only served to accentuate the problem of 3,000,000 unwanted babies a year in America, about half of which are aborted. Attacks on the Planned Parenthood Federation also underscore the rising problem of uncontrolled populace. While accused of trying to create a master race and eliminate undesirables from society, this organization claims to give people the means to voluntarily plan childbirth and protect their reproductive health. A documentary on USA population reported that children of single parent families constitute the fastest growing group of children in the USA. _The URANTIA Book_ says that marriage is the mother of all human institutions, family the master civilizer, and home the crowning glory of evolution, [UB 82:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/82#p0_1), [UB 84:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_8), [UB 84:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_6). But this group is without the first and only has half the second. Planned parenthood is being blamed for helping underclass, poor, minority women because they are allegedly trying to clean up the gene pool.

A CBS news broadcast revealed the problem in America. They called it a population explosion. Nearly 350,000 crack-babies will be born in the USA this year. Their mothers, hooked on cocaine or crack, and unable or unwilling to care for them, are dumping these tiny addicts on the social systems of our country in overwhelming numbers. One social worker, calling then tomorrows delinquents, predicted this group would over-burden every social system they came in contact with in their life, so great were their numbers and so great their need for special care. Most, permanently affected by the drugs their mothers took, are slow or retarded and unable to reach normal potential. Many, we to the IV needle use and sex practices of their mothers, carry the HIV virus. A grandmother interviewed while caring for a crack-grandchild her daughter had dumped on her, said: “She could have aborted this baby. It didn't have to become a burden on society.” The mother, found standing on a corner, tears running down one cheek, said she just couldn't care for the child. She was back on crack, back on the street, and pregnant again!

Though this is not a paper on eugenics, it is inseparable from a paper on population. There are over 70 passages in _The URANTIA Book_ on the subject, and the recurring theme is that many of this planet's more pressing problems have been created and perpetuated by our failure to remove the defective and degenerate strains from the world's gene pool.It speaks of our errors of judgement on [UB 70:9.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/70#p9_14). “The survival of large numbers of defectives and degenerates is not because they have any natural right thus to encumber twentieth century civilization, but because the society of the age, the mores, thus decrees.” It goes on to say: “Society cannot offer equal rights to all, but it can promise to administer the varying rights of each with fairness and equity.” So our dilemma is understood; our attitudes predicted upon the history of the idealism of evolved religion. But now we have a revealed religion, and we may already have help in doing that which we have not been able to do alone.

Some think this problem of eugenics is the single most pressing social issue addressed in _The URANTIA Book_. Perhaps in a few years we will know more about this strange and elusive disease of AIDS. Perhaps then we will understand the passage on [UB 110:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_6), “... the supervising personalities of Satania look with favor upon the proposals of some of your more immediate planetary supervisors who advocate the inauguration of measures designed to foster and conserve the higher spiritual types of the Urantia races.”

A recent CNN report stated that despite unprecedented health campaigns, AIDS was now being transmitted heterosexually among the people of the underdeveloped countries(like Haiti and several African states). It said the disease was everywhere among these populations, and very likely would be as decimating as the medieval scourges of plague and smallpox. But, where these were carried out over years, AIDS would be carried out over decades and generations. Worldwide, AIDS seems to strike most at the poor, the undereducated, and the crowded.

### Pollution

Poisoned people are not the only symptons of overpopulation; poisoned environment is also becoming more evident. When I was there in 1977, the western slope of Mt. Mitchell, in North Carolina, was beautiful and fully covered with healthy looking trees. Today, what trees still stand there are dead or dying. Aluminium deposits have been found among dying evergreens of The Smokey Mountains, indicating that acid has leached it from the soil. In Sweden lakes are being doused with massive quantities of antacids to try and save them. Woods Lake in NY, was inhabited by only 2 swallows and 2 bullfrogs in a 1986 count.

In Germany, where population density is even more pronounced and forests more precious, trees are color marked dying and dead. The number of blue and rod marked trees has the people of this country saddened and scared. The very nature of technology and progress has turned their daily walk into an inspection tour of the tainted fruits of modern society. They must preserve their forests to maintain the ecology of their land, but their autobahns cut through the Schwarzwald and carry nitrous and sulfuric oxide emitting symbols of personal freedom and status at over 100 mph. One German mother remarked to me, 'What about our children, and their children? They will have no trees to walk among!"

The pollution problem is not limited to these areas, however, and it is made up of more than dying trees, acid rain, and dead lakes.It is everywhere, in greater quantities, everyday. In the IISA we are taking fresh water out of the ground twice as fast as natural processes are replacing it, steadily diminishing our irreplacable clean water supply. Just last month all shellfish from Pugeot Sound were withdrawn from stores as they were found contaminated. Fish caught of the coast of LA exhibit tumors and toxins. A lake near my home has signs warning fishermen not to eat their catch. A Boston legislator recently discovered the muck he was cleaning from his jogging shoes was human excrement from Boston Bay. The total amount of garbage, waste, toxins, contaminants and industrial fluids pumped into our streams, lakes, rivers and oceans is incredible: a billion gallons of effluent daily from Boston alone. Yet most people think nothing of wasting five gallons of clean water every time they flush.

Barges of garbage with destination your back yard sail perilously on. Bags of needles and diseased blood float up on the shore of New York. Dolphins by the hundreds wash up on the Atlantic coast, victims of some strange waterborne disease. The waters surrounding Tahiti are inhabited only by brittle starfish, a sure sign of pollution, as their island, denuded of forest by energy starved natives, washes into the sea. Children of Naples swim among garbage in the surf. Radioactive waste, mercury, thermal pollution, ozone holes, ozone clouds, smog, the greenhouse effect, disappearing forests, me1ting statues, CO~2~, PCB, NO~2~, SO~2~, H~2SO~4~, HNO~3~, etc, etc. And more comes with every additional person. One researcher said it looked like one gigantic experiment to poison one hemisphere and see what happened.

Over 50 tons of rubber are laid down on the streets of Los Angeles every day. China plans to double its production of coal in the next 15 years. Urban planners have predicted the first national traffic grid-lock sometime in the early twenty-first century. In 15 years the Amazon rain forest may be gone. The isolated tribes of inner Borneo are no longer isolated, and the Orangutans are scrambling to find a tree they are not cutting today. And the chainsaws cut continuously.

### Hunger

World hunger is another measure of the effect of population dynamics. Although some would say it's only a matter of distribution, the evidence shows otherwise. One-third of the world's population consumes two-thirds of the food production. of the current estimated 30 million ton average growth in world grain output, 22 million tons are absorbed by population growth and 8 million by rising per capita incomes(leading to rising per capita demand and consumption) Per capita consumption will double by the year 2000. It has been stated that if all the food in the world were distributed equally, everyone would be malnourished.

The world demand for food, expanded by both population growth and rising affluence, is outstripping world food production, resulting in a drawing down of world food reserves, an increase of world food prices and a growing instability in the world economy. The Green Revolution of the early 1970's has not prevented most of the world's food problems as predicted. Recent droughts indicate just how precarious the situation might become with extended changes in the weather. The haunting television views of starving refugees: children with bellies swollen from kwashiorkor. The extremely poor of the world are growing, and they are hungry. Seven million orphans in Brazil; 1.2 million refugees in the Sudan. Countless homeless and penniless in Bangladesh. Satiated animals that walk among the starving of Calcutta.

### War

Another sign of overpopulation is war. An American Senator recently stated there were 36 wars raging on the surface of our planet. From the concept of ‘lebensraum’ to the holy jihad, modern era people have been fighting to take over land for expansion of their country. _The URANTIA Book_ says that multiplication of numbers beyond the optimum of the normal land-man ratio means either a lowering of the standard of living or immediate expansion of territorial boundaries, [UB 81:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_12). On [UB 68:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_3) it says that during periods of land scarcity and associated overpopulation, human life becomes comparatively cheapened so that war, famine, and pestilence are regarded with less concern. This reminds me of the government of Ethiopia, which recently let perishable foodstuffs sit on their docks and rot, while they transported tons of concrete and steel to their cities to build statues for a government anniversary ceremony. They are not concerned with their dying millions. Wars of attrition are fought to reduce population and increase the pocketbooks of the weapon makers. Government red tape consistently slows down aid shipments to ravaged areas and millions die in the meantime.

We now have enough nuclear warheads stockpiled to kill everyone in the world three times: 15 tans of TNT explosive power for every person on the planet. But most of the undeveloped countries of the world do not YET have the bomb. Can we expect this segment of three-quarters of the world's population to quietly stand in ever lengthening bread lines until they slowly sink into oblivion, while the rich one quarter of the world fights for a parking place at the super-market?

### Affluence — Consumption

Not too many years ago a telephone, television, and family car were luxury items. I remember crowds of people flocking to our house to watch those fuzzy pictures on the little screen. To get to the phone was tough with all the clamour to talk. A Sunday afternoon drive with the family was a joyous affair. Today, people look at you like you are crazy if you don't have a phone. I don't know anyone without a TV, and a drive can be a nerve wracking experience. I am down to three TV's and two phones, but I have a VCR, computer with disk drive and printer, 3 radios, and a complete stereo with cassette, reel-to-reel, and two turntables. I plan to add a compact disc player or DAT. I have two cars and numerous appliances. The wife wants to add a swimming pool. There are only three of us.

Between 1944 and 1984, the population of the USA increased 728. In the same time period the energy consumption increased 24008. Much of the world has just been brought out of the uncivilized stage by modern medicine and technology. Through the use of pesticides, herbicides and antibiotics, we have saved untold millions. We have convinced those that wandered to settle in one place, dig a well, and plant crops. We have dressed them in funny clothes, given them mirrors and combs and books, and we have tried to teach them our way. We have even now given them a community TV. I have seen crowds of them intently watching a little TV sitting on top of a post in the centre of the village by the well.I wonder when they will get their first phone?

### Carrying Capacity

The last evidence of overpopulation to be addressed is carrying capacity. When a closed population reaches the carrying capacity of its environment, the population is supposed to stabilize to equilibrium. However, if the carrying capacity is exceeded, the population can drop dramatically to a much lower sustainable level or even extinction. Changes in the environment can alter this carrying capacity: toxic wastes, pollution, temperature, food, etc. Certain things like fertilizers can increase the carrying capacity temporarily, although their side effects can be disastrous if uncontrolled. Chemical runoff from fans and industry is ruining much of our water and 1and. An October report by the Wilderness Society states that nearly all of their 445 refuges where birds, fish, and wild animals are supposed to be protected from the ravages of mankind, are damaged or blighted by toxic chemicals, pesticides, water diversion, wetlands drainage, oil drilling, offroad vehicles, and other human incursions. They are using shot guns and explosives to scare away migratory birds for their own sake.

If the carrying capacity is being lowered while the growth rate is at its highest the results could be disastrous. The growth of population is exponential, not arithmetic, and the curve on the graph is now pointed straight up. On [UB 68:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_11) _The URANTIA Book_ says: "From a world standpoint, overpopulation has never been a serious problem in the past, but if war is lessened and science increasingly controls human diseases, it may become a serious problem in the near future. At such a time the great test of the wisdom of world leadership will present itself. Will Urantia rulers have the insight and courage to foster the multiplication of the average or stabilized human being instead of the extremes of the supernormal and the enormously increasing groups of the subnormal.

### Conclusions

Overpopulation is a fact. Japan's 123 million are already planning to build concrete islands in the ocean. Immigration laws are becoming more strict in developed countries as the haves warily eye the have-nots trying desperately to get away from their dilemma and into ours. The underdeveloped countries' birth rate is still high, but we have helped them cut their death rate without the accompanying benefit of means to sustain their increased numbers. The environment is steadily being raped, plundered, and poisoned to the point that portions of it may take years to recover if at all. Yet the population is still growing. If we fail to control the growth and ultimate stabilization of the world's population, our planet will be decimated. The quality of life will fall to an intolerable sub-human level, and the job will be done for us inevitably by another force such as war, disease, or extinction.

On [UB 68:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_4) it says: “When the land yield is reduced or the population is increased, the inevitable struggle is renewed; the very worst traits of human nature are brought to the surface.” It explains that: “When standards of living became too complicated or too highly luxurious, they speedily became suicidal.” ([UB 68:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_7)) on [UB 81:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_11) they state that: “... failure to increase in numbers up to a certain point prevents the full realization of national destiny, there comes a point in population increase where further growth is suicidal.”

## Solutions

So what is the answer? What can we do to help ourselves? We are also instructed in this case by the revelators. “The improvement of the land yield, the extension of the mechanical arts, and the REDUCTION OF POPULATION (emphasis mine) all tend to foster the development of the better side of human nature”. ([UB 68:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/68#p6_4)) “The optimum stabilization of national population enhances culture and prevents war.” ([UB 81:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_12)) “But the continent richest in natural deposits and the most advanced mechanical equipment will make little progress if the intelligence of its people is on the decline. Knowledge can be had by education, but wisdom, which is indispensable to true culture, can be secured only through experience and by men and women who are innately intelligent.” ([UB 81:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_13)) “And it is a wise nation which knows when to stop growing”. ([UB 81:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_12)) The world is our nation. Will we also became wise?

One renowned educator has stated that the only successful way out of the present crisis is to break through to a new and more advanced civilization. What confronts us now is not a problem of energy, population, or pollution. The symptoms appear in the environment but the disease is human behaviour, motivated by false notions of growth and progress.

There are only two ways to stop the growth of population: decrease the birth rate or increase the death rate. Either we make the choice or the choice will be made for us. the resources of the world are finite. The environment is not completely resilient to the abusive actions of careless humans. The carrying capacity of specific areas has already been exceeded and there are signs of its lowering worldwide. The rate of consumption is rising. The rate of pollution is rising. Degeneracy is rising. Population is rising.

There are only two ways to stop the growth of population.

## Dear Friends

My partner, David Hepworth, and I have been keen readers of _The URANTIA Book_ for some time and we find it increasingly a source of inspiration in our lives. One aspect which particularly appeals to us is the role that work plays in spiritual development and the need for the service motive to augment the profit motive.

We notice that already there is a shift in attitudes in the business world to being more cooperative and holistic, based on higher ideals, rather than being based on self-centred needs.

We are attempting to apply these principles in our own marketing consultancy and into the businesses of our clients. While we are some way down the track, we would be delighted to correspond with other readers of the Six-0-Six Newsletter who may have similar intentions and experience in this area so we can share ideas and try to contribute to the progress of the trend.

## Why Aren't They Knocking On My Door?

> “The extent to which you have to go with your message to the people is, in a way, the measure of your failure to live the whole or righteous life, the truth-co-ordinated life.” ([UB 155:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_5))

Maybe people are knocking on your door, asking what you have got and how they can acquire it, but they are giving mine a wide berth.

And out there in the big world I have had a few people observe a difference between me and themselves which they all labeled “crazy”! I have never found this perturbing because I totally respect the right of my brothers and sisters to call me what they will. But what makes me a little frustrated is that I have obviously not reached the stage where God shines through me, where I have this beautiful wholeness of righteousness which Jesus refers to on UB 155:1.5.

I would like to suggest, through 6-0-6, that we start accumulating ideas and hypothesis for what is “wrong” with folks like me.

[UB 102:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_4) of _The URANTIA Book_ says : “Religious experience is the realization of the consciousness of having found cod. And when a human being does find cod, there is experienced within the soul of that being such an indescribable restlessness of triumph in discovery that he is impelled to seek loving service-contact with his less illuminated fellows, not to disclose that he has found God, but rather to allow the overflow of the welling-up of eternal goodness within his own soul to refresh and ennoble his fellows. Real religion leads to increased social service.”

I just love talking about our Father and I have a few friends (non URANTIA Book readers) who are dedicatedly religious. One, in deep disgust, one day announced: “Am, all the churches are going to really have to clean up their act. They dare to make God a human God!”

I had hardly time to add any “hear! hear!” when she, with true enthusiastic zeal, continued: “They dare to say that God does not get angry. They paint a milksop God who is all love!”

I smiled to myself — if only the major emotion was love.

Back to my subject: “The element of error present in human religious experience is directly proportional to the content of materialism which contaminates the spiritual concept of the Universal Father. Man's prespirit progression in the universe consists in the experience of divesting himself of these erroneous ideas of the nature of God and of the reality of pure and true spirit. Deity is more than spirit, but the spiritual approach is the only one possible to ascending man.” ([UB 102:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p4_4))

I guess most of us had rather a confused idea of God if we were reared in evolutional religion. But, for myself, when I read, and each time I reread the first section on God, something sings inside me. My mind says — boy I would like to really understand how this is so, but I have no doubt that this is all truth, and a very good description of our Paradise Father. I appreciate so much more His — I cannot find the right words except — perfection, greatness, epitome of truth, beauty, goodness and, accepting and recognising Him in all His majesty, the book makes Him more lovable, more approachable despite the fact that he has zillions of planets, instead of the Bible idea of just one, which he was going to destroy anyway! (so what's wrong with denuding it — destroying sea, forest, etc. — let's get in before God does!)

Maybe my problem is that in my cesspool of emotions i an still clinging to characteristics of God from the old days. To my conscious knowledge this is not so. Maybe it is not that I am still “humanising” God, maybe I am confused on the Father — child images. Maybe I need a lot more education and growth in truth, beauty and goodness. Perhaps I've got to learn to love more with intelligence and wisdom.

We are told the giver of the golden thought likewise has the means of its manifestation — so if they are not knocking on my door, I must have a lot more to learn.

If there is any 6-0-6 reader who has his/her door regularly knocked on, could you give me a few practical tips! And please don't tell me I'm impatient. Our Father knows what a hard lesson patience has been for me to learn. Maybe I am interpreting the book too simplistically, but I know I love God as my Paradise Father, and I love all His kids, and His will is my will, and so I am tossing the quandary to you readers for suggestions.

I shall pass through this world but once, 
Any good therefore that I can do 
Or any kindness that I can show
To a fellow creature, 
Let me do it now, 
Let me not defer or neglect it 
For I shall not pass this way again.
