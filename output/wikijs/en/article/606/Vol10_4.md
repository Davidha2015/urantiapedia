## “Thought For The Month” 

> “The religious challenge of this age is to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness. Such a new and righteous vision of morality will attract all that is good in the mind of man and challenge that which is best in the human soul. Truth, beauty, and goodness are divine realities, and as man ascends the scale of spiritual living, these supreme qualities of the Eternal become increasingly co-ordinated and unified in God, who is love.” _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10)

## Letters To The Editor

“Always does the socialized religion of a new revelation pay the price of compromise with the established forms and usages of the preceding religion which it seeks to salvage.”(_The URANTIA Book_, [UB 144:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p7_1))

Dear People,

I am writing this letter to as many directors as possible, for I believe we are in the process of making a grave error that will harm the cause of _The URANTIA Book_. I realize that the creation of the magazine “Life After Death” plus the “Introduction” booklets (20th Century Revelation) were done with tenderhearted love and good intentions (ideals are most important, not ideas), but ideas can cause great harm. We know what happened with Christian history. Shortly after the death of Jesus, the pagan superstitions of evolutionary religion were incorporated into and onto the teachings of Jesus and today Christianity is largely paganism with the name of Christ stamped on it. We must not make the same mistake with _The URANTIA Book_.

1) On page 6 of the magazine there is a picture of an angel with wing and feathe rs and a “halo” with strange clothes and it is a woman! This is something we see on a stained glass window of a church. The URANIIA Book says angels do not have wing (let alone feathers!) True, transport angels have shields but that is not wings (transport angels don't carry people's souls to the first mansion world, anyway). The book may use the term “she” as a type of negative/positive — agressive/passive, but that does not mean they are women. The angel on page 9 looks like a chubby 16-year-old girl playing a viol in (not to mention page 15 of the magazine). In the Introduction booklet the angel is struming a guitar (page 4). We must leave old ideas (tradition) about angels out of books, magazines, etc., as people will think _The URANTIA Book_ teaches this stuff and will reject it.
2) There is a picture of a group of Christians with candles on page 8 of the Introduction booklet. Candles in religious services are a carry-over from the sacred fires/ghosts/fears of long ago. This is a 20th Century Revelation, not superstition. We m u s leave this kind of picture out.
3) The pictures of Jesus in the magazine, booklets and pamphlets have him with long hair like the traditional Jesus. _The URANTIA Book_ speaks out against this sort of thing. Jesus looked like a Jew of his day. It was a shame for men to have long hair like this in that day. Some took a Nazarite vow and let their hair grow like Samson or John the Baptist, until they fulfilled the vow, but Jesus was not a Nazarite. The Jews had a style more like the Romans of that time. We must not make pictures of Jesus like this or people will think the URANTIA Book teaches this image ([UB 141:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p3_6), _The URANTIA Book_).
4) The pictures of the seven superuniverses are $v e r y d i s t u r b$ in g. Did you contact an astronomer to see if this kind of thing exists out there? Astronomy is a love of mine, and l went over all the things in the books on the subject and got a different picture altogether. The closest large galaxy to us is Andromeda to the north (#1?). We can see it with the naked eye and it's very large even with a cheap telescope. It is moving ahead of us, but it is much farther away than in the pictures (and there is none in between). If there were seven pieplate spiral galaxies like this picture, this close to us, we would see some ahead and behind (except through the Milky way as it has too many stars to see through). Where are they? Plus there would be unpervaded space above us if we had Sagittarius to our left and the first ring to our right — where is it? The book did not say they are all spiral galaxies. There are many types of galaxies. Plus, if they were this close, the gravity would be a disruptive factor. Remember, Orvonton is the entire gravitational pull of the Milky Way, which goes out much farther than the spiral, carrying tramp galaxies and star clusters, etc. The book also says all seven are in an ellipse, not a circle. I could go into more detail, but I don't want to appear redundant. Kemenber, astronomers are going to see this picture too (is it real?) I think it is very wise to leave

“ideas” about angels, Jesus, customs, and science out of the literature until we can prove it to all who may tilke us to task on it, such as scientists, historians, etc. We don't want to sink the ship before it gets out of the harbor. Soon there will be many “ideas” a b o $u t$ _The URANTIA Book_ like “ideas” about the Bible. We may not be able to stop it, but we don't want to start it. The rest of the pictures about the family, love, hope, are great.

I know this was a strong and long letter which sounds negative, but I did it on purpose to get your attention, for I love _The URANTIA Book_ and I don't want to see it misunderstood. Have a good day and Good health. May God bless us all.

Let's let the book interpret itself.

Dear Brothers and Sisters,

This letter is a warning cry about the dangers of pamphlets and brochures as a device to introduce _The URANTIA Book_ to new readers. I think that anything less than _The URANTIA Book_ itself as an introduction to the book is inherently wrong. Any human effort to entice people to read the book is prone to error. A case in point is the magazine put out by the Jesusonian Foundation in Boulder, Colorado.

First impressions and initial images can hold strong sway with anyone. Colored photos of chubby teenage girls with medieval dress represented as angels is just the kind of image I do n o t want associated with _The URANTIA Book_. It conjures up all of the superstitious and antiquated feelings that are associated in my mind with the troubled Christian religion. Further, I think it an error to portray Jesus in the “old way”, long haired and bearded. We don't know what he looked like, and I believe everyone should use their imagination to visualize him and not some crystallized imige from the past.

If these brochures by the Jesusonian Foundation, are going out by the thousands with these erroneous perceptions of Jesus, the angels, the structure of the seven superuniverses and so on, I can only sigh in exasperation at the possible harm it might do to the initial impression of _The URANTIA Book_.

Finally, I don't think you can soft soap or mollycoddle anyone to read The URANrIA Book. We can only hope to locate those thousands who are dying to read the book but don't know of its existence.

> The religion of the spirit requires only unity of experience — uniformity of destiny — making full allowance for diversity of belief. The religion of the spirit requires only uniformity of insight, not uniformity of viewpoint and outlook. ([UB 155:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_9))

## Life After Death

Life After Death is an issue of The Jesusonian magazine published for readers newly introduced to _The URANTIA Book_. It explains, “... the written summaries, universe maps, and graphic overviews presented here are designed as a book review to illustrate the seven stages of our journey from Earth to Paradise, as described in Parts I and II of _The URANTIA Book_.”

The first thing I noticed about Life After Death was the title itself. It is an eye catching subject. The cover is beautiful and the art and photography are visually appealing. I bought multiple copies right away.

I have given copies of ‘Life After Death’ to friends who have family members or friends who are facing death. In our conversation I ask if they think the family member or friend is afraid of dying. They usually say, “Yes”. Then I offer the magazine by saying, “I have a magazine that you might want to share with your mother (or whoever is facing death). Read it first and see what you think.” Their comments later are usually something like this: “Is this part of your church? It was very interesting.”

I have also left copies in hospital waiting rooms, being sure to leave the order form inside. I have had no feedback from these placements since I left no way to be contacted.

‘Life After Death’ has been very well received by the new readers I have given it to. They have enthusiastically culled it the most beautiful magazine they have ever seen. Its excellent reception by new readers indicates that it has hit the mark it was designed for very well indeed.

‘Life After Death’ is a beautiful and professionally produced magazine which can be a very useful tool as well.

## Introduction To _The Urantia Book_

If the Jesusonian Foundation were to publish nothing else, it will have won its place in the “Service Hall of Fame” by producing its “Introduction to _The URANTIA Book_”. This 12 page pamphlet is beautifully illustrated in full colour. It comes with two separate covers which should appeal to a variety of prospective readers.

But even aside from the professional quality of its artistic and technical aspects, the pamphlet is a superlative introductory presentation of the material in _The URANTIA Book_. As each of the four parts of the book is described, its content is presented in the basic spiritual context which the book itself employs: the factual information in _The URANTIA Book_ was given to illustrate God's love for us as it is displayed in his plans for us. The pamphlet continually conveys this basic spiritual context.

It is written in easily understood language and relates directly to the reader and his/her life. _The URANTIA Book_'s relationship to existing religions is excellently described. The origin of the book is dealt with succinctly and in a straight-forward manner. The section “How to Start Reading The URANIIA Book” contains suggestions which should be quite helpful to a new reader faced with a 2097 page book.

This introduction is a triumph of teamwork and a most welcome aid in sharing _The URANTIA Book_ with our fellows.

## Old coins in a shoebox

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left" alt="coin">
<img src="/image/article/606/coin.jpg">
</figure>

When I was a young lad, my brother and I used to play in the attic of $m y$ parents' house. There was a shoebox full of old coins we played shop with — “buying” and “selling” things in the attic from one another. We knew they weren't real money because they all had a picture of a tree fern on one side and a rainbow on the other, and with the coins bearing different inscriptions.

Many years later, I started reading _The URANTIA Book_, becoming increasingly inspired by its teachings. Then I remembered, for some strange reason, the coins $m y$ brother and I played with, and although not paying much attention to the words inscribed on them then, felt that the ideas in the Book, and the ideas on the coins had something in common.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right" alt="coin">
<img src="/image/article/606/coin2.jpg">
</figure>

Delving into the family archives, I came across the coins shown here. They are part of a series of over 50 different coins minted by my great grandfather, Mr. E.W. Cole between 1879 and 1915.

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left" alt="coin">
<img src="/image/article/606/coin3.jpg">
</figure>

They were designed as advertising tokens — to be used for a 3d. discount in any purchase from “Coles Book Arcade” in Bourke Street, Melbourne, which had over one million books on display, making it one of the largest in the world at that time. He believed in books with a passion, stating that “.... to observe, enquire, read and think is the first duty of man.” He never asked people to buy. He encouraged browsing. In some cases people would browse all day in the Arcade and read half a book, returning the following day to finish it. In the meantime he provided them with chairs to make sure they were comfortable in the process!

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-right" alt="coin">
<img src="/image/article/606/coin4.jpg">
</figure>

He knew the value of serving his customers, and took great pains to make sure the Arcade was comfortable, employing a permanent 5 piece string orchestra on the balcony. Conventional, he was not. He advertised, successfully, for a wife in the Melbourne ‘Herald’, producing 6 little Coles as a result, my grandmother included. Insightful, he was, particularly as to the value of knowledge and truth which was available through books.

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left" alt="coin">

“It is books,” he said, “that will relieve a man of his weary hours, enable him to pass his time pleasantly, and whilst enriching his mind with wisdom, which cannot fail to be of intrinsic value to him in every phase and condition of life here, will also serve as capital in the next stage of existence. I idolize them for their unparalleled value as an agency, helping mankind to higher destinies. They are the channel through which the influence flows that makes the difference between the wise and, well — the otherwise.”

Had _The URANTIA Book_ been available 50 years earlier, I think it would have been prominently displayed in the Arcade!

## Greetings From The Sydney Study Group

I'd just like to send greetings to the readership around Australia and beyond on behalf of the members of the Sydney study group. The more we go through life and get involved with the many tasks it presents to us, the easier it is to lose touch with the relationships of our fellow human beings who aren't in our everyday vicinities. For those of us whose lives have been changed and transformed by _The URANTIA Book_ I believe there is a strong bond which joins us together in spiritual brotherhood and fellowship. This invisible brotherhood is a very powerful thing indeed as it has the potential to transform the lives of souls it comes into contact with, giving it a geometric capacity for growth. As it grows it gains momentum. This invisible brotherhood is alive and active only to the degree that its ‘members’ are alive and active. What's the point in knowing a truth if it isn't lived? Living the truth can be done by socializing your SELF — i.e. being real and truthful and sincere within your SELF and then socializing your SELF — it's the natural, unconscious, non-egotistical way of contributing to the unfolding of the Brotherhood of Man — which taken to cosmic levels is contributing to the emergence of the Supreme Being — it's the way of evolution assisted by revelation.

Given that life gives us as many distractions as it does challenges (maybe even more) we need to be making efforts to ensure that the distractions do not take us away from the currents of Brotherhood emergence. Just as our bodies need to be nourished and replenished with wholesome food, so our spirits need replenishing with wholesome, good quality contact with our spiritual brothers and sisters. I believe through my own experience that active and regular participation in URANTIA Book study groups is one of the surest ways of replenishing the spirit. The discussions and interactions which take place as believers study the book together has such supreme value — it not only deepens the breadth and depth of your understanding of the book and the truths it contains, but it also strengthens the bonds of spiritual brotherhood and friendship with those you study with. It can become twofold — your understanding of the truth helps develop your relationship with God and the contact with fellow readers helps to develop an understanding of your fellow man which can develop into genuine acceptance and eventually love for those people. These are the kinds of experience which enhance your soul growth and maturity attainment, help you become more unified and real which helps you to become a better person and more able to touch the lives of those you come into contact with throughout your day to day activities. This is what Jesus means as ‘By their fruits you shall know them’. The very lives transformed individuals live should automatically bear fruits of the spirit if the truth is genuinely and sincerely being lived out by those individuals.

As the local study group gives you the more regular contact with other readers, the annual gatherings or less regular regional gatherings we have are a tremendous opportunity to broaden your horizons of fellowship with other readers. I find these less frequent gatherings have a highlighting effect in that you have high quality contact with people you only meet with occasionally. You tend to cram your time with as much high quality conversation as you can because you know time is limited. These experiences can leave you with a strengthened bond for those fellows you've just met with and can give a sense of participation in the more extended invisible brotherhood. As you contact fellow readers further and further afield your sense of belonging to a fellowship of planetary and worldwide brotherhood fills you with greater commitment and gives you a greater sense of belonging to something of significance to the planetary spiritual progression of our world.

So with those thoughts in mind I would like to invite and encourage anyone passing through or visiting Sydney to attend our study group which is held every second Wednesday night. There are about nine of us who meet regularly and others who attend occasionally. All have a keen interest in the book and welcome any visitors.

I would also like to extend special greetings to fellow readers in Melbourne. I am sure there is a wealth of experience in store for us all someday as we get to know each other more. I hear the readership is growing considerably down there and I look forward to an opportunity of meeting with you. I hope some of you are planning on coming to our annual meeting this year in Queensland. It'd be nice to strengthen the bonds by sharing some time together.

Sincerely with love and fellowship

Kathleen Swadling, Sydney

P.S. Please note that references made to the participation in the invisible brotherhood and the Brotherhood of Man are not to be confused with participation in the URANTIA Brotherhood. The former is spiritual, the latter social.

## What Do You Think This Means ?

> “And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and cod-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead; the Spirit of Truth is not in then; they are useless branches on the living vine, and they soon will be taken away.” ([UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2))

## Psychic Or Spiritual?

“Stabilize mind by subordination to spirit.” — I am convinced, for most of us, this is the essential prerequisite to the development of our relationship with our Paradise Father, one which allows His rule to truly rule every moment of our lives.

The religious experience is a personal experience, one which defies our mortal mind to describe. But the mortal mind is the arena through which our Adjuster must work, and in traversing the realms of our subconscious, protoplasmic memory banks, emotional background, morals, conscience, ideals, expectations and learning, the Adjuster can have a dreadfully hard task, compounded by the fact that we are often somewhat confused in the role of father, child, the emotion love, and the place Heaven.

The last mentioned _The URANTIA Book_ explains perfectly, and since most of us have a pretty strange fairy tale image of ourselves, dressed in chiffon, being handed wings, a halo and a harp and just rolling around heaven all day, for evermore and a day, which, with the only alternative to this ever after lifestyle, being, no clothes or associated paraphernalia being chucked in a big burning pit which burns us forever more and a day, we naturally opted for heaven.

And then we were blessed with a beautiful blue book and the revealing of God's creation, His plan and His purpose and it all seems so right to us, so understandable and acceptable, both as to who we are, who God is and what He plans to achieve through ourselves. Our minds accept this as logical.

The book supplies a wealth of information on our Father and ourselves as His children. We appreciate that many of the emotions we have felt in the past are natural, that we have a very basic material mind which can make communication by our Adjuster difficult. We also understand how our minds, conscious, subconscious are full of a lot of erroneous guff but know that in handing over all matters of mind to our Thought Adjuster, it will work to clear away all of this so that our ideals can be truly spiritualized.

And we are further advised that “Religious living is devoted living, and devoted living is creative living, original and spontaneous. New religious insights arise out of conflicts which initiate the choosing of new and better reaction habits in the place of older and inferior reaction patterns. New meanings only emerge amid conflict; and conflict persists only in the face of refusal to espouse the higher values connoted in superior meanings.”" ([UB 100:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_1))

> “Religious perplexities are inevitable; there can be no growth without psychic conflict and spiritual agitation. The organization of a philosophic standard of living entails considerable commotion in the philosophic realms of the mind. Loyalties are not exercised on behalf of the great, the good, the true and the noble without a struggle. Effort is attendant upon clarification of spiritual vision and enhancement of cosmic insight. And the human intellect protests against being weaned from subsisting upon the nonspiritual energies of temporal existence. The slothful animal mind rebels at the effort required to wrestle with cosmic problem solving.” 
> 
> “But the great problem of religious living consists in the task of unifying the soul powers of the personality by the dominance of love.” ([UB 100:4.2-3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_2))

> “Man cannot cause growth, but he can supply favourable conditions. Growth is always unconscious, be it physical, intellectual, or spiritual. Love thus grows; it cannot be created, manufactured or purchased; it must grow.”" ([UB 100:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p3_7))

Don't they write and express themselves so beautifully! I sit down and try to put something to paper, it takes me ten foolscap pages, and I open the blue book and there is one sentence that says the lot.

The book does not describe the psychic, but I suspect that in trying to communicate with us at a conscious level, the psychic can either be a curse or a blessing to the Thought Adjuster — as sone of our zany dreams will reveal. I personally, suspect that the psychic arena is embraced within what the revelators call “the protoplasmic memory” and if this is so would explain how people can get stuck on a reincarnation theory.

The ego will have its finishing touch to dream imagery and depending upon whether our ego be inflated — in which instance we will colour the Adjuster's image with a tinge of Messiahship about our role — or the converse, an ego which relegates self worth to zilch, which will convert the dream into one of guilt and self recrimination — one can appreciate how certain people who have had, to them, a very real religious experience, will foul up the message totally.

And so, in the education of ourselves as to our Father and ourselves as His children, and in the enlightenment of His will for us on a day to day basis, I verily believe we must each arrive at our own formula for growth — for our relationship with God is a personal one — we are each individuals, the mode of development, the growth in intensity of same will be unique. The book points in the direction of various pitfalls to watch for, in regard to emanations from within, as being at very best coming from our alter ego rather than our Adjuster. So where do we go when we are advised to question our minds, which is the arena for interaction between our Adjusters and ourselves? My conclusion — love and faith and more and more love and faith and prayer and worship.

Introspection is a good technique. But this means examination of one's thoughts and not in a self-judgmental manner.

For a good number of us love had a price. — “Do that and I will love youl” and we have had a lot of right/wrongs locked within us good/bad etc. and before our Adjuster can truly spiritualise our thinking we must clear our systems of all these erroneous beliefs.

A rather sobering thought helps me in my personal endeavours — ay Adjuster has to go through every base erroneous thought that 1ullow to flit through my mind. My Adjuster has worked so hard during my lifetime, it is about time I started to pull m weight — weed the garden of my mind so beauty, truth and goodness can be sown, nurtured by love and a spiritual viewpoint.

## You Can Never Watch Yourself Grow

I'd like to share some thoughts with you all sparked off by the excellent and sincere article by Ann Bendall in Six-0-Six May/June '89 issue named ‘Why Aren't They Knocking on My Door?’

I found I could relate to Anne's feelings as there are sections in _The URANTIA Book_ that suggest that certain situations can be taken as y yardstick for one's degree of development. The quote Anne referred to on [UB 155:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_4) is a classic example. Jesus was almost reprimanding the twenty-four for being too chronic in their yearning, too vacillating and indefinite in their teaching conduct. This then left them vulnerable for ridicule by the heathen as flaws could be found easily in their teaching. Jesus said: “If you desire to enter the kingdom, why do you not take it by spiritual assault even as the heathen take a city they lay siege to?” ([UB 155:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_3)) Then he goes on to state the part that prompted Anne: “Let me emphatically state this eternal truth: If you, by truth co-ordination, learn to exemplify in your lives this beautiful wholeness of righteousness, your fellow men will then seek after you that they may gain what you have so acquired. The measure wherewith truth seekers are drawn to you represents the measure of your truth endowment, your righteousness. The extent to which you have to go with your message to the people is, in a way, the measure of your failure to live the whole or righteous life, the truth-co-ordinated life.” ([UB 155:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_5))

This kind of passage, and I know there are many others, but I cannot find them unfortunately, do have the effect of making you look to yourself to see how you rate and when you see that you don't rate as high as you think you should you start to feel that you're doing something wrong, but you don't know what. You know you're sincere, you love God, you strive to do his will, to be like him — what else do I have to do one might ask — why am I not bearing the fruits of the spirit? I know these feelings well.

One thing I've came to realize as a result of this kind of dilemma is that you can never watch yourself grow. You can Jook back and see how far you've come but you can't see yourself growing. Jesus said “Don't let your right hand know what the left hand is doing”. Over the years this saying has come to mean more and more to me as I feel I must just get on and live as best as I know how, learn by my mistakes, remain sincere, keep on seeking the Father's will and let my soul get on with growing at its own pace without my present consciousness being too concerned about how well it's Joing.

I think faith plays a big part. We may think our efforts aren't bearing fruits but remember the parable of the mustard seed. How small and insignificant some of our actions, deeds and words may be now — in fact so small and insignificant they may go by without you even being conscious of what you may have done. However if we are living up to the highest within us, as best as we can, these actions, words or deeds may be falling on fertile soil and may not bear fruit for years — even decades. you may be long gone, but our faith keeps us going knowing that someday, somewhere, somehow fruits will be born as a result of your desire to LIVE the truth.

I think Jesus' basic message in this passage is to LIV: TRUIH rather than trying to ram it down peoples' throat.

I guess what I'm trying to say is that there's nothing to worry about if there is a sincere desire to know God. Give it time — all good things take time to mature and ripen.

Thanks for those thoughts, Anne and it is comforting to know that others have similar experiences und dilemmas to tackle in life.

## Dear Six-0-Six

Thank you very much for the Newsletters. You have the advantage there in Australia because you are an English-speaking nation. So you don't have to' bother yourself with translations of materials. Here we are having a whole special branch of organization for translating the materials into our native language, Estonian. _The URANTIA Book_ has also been translated already.

You see, in a way, translating o book is quite a pleasant activity, because you have to understand everything you are translating. This is one of the best ways to acquaint yourself deeply und thoroughly with printed material.

For us your region is quite exotic. We have never been there but we have read about Australia and the South Sea Islands and we have seen many films about this region on Finnish T.V. There are also quite a number of Estonians in Australia. Just now one of then is on a brief visit here. She came to see her son. So the world is not so very big.

I keep sending you postcards of Estonia if you don't mind. And I an very grateful for the postcards you sent to me. It is better to see once than hear twice.

We like your Newsletter very much. It has such a broadminded attitude. Maybe we could also send something to be printed in it someday.

Our group is but a small fraction of a bigger movement, built mainly on a spiritual basis. There are different trends of thought in it and many sub-groups, dealing with different problems. The word Independent is the name of our group and means simply that we are not taking part in any political movement of which there are many in Estonia just now. For most of the religious groups and movements are also connected with different political groupings.

Hope to hear from you soon.

## Urantian Influence And Parenthood

### How We Fond The Book

Dianne, my wife, had been fascinated with the concepts and reportings surrounding death. As such she was intuitively searching for a better explanation. This search had resulted in the study of Astrology in which she reflected the comparisons or patterns of human behaviour between the study and he personal experience. In the course of her many sojourns to th Malvern Library she picked a variety of books relating to Astrology and Astronomy, one of which was (mistakenly) _The URANTIA Book_.

On reflection, Di said the book nearly fell into her hands as she was searching. She only read the first couple of headings ... “Central & Superuniverses”, “The Local Universe” ... which was of interest. Had she read further “The Life and Teachings of Jesus”, the book would have been on the shelf before you could wink. Both of us were so put off religion by the double standards and ritualistic “mumbo jumbo” we had been exposed to, that we had built up mental “barriers”. An equally dogmatic intolerance as destructive as the dogma we were protesting about.

### The Search (Thirst) For Knowledge, Experience, Wisdom, Truth:

While Di was gaining knowledge about human behaviour through books and Astrology. I was looking at personal development through the study of business cassette tapes, seminars etc. We had both started to look for better answers to personal growth and greater human understanding. We both had started to rapidly change our perspective on life, becoming receptive to expansive life changing concepts that intuitively felt right.

The discovery of the “Book” became an instant fascination and inspiration to explore new ideas, concepts and knowledge by other great thinkers in religion, philosophy, psychology, and business. I was interstate on business when Di originally discovered the book, she spend the next 16 hours reading; she could not put it down.

While we both are active readers of the “book”, we have come to realise the old adage “the more you know, the more you know you don't know”.

### Gaining A Cosmic Perspective With Implications To Personal Development:

From a purely personal positive point of view, one of the great insights “_The URANTIA Book_” has given me is a cosmic perspective of where we have come from and where we are headed, plus how important each of us are in the total scheme of things. With this insight, I have found the dissemination of information and focus on how I behave to situations clearer, personal change easier. With changes to attitudes, I have experienced changes in my personality, which in turn has “opened the focus” to experience even more life changes. A mushroom effect!

I think it's a bit like ... the more you experience changes that add to your wisdom, the greater your visions of the future become.

### The World's Population Has Increased By One:

As a result of both of us becoming more loving human beings we decided to have another child. Getting a better perspective on life and a feeling that one of the major contributions we can give and receive in our community is to add a well loved, balanced child into its midst. Naturally, our primary feelings centred around our family desires to share and receive more love.

Quite a lot of planning, personal difficulty, and ... baby Alexandra Elizabeth, number 3 child arrived.

Our desire is to have her enter a loving family, in a positive environment, in which all of us learn from cumulative knowledge & experiences in our search for wisdom and truth. In short, striving to know God and be like him.

## Mother Teresa Talks About Prayer

At the Oxford Conference of Spiritual and Parliamentary Leaders on Human Survival Mother Teresa, when asked why she thought prayer and meditation were important in the work of solving the problems of humanity, replied: “If we are to solve the problems we must learn to love one another as God loves each one of us. That is why it's necessary to bring prayer into our lives. Prayer is the gift of a clean heart, and a clean heart can see God. If you see God in each other then you can love each other as God loves each one of us. It doesn't matter what religion we belong to, we can all share in prayer because we have all been created by the same loving hand of God, loved to be loved.”
