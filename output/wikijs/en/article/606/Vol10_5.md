## “Thought For The Month”

> “The Father desires all his creatures to be in personal communion with him. He has on Paradise a place to receive all those whose survival status and spiritual nature make possible such attainment. Therefore settle in your philosophy now and forever: To each of you and to all of us, God is approachable, the Father is attainable, the way is open; the forces of divine love and the ways and means of divine administration are all interlocked in an effort to facilitate the advancement of every worthy intelligence of every universe to the Paradise presence of the Universal Father.” _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 63:6.par](/en/The_Urantia_Book/63#p6_par)

## Dear Six-0-Six

Long have we entertained thoughts of Australia and its verdant beauty, but more so the thought of making some kind of a connection with someone in this land down under. And now to our immense pleasure we find our Father's sons and daughters, our brothers and sisters living on this great continent of fascinating evolution. What more can we ask then to have someone, any one or all of you get back in touch with us.

My husband and I are not longtime readers of the Urantia revelation, yet know we are always progressing gradually, as did our brother Michael during his sojourn in the flesh, fulfilling his last bestowal.

We sit out on our lanai during the early morning hours in the dark (not wanting to wake our children) before he goes to work, sharing and talking about the things that have been revealed to us. And then when the sun does come up over the tall pines, and gives us light, we read and read, and share again with each other the things that cause the reality response in us to adjust and adjust our thinking, time and time again.

‘Magnificent’ is the word that escapes my lips, and yet even that word seems far to paltry for proper description.

I have spent the better part of the day, reading the articles from your magazine 6-0-6, and they brought pleasure to me, as I enjoyed them so very much. Some of them date back to 1986. Especially did I enjoy reading the article by Robert Crickett, Melbourne. The title was ‘On The Practice of Doing The Will of God’, Sept/Oct 1988. I knew, that he knew the meaning of doing the will of God, finding him and wanting to be like him, so simple, and yet so fully packed with things that will take billions of years to learn.

Just to personally connect, each individual, and sincerely follow the way back to our Father, how better to reveal our Father, than to live the pursuit in our personal life.

I also enjoyed the article by Ann Bendall, Nambour, QLD. May/June 1989. “Why aren't they knocking on my door?”

My husband and I both belonged to a religion that taught God was higher in thought than us, yet they consistently “humanized” Him, giving Him attributes of vengeance, wrath, and even the pitiful human emotion we refer to as love (this word being the best we can utilize at this time). I still “picturize'”' my Father as an absolute source of light, yet I too am conscious of sometime humanizing Him. It is at these times I recall the beginning of my evolution from the time of life implantation, and stand still and reflect on what I have become today, a creature that literally crawled out of the primordial sludge and now I am here, conscious of being indwelt by a fragment of the one that caused my life to evolve and evolve. Again the word 'magnificent' slips into my mind. And the word 'mercy', mercy that surpasses all known human thought. And then I think, no, I know I'm not doing so bad after all.

I love you Ann, and I'm knocking on your door. I truly desire to share with you, your experiences, and your knowledge.

As you know we will be celebrating the day of the birth of Jesus this weekend, and I have the fun of making the cake. I am also making a flag, with Michael's emblem on it, to hang at our meeting place. Let me tell you it gives a whole new meaning to “sewing circle”. I am hoping it is at the very least uniform in its circles, and not lopsided.

My husband, Lee, is going to give a talk on what Jesus did not say or do, when being questioned by Herod and Pilate.

The place where we will be going is called Herrli Retreat. Jim Herrli, the owner had an interesting experience concerning the reason he built this retreat. And he is a healer. I just met him last week, for the first time. I am interested in his ability to heal, because I have often wondered about this gift, and I am curious to understand it. Due to my previous religious upbringing, I could have been what you call a sceptic, but now I would consider myself an open minded, tinted with a bit of scepticism, curious person. I fully agree with the statement in one of your articles, to believe everything is to believe nothing. Yet, I know that the healings performed by Jesus all dealt with time, so, like I said, I am looking forward to Mr. Herrli.

Well, my dear brothers and sisters, here's hoping we hear from you soon.

Lee and Connie Lester, Englewood, FL. USA

## Perth Gathering

On the weekend of August 19th and 20th a gathering of students of _The URANTIA Book_ was held at Pinjarra, South of Perth.

Organised by Peter and Sue Webb of Yanchep, 9 readers from Perth, Bunbury and Busselton enjoyed an intense weekend of study and discussion.

A full account of this event will appear in the Nov/Dec issue of 6-0-6.

## Greetings From Quebec

Dear Friends,

We are a group of 15 readers, here in Québec, who have joined their efforts in order to initiate various actions related to our belief in _The URANTIA Book_.

Although our Action Group is only 18 months old, we have had a long history of readership in Quebec. For several years, we have published a monthly newsletter and now that our group is more structured, we would like to receive your newsletter on a regular basis. We will be happy to send you ours every month, although it is in French.

## Boots And All Experience

I took to the Book like a duck to water. Boy, what an amazing amount of information it had! The insights ... the inspirations ... the truth... and all conveyed in such loving and powerful language! My first reaction was to learn it all, lock myself away and become fully conversant with its fascinating factual content.

But then the Book said that further along the universe career, we will gain far greater cosmic wisdom and insight than we possibly can now. “ ... It is exceedingly difficult to present enlarged concepts and advanced truth .... when we are restricted to the use of a circumscribed language of the realm”. ([UB 0:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_2))

It seemed to me that while it supplies intriguing information about the purpose, structure, nature and scope of the universe of universes, God etc., it also gives us guideline instructions on how we can best utilise our short time on earth.

What key instructions does the Book give to help me become, in due course, an ascender of maximum universe value? The criterion I came up with was to imagine a request somewhere along the universe career where volunteers are called for an assignment. I put my hand up and say “I would like to volunteer. I believe I would be suitable because I experienced (certain things) when on Urantia which equip me for this assignment.”

What are these “certain things”? I believe that it is essentially quality of experience. Actual experience is one of the most sought after and valuable universe commodities. Perfected beings crave it. “Actual living experience has no cosmic substitute”. ([UB 109:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p1_3)) and “It is not so much what you learn in this first life; it is the experience of living this life that is important. Even the work of this world, paramount though it is, is not nearly so important as the way in which you do this work.” ([UB 39:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_13))

How do we gain these experiences? Wait for them to be delivered to us? I don't think so. Andon and Fonta, for example, we are told had to set the pace. “And so, by reason of their own intelligent choice, the twins did migrate, and because of our supervision they migrated northward...” ([UB 62:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p5_9)) Likewise, I believe we have to set the pace, which gives our superhuman guides, the Thought Adjusters and angelic guardians, the opportunity to nudge us in the right direction.

“Jesus well knew that God can be known only by the realities of experience; never can he be understood by the mere teaching of the mind.” (1856:2) My approach to life now is to jump in, boots and all, and learn — not blindly — but with intelligence, nativity and faith in the ultimate spiritual worth that these experiences will reveal to contain. “The teachings of Jesus constitute a religion of valor, courage and heroism.” ([UB 140:8.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_20))

“The act is ours; the consequences God's.” ([UB 48:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_13)) What a terrific arrangement! We get all the fun and excitement of the experiences and someone else bears the consequences! Let's not waste any time! For each of us, in our own ways, the opportunities are there today. I suggest we all actively go out and get all the experience we can!

**STILL MORE ABOUT SURVIVAL**

The articles by Trevor Swadling (6-0-6, vol 10, no 1), and by Helen Hutchinson (F.S.F.S, vol 8, no 5) provided interesting discussion of the proportion of Urantia mortals that survive to fuse with their Thought Adjusters. Helen mentioned the comment in _The URANTIA Book_ about a Thought Adjuster that had already indwelt 15 mortals who had refused to survive. The quote comes from [UB 109:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p4_5), and states, “I have observed a Thought Adjuster indwelling a mind on Urantia who has, according to the records on Uversa, indwelt fifteen minds previously in Orvonton. We do not know whether this Monitor has had similar experiences in other superuniverses, but I suspect so. This is a marvelous Adjuster and one of the most useful and potent forces on Urantia during this present age.”

Although we cannot be certain, the text indicates that such an Adjuster is somewhat unusual. Making this assumption we can obtain statistical estimates about possible survival rates. Allowing that we are referring to the world population of the 1930's, if the survival rate for Urantia mortals was about 50%, then probability theory tells us that there would have been in excess of 50,000 Thought Adjusters on Urantia at that time that had previously indwelt 15 non-surviving mortals. For the 2.2 percent survival rate mentioned by Trevor, there would have been in excess of one billion Thought Adjusters with the necessary qualifications. For a survival rate of about 75%, there is a high probability that there would have been at least one such Thought Adjuster. Perhaps this figure may be a reasonable expectation for a planet such as ours that has benefited from the sojourn of a Paradise bestowal Son and on which practically all Adjusters belong to the advanced or supreme type ([UB 109:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p3_6)). If the indwelling of 15 non-surviving mortals is an extremely rare occurrence, the estimated survival rate could be much higher. I have no doubt that the Father-God made known to us in _The URANTIA Book_ would be dissatisfied with anything less than 100%.

## Science And _The Urantia Book_

The scientific and historical content of _The URANTIA Book_ includes much material that was unknown to us mortals at the time of its publication. An editorial panel is now operating that will attempt to collect and publish such material.

Articles are being invited that comment on scientific or historical information to be found in the Book that was of a prophetic nature at the time of receipt of The URANTIA Papers and that has since come into line with current opinion. Comment is also invited on topics that are still at variance with current scientific or historical evidence, as well as views on the interpretation of the mandate given to the revelators as outlined in Paper 101, section 4. Authors should include literature references to their information sources.

The present editorial panel consists of Dick Bain and Matt Neibaur in the U.S.A., and Ken Glasziou in Australia. It is hoped that a European representative can be added. Pacific area contributors may send their items to Ken, either care of 6-0-6, or directly to Stanley River Road, Maleny, QLD. 4552, Australia.

## The Two Evangelists (A Fable)

In my travels I've seen some unusual things. Recently I was visiting my uncle Reginald in a small town on the southern Queensland coast. He told me a tale about a pair of 1ocal evangelists — a monkey with a cockatoo on its shoulder. Well, need I tell you that my curiosity was aroused and my love of the ridiculous mildly stimulated? Perhaps I need not ... no.

So off I went to the place that he said they could be found, and guess what, I found them! Sitting myself down, I watched incredulously as the monkey scampered up to passersby with a large white book in its hand while the cockatoo called out, Rrrrkk, fifth epochal revelation, Rrrrkk, fifth epochal revelation."

Some people would cock their heads to one side, and occasionally someone would stop, stoop down, and politely ask the monkey to let them have a look. The monkey unerringly did so with immediate response and would give each a pamphlet as they departed, which he drew from a green, canvas shoulder bag.

After watching these two in action for about half an hour, I confessed my astonishment. I then arose from my bench seat, stretched my body, and toddled off, back to my uncle's, whereupon we had much fun sharing this most recent bemusement, and other yarns as well.

## One Vast Family

All humankind are one vast family 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this world our home
We sleep beneath one roof 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the starry sky
We warm ourselves before one hearth 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the blazing sun
Upon one floor of soil we stand 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and breathe one air
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and drink one water 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and walk the night
beneath one luminescent moon
The children of one God we are 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and brothers of one blood
and members on one worldwide 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family of God.

## They're Not Knocking On My Door Either

Some thoughts on Anne Bendall's article, 6-0-6 Newsletter May/June 1989.

No. I don't have them knocking on my door, either. No-one ever says to me “How do you do it?”, “Where do you get it from?” or “Where do you find the answers?” Not even any member of my family ever asks, or gives any recognition or questioning thought.

But through all the sometimes emotional and trying situations in life, I know how I do it and where my strength comes from.

As Jesus passed by, he always offered words of care and comfort, eased embarrassment and scattered love to everyone with whom he came in contact. Because of this scattering and outpouring of love and goodness, there was a response from those who received it. That response varied from a tentative and discreet touch of his garment by a shy,trusting little lady, to the noise and mobbing by throngs of crowding and excited people.

Recipients react in different ways to that which is given to them.

We readers of _The URANTIA Book_ have different reactions to the unfolding of the words of the gift of the revelation which we have received. Do we become emotional crusaders, or do we re-adjust our own lives on a quiet, personal basis? We are told that the zeal of the crusader can be dangerous, but the realisation of the love within us cannot help but overflow to others. In our own small way, whatever we are capable of, we can share our gift with others. ‘The act is ours; the consequences, God's’. ([UB 48:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_13))

Some years ago, I admired and was envious of, the strength of the faith of a friend. I knew that this friend had “'something” which I did not. But I did not knock on that door, either. That friend showed me the way to knock on God's door, and I knocked on His instead. My needs were there — and they were met.

Now I know where to obtain the answers to life's problems, and also that I have the assurance and peace which passes all understanding.

It does not matter to me that people do not come knocking on my door yet. I am a less than average achiever in life, you could call me very average. I am like the little trusting lady who reached out for the hem of Jesus' garment. Not an overly confident or extrovert person, but one who is infinitely trusting of the results of this tentative action.

I reached out and I found.

Maybe the only thing “wrong” with people like you and me, Anne, is that we are mere Urantian mortals with many, many handicaps. But that in itself can be a challenge!

We are still growing, we are still seeking, and we are still learning. And while ever this progress continues, we can be certain that “Even if I cannot do this, there lives in me one who can and will do it.” ([UB 4:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_9)), and that we are ascending upwards and ever inwards, however slowly.

So as we pass by in our work and play, by the showing of our simple, every-day concern and love towards our brothers, we hope and pray that they may, in time, see that we have “something” that is missing in their own lives. When they realise the need, we can show them the way to go knocking on our Father's door. “Knock and it shall be opened to you, seek and you shall find”.

Janet Weeks, Banora Point (Tweed Heads) NSW

## Inner Peace

Be on the lookout for symptoms of inner peace. The hearts of a great many have already been exposed and it is possible that people everywhere could come down with it in epidemic proportions. This could pose a serious threat to what has up to now, been a fairly stable condition of conflict and violence in our world.

Here are some signs and symptoms of inner peace:

* A tendency to act and think spontaneously rather than on fears based on past experiences.
* An unmistakable ability to enjoy each moment.
* A loss of interest in judging other people.
* A loss of interest in judging self.
* A loss of interest in interpreting the actions of others.
* A loss of ability to worry. (This is a very serious symptom.)
* Frequent, overwhelming episodes of appreciation.
* Contented feelings of connectedness with others and nature.
* Frequent attacks of smiling.
* An increased susceptibility to the love extended by others as well as the uncontrollable urge to extend it.

Thank you to the person who contributed this. I can't remember who it was.

## Mediterranean Basin

In 1970 the Glomar Challenger sailed for the Mediterranean Sea. Two scientists, Bill Ryan and Ken Shoo, were looking for evidence of the early history of the Mediterranean. At a site 100 miles east of the Straight of Gibraltar they drilled for a core sample.

15 million years ago the Straight of Gibraltar closed. Around Urantia it was a time of mountain building and volcanic activity. The Mediterranean was connected to the Atlantic Ocean for a while by a channel across France so that the mountain peaks of that region stood above the water as islands in a sea. Later the Mediterranean connected with the Indian Ocean, but by 10 million years ago when the Suez was elevated, the Mediterranean was cut off from the oceans of the world and became for a time an inland salt sea. ([UB 61:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_8))

As the scientists attempted to obtain a sample of the sea floor their drill bit became stuck. Upon retrieval they discovered the last section of their pipe filled with a strange type of gravel composed of only four components: volcanic bedrock, limestone, gypsum, and tiny fossils. Their find amazed the team.

Ten million years ago the Mediterranean Sea covered much of northern Africa. ([UB 61:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p4_2)) For a short time all the land was again joined except for Australia. Five million years ago the land connection between Africa and South America submerged and the Western Hemisphere became isolated much as it is today. This time is usually called the Pliocene.

The scientists obtained one thousand feet of core sample. The rock record revealed a time of rising alpine mountains and continental collisions. Other sites around the Mediterranean were sampled. Each time they found the bedrock covered with limestone, then gypsum containing shells of very small sea creatures.

In their search for an answer to what this meant the scientists examined gravel in other places of the world. For example, they found gravels in Death Valley, California, to be composed of a great variety of components, and they concluded these were washed down from surrounding areas. Gravels do not form at the bottom of a sea, however, and the Mediterranean gravels were different. They had never been washed down. They had occurred in place. The tiny animals were adults that had survived in an extreme environment, a stressed community. The gypsum could have only formed through evaporation. The limestone could have formed from dried up oozes. The scientists had found evidence of an evaporative tidal flat with volcanic activity nearby. They found a record of a cataclysmic event near the Straight of Gibraltar.

On [UB 64:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p4_10) we are told that the Mediterranean Sea was extended in the Black Sea area about 550,000 years ago. Then one- half million years ago the Mediterranean Sea retreated consequent upon the elevation of Arabia and the Sangik peoples of this time were able to reach Africa. ([UB 64:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_1)) The superior Sangiks migrated to northern more temperate climes, but the orange, green, and indigo races gravitated to Africa over this newly elevated land bridge separating the westward retreating Mediterranean from the Indian Ocean. ([UB 64:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p7_1))

The scientists found that the rivers and rains that flow and fall into the Mediterranean Sea do not bring in enough water to match the evaporation from the hot sun. Their core samples showed areas of soils on the slopes, tidal flats along the margins, and in the middle Mediterranean, the last drill site in the centre of the abysmal plain, the deepest part of the sea, they hit rock salt! They concluded that the very middle of the Mediterranean was at one time completely dry. Moreover, they found over 1000 feet of salt deposits in places. Since it takes the evaporation of about 50 feet of salt water to form one foot of solid salt, they knew that even if the entire Mediterranean dried up there would not be enough water for the amount of salt they had found.

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us on page 890 that about 34,000 years ago the isthmus of Gibraltar, protecting the western Mediterranean, broke during an earthquake, quickly raising this inland lake to the level of the Atlantic Ocean. Then the Sicilian land bridge submerged, and the Mediterranean became one sea connected to the Atlantic Ocean. This great cataclysm caused the highest loss of life by flood in all of the world's history.

To account for their theory that the Mediterranean had once been an inland sea, the scientists speculated on how the Mediterranean had been closed. They concluded that the Straight of Gibraltar had opened and closed throughout history. At once cutting off the Mediterranean from its western source and then suddenly, cataclysmally, breaking and exposing the relatively dry basin to the onrush of the open Atlantic cascading over a falls perhaps a kilometer in height. The onslaught of water was so forceful it broke the sound barrier as it fell and washed away three million years of the rock record.

Less than 34,000 years ago, in connection with the violent activity of the surrounding volcanoes and the submergence of the Sicilian land bridge to Africa, the eastern floor of the Mediterranean slowly sank, carrying down beneath the waters the entire peninsula of the first Garden of Eden. At the same time the coast of the eastern Mediterranean was greatly elevated. ([UB 73:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p7_1)) Then on [UB 80:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/80#p1_4) we are told that during the early days of the violet race the Mediterranean trough was protected by the Gibraltar isthmus and the Sicilian land bridge, and early maritime commerce was established on these inland lakes. The Nile delta was slowly rising along with the upthrust of the Saharan area and the shifting of the water-laden winds from the west to the north turned these once great pasture areas into barren desert.

There was additional evidence to support the scientists' theories. When the Aswan Dam was being built in the late 1960's, a Soviet geologist named Chumakov was working on the foundations. He found a deep notch right through the Nubian granite of the Nile valley. Although he did not understand the mechanism at the time, he concluded that the Nile had at one time formed a great waterfall in the area. He deduced that the only way this could have happened was if the sea level of the Mediterranean had dropped hundreds of meters. After communicating with Ryan and Shoo, they came to an understanding of the dynamics of the Mediterranean: strategic areas of land had risen and sank and the water had advanced and retreated over geologic time. It was the only way to explain their findings. They published their papers together.

_The URANTIA Book_ details millions of years of geologic history for us in the section on the history of Urantia. Included in this detail is a record of the Mediterranean basin before and after it was inhabited by man. We are instructed of its connection to the open oceans and of its periodic isolation. We know the land was elevated then subsequently submerged and deluged as the water receded and then returned. It is a wonderful history, full of long eventless periods punctuated by cataclysmic occurrences and highlighted by gradual changes. This history is important to us and this importance is only now being understood.

Twenty years after their original findings Bill Ryan and Ken Shoo are completely convinced that the Mediterranean has not always been as it is today. Although there are still many sceptics, they know this region has shown historic periods of deep open sea, inland salt lakes, shallow tidal basins, and barren salt and sand deserts. They understand that the sea level has risen and fallen along with corresponding parts of the continents and land bridges. They believe these geologic changes have happened many times over the past and that they might even happen again.

What these scientists do not yet know is that they have unwittingly helped to confirm a documented history of this region that was written even before the tools to complete their deep sea survey had been developed. And although we do not need their findings, their theories, and their speculation: to maintain our belief of the fifth epochal revelation, it is work by people such as these that increases our understanding and our awe of the great knowledge and wisdom of the presenters of _The URANTIA Book_.

ANOTHER CREATION FROM OUR CROSSWORD WIZZARD AUDREY MORRIS

---

There are many also in the United Nations for whom the cooperation of all nations towards common goals and values is a kind of new religion, a supreme path or way. They see in the UN the same perennial human dream which has obsessed all great religions and philosophies, namely, the establishment of a peaceful, just, happy, harmonious world society. But there is one difference: while in the past all religions and philosophies were born within specific local, cultural contexts, today we are witnessing the birth of a new philosophy, ideology or ethics which originates from a central place of synthesis where all dreams, aspirations, claims and values of humankind converge. This is new. It constitutes one of the greatest and most exciting attempts at total human fulfillment in the entire evolution of the human race. There has never been anything like it. It is a magnificent story, the beginning of a profound world-wide transformation and transcendence of the human society, a new paradigm of the coming age.
