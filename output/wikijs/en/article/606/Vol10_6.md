## A Note From Your Editor

With this last issue for 1989 I'd like to say a warm and heartfelt 'thank you' for all your continued support. I do treasure your encouraging little notes of appreciation. At the last conference I announced that I will hand back the editorship of 6-0-6 to Neil Francey in the middle of next year. Neil, who after the welcome break from this responsibility, is all geared up and ready to go with, undoubtedly, some fresh ideas for our beloved newsletter. He will receive some assistance from Ken Glasziou in putting it all together.

The address of 6-0-6 will remain the same as I will continue to look after the mailing and subscriptions.

I want to wish you all a safe and joyous holiday season and look forward to hearing from you again in the nineties, when we will celebrate our 10th anniversary!

Madeline Noordzy

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “It should not be the aim of kingdom believers literally to imitate the outward life of Jesus in the flesh but rather to share his faith; to trust God as he trusted God and to believe in men as he believed in men. Jesus never argued about either the fatherhood of God or the brotherhood of men; he was a living illustration of the one and a profound demonstration of the other.” _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 196:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_5)

## Readers' Get-Together in the West

As some readers would know we held a get-together over here in W.A. on the weekend of the 19th — 20th August. The venue was Fairbridge Village, a one hour drive south of Perth.

All told 11 people attended, 5 arriving on the Friday evening, the rest intermittently on the Saturday.

Will, Pete and myself arrived a little late and were greeted by Margaret and Pam, frantically trying to get the fire started. Will, being the old bushie that he is, sorted that out. With fire blazing and no time to waste it was straight into a study group session. The Paper on Personality Survival was chosen, which led to some interesting conversation as Pam and Margaret were devout reincarnationists. We continued on that theme the next day.

Saturday morning after breakfast Phil Allen arrived. Phil is a long-time reader of _The URANTIA Book_ and a one time member of Peter Toy's study group in Perth. Next to arrive was John Mander, also a believer in reincarnation. It was reincarnation versus incarnation with more reading on Personality Survival. This took us to lunch, after which a video entitled “The Great Adventure” (produced by the Oklahoma U.B. Society) was shown. Next Phil gave a talk on his ideas concerning _The URANTIA Book_ and its important role in the 20th century. Unfortunately Phil left soon after to rejoin his family in Perth. John also departed soon after.

Last, but by no means 1east, Rick and Sandie Bruce and their children arrived from Busselton. They have both been students of _The URANTIA Book_ for some years. Pete and I briefly met Rick for the first time earlier in the year. It was good to catch up with Rick and to meet Sandie.

More video displays after tea. Then Pete suggested for the next morning we'd all choose a paper we were interested in and give a 10 minute talk.

The next morning Pete began with the Paper on the dinosaur era. Next I read on the Reality of Religious Experience, Sandie chose a passage on Jesus and a discussion with the disciples. Pam read on the importance of woman's role in the Jesus' papers. Will on the importance of socializing religion and Rick on evolution.

We finished off the morning in the village church, accompanied by three Christians. The service was conducted by ourselves with Rev. Will starting off with a reading from the book of Corinthians. Pete read Psalm 23, and our Christian friends contributed with a short story. Pan, being a onetime member of a church choir,led us in song and tried valiantly to keep us in tune as we sang a few hymns. We concluded the service with The Lord's Prayer.

After lunch it was time to clean up and load the car. We then listened to Will giving us a brief explanation on the function of the URANTIA Foundation and Brotherhood.

Reluctant farewells were bid with a promise to meet again in a few months. Everyone agreed that the weekend was a great success.

## Towards Specialization

There seems to be a propensity in the latter half of the 20th century towards specialization — of seeing reality in our own particular sphere of endeavour. Each decade has its catch phrase. The eighties seems to be one of economical and material considerations, generally speaking of course.

The anarchy and personal experience of the sixties led a lot of us into the lull of the seventies. The plight of the nineties and into the next century may well hinge on the economic security and the freedom to act.

The scientific and technological age is no respector of persons. Each of the five epochal revelations has heralded an event of world significance. Our present age and the Urantia revelation are indeed of monumental importance. It will only be in retrospect that its full impact will be realised.

One aspect of specialization is a narrower focusing of our energies, until other elements of our existence become channeled into a very narrow band of thinking. Indeed we do focus our minds on God. But what specialization could be more noble? Our feet are on the ground. As well as the spirit of God, we have been given the facts — science and the beauty of true emotions, and all in one dose — truth, beauty and goodness. If we are dogmatic it is not through narrow-mindedness; it is through expansions of existence.

> “If the personal experience of a faither is to be challenged by dogma, then this faith-born son of the experiencible Father may reply with that unchallengeable dogma, the statement of his actual sonship with the Universal Father.” ([UB 102:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p7_7))

We don't have gurus or churches, but we can compete with the best. What greater teacher can we have than God himself in the indwelling Adjuster.

The frustrations of not seeing the URANTIA family grow in leaps and bounds is offset by the quality of its participants. Each person saved is a living treasure. The idea of person to person contact and study groups suggests continual strong growth. The things of the world look after themselves evolution. The things of the spirit show us the meanings.

Our weekend retreat once again showed to me the quality of God-knowing and God-growing personalities on our little planet on the rim of the universe.

Science will cherish and nurture life for its own means. God will cherish and nurture our spirit if we let him.

> “We had rather assume the risk of a system rebellion than to court the hazard of depriving one struggling mortal from any evolutionary world of the eternal joy of pursuing the ascending career.” ([UB 112:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_8))

There was with all of us a quality of personalities on the weekend which was unique, just as all conferences, retreats and study groups are unique. Another aspect of God is shown to us which ever draws inwards to his source and centre.

Jesus was unique, not eccentric. In our small ways we too can share with the uniqueness which is present in God-knowing individuals. A quality which gives immense pleasure to be able to share.

## Report On Noosa 189

The timing, weatherwise, was perfect — although the local community were hoping for well-overdue rain — but for us, attendees of the conference, the Sunshine Coast turned on its namesake.

The venue, Halse Lodge, a beautiful old heritage-protected Queenslander, is set only a few minutes walk from the beach, pub, shops and rainforest walks. The atmosphere was relaxed and homely. We were blessed with the Conference Room at Halse Lodge being available for our sole usage for the duration of our stay. The adjoining kitchen area enabled us to have beverages as we desired, which increased the homely effect.

Despite interstate travelling problems associated with the Air Strike, we had 31 attendees who started arriving from 12 o'clock onwards on Thursday 5th October.

The conference officially convened at 4 pm on Thursday with Ken Glasziou giving a talk on the Paris International Meeting which he and his wife Betty attended in August, 1989.

This was followed by an introduction to Friday's workshop by Neil Francey, explaining the format, and our aspirations in respect of outcomes from the groups' endeavours.

Dinner at Halse Lodge was at 7 pm with entertainment thereafter by way of videos on _The URANTIA Book_, followed by socializing . We were very pleased to have Richard Keeler, one of the Trustees of the URANTIA Foundation, attend, who naturally was bombarded with questions about the American scene.

On Friday morning, after a hymn-sing-along, we divided into five groups for the “Missing Link” workshop which was based on the following quotation -

> “Let me emphatically state this eternal truth: If you, by truth co-ordination, learn to exemplify in your lives this beautiful wholeness of righteousness, your fellow men will then seek after you that they may gain what you have so acquired. The measure wherewith truth seekers are drawn to you represents the measure of your truth endowment, your righteousness. The extent to which you have to go with your message to the people is, in a way, the measure of your failure to live the whole or righteous life, the truth-co-ordinated life.” (Jesus, [UB 155:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_5))

The following is a synopsis of the aims of the workshop prepared by Ken Glasziou.

'The theme of the ‘Missing Link’ workshop centres around the statement from page 1726 of _The URANTIA Book_ telling us that if we absorb the message revealed by the life of Jesus and reflect that message fully in our lives, then truth seekers will be drawn to us. The next part of the statement seems to be telling us that if we find it necessary to public1y announce the message in order to find new readers, then we can be certain that we have yet to attain that stage of spiritual growth when we start to be personal advertisements for the way of Jesus.

Many URANTIA Book readers at times express the opinion that we do not find the Book but rather that it finds us.

If we subscribe to that view, we are making a startling admission — we are really declaring, with humility of course and without realizing it, that we have been chosen to carry out a task related to this Book that has found us. Hopefully, the ‘Missing Link’ workshop will contribute in aiding us to attain our potential for further spiritual growth, and hence to fulfil more effectively, the task expected of us."

Thirty-six pages with excerpts from the Blue Book relating to Joy, Joyous, Joyful, Joyfully, Joys, had been forwarded to participants a few weeks prior to the workshop for them to peruse and note those which would have relevance to what they believed was the ‘Missing Link’.

The day produced some thought provokers and highlighted problem areas for each of us as individuals and was a wonderful group and team experience.

After dinner we had a fun night with Trevor, Kathleen and Richard playing and all of us singing along for about three hours. After fifteen minutes of music, Marijke, the manageress of Halse Lodge asked if she could join us and stayed until midnight.

Saturday consisted of presentations by myself on — The Future — What and How Far Away.

David Regal — Doing our Father's Will in Daily Occupation. Howard Lowe — What is the Value of Meeting with Fellow Believers

Kathleen Swadling — Religion In Society.

After a quick lunch, we were transported to Noosa and spent the afternoon on a boat trip up the Everglades. Cooloola Cruises is a trip not to be missed if you come to this area. The guides were informative and had an obvious love of all God's natural creation.

Saturday night was a Video night with most of us retiring reasonably early.

On Sunday we had presentations (Chaired by Betty Glasziou) from -

Kevin Meyrick — Book Distribution in Australia.

Madeline Noordzy — Six-0-Six Newsletter Information.

William Wentworth — Report as Area Co-ordinator and on his visits to New Zealand and Perth.

Martin Mc Burney — News from Melbourne.

And finally Richard Keeler gave us a talk on his experiences as a URANTIA Book reader for 30 years.

At 1.30 pm we had our usual picture taking with Terry Hovaghimiam, draped with six cameras, doing most of the work and then it was goodbye until next time, God willing, and back to our daily lives.

For myself, and I believe all of the group, we give thanks to God for enabling us to attend what was an encounter of humour, companionship, kindred spirit fraternizing, and growth; and pray our next meeting will be bigger and better and may we become more spiritual as a result of NOOSA 189 .

## International. Encounter In France

The second International meeting organized by the C.E.R.D.H. in France, took place at Montvillargenne from July 30 to August 6 .

About sixty readers came from twelve different countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Great Britain, Holland, Switzerland, U.S.A and France.

The theme of this meeting was “Service”. The participants were divided into groups of 8 or less, including an interpreter, and we thought about what progress a reader can bring in such fields as religion, education, and politics, when he/she has become imbued with the teachings of the 5th Revelation.

During free time, top-quality entertainments were provided by the groups themselves.

It was a time of unforgettable human contacts and no doubt our minds will often be united on the same thought channels in the months to come.

A spiritual fraternity network has been created. Let us keep it alive by visiting or telephoning one another, and may the true friendship that binds us attract members from our respective circles.

From: C.E.R.D.H. Letter No 21, August 1989.

## In His Arms

In His arms — like a child — His child
There is no fear.
His love flows through, — healing, nourishing, spreading. 
Flows through to others, to heal and nourish them.
No hurry, no rush,
I'm already there — In His arms — like a child — His Child.

My brothers and sisters live in fear.
There's no need to.
They too are in His arms — like a child — His child
They want his peace — but it's too simple to grasp.
In time they will see
They're already there — In His arms — like a child 
HIS CHILD

## German Translation?

A private German translation has commenced. Urs Ruchti from Switzerland and our own Jo Hausler from Eumundi, QLD. would like to hear from other interested readers who would enjoy to take part in this important task.

Please contact either:

_Editors Note_: After I talked to Jo Hausler at NOOSA '89, I wrote a letter to Olga Unverzagt, a. German lady in Floridas USA whom I met many years ago when she visited Australia. O1ga is in the process of moving back to Germany and when she heard about the German translation, she wrote back straight away.

I would like to share some excerpts from her letter : ....“What interesting news you are giving me concerning the German translation. I can tell you that this translation has always been very much at my heart. After my retirement I started on some Papers from “The Life of Jesus”, but did not stick with it. Life was going on and it is a time-consuming and not easy task., although I thought the Jesus Papers would be easier. But then I must confess, I am very conscientious and want it to be absolutely correct

Well, several years later I was approached by Asana Du whom I had met at one of the conferences, and he had written to about 7 Germans to start a team for the German translation, but only Eva Van Sant (nee Sepp) and I responded. So Eva and I went ahead; I did the original translation, which I sent to her for checking out and corrections and that went back and forth. At one conference in Oklahoma, where Eva lives, I stayed with her for several days and we worked on a Paper together, which was, of course so much easier than having to write back and forth. Eva is probably even more fussy about getting it right.

Anyway, after a while we stopped the work, since we did not get the support of the URANTIA Foundation. (I always thought, they would be happy if someone wanted to do it no charge). Since we are giving our lifetime for such a responsible job, Eva especially decided not to translate anymore; besides she has a job and a not-too-well husband. The Foundation allowed us to translate for our own sake, but not to give out the translated parts to anyone. But we do not need to give our time to translate just for fun! I speak German still fluently!

And imagine, I had met Nicole and Urs Ruchti at a conference in Oklahoma, but don't remember that Urs was serious about working on the translation himself. Now I know something is going on, I have to approach Asana Duex, now in California, again; he never let me know any more about it as he had promised at one time.

I am thrilled to hear there are a few more Germans in Australia, it requires a team to translate the book. When I return to Germany I will be very busy for a while, but the German translation is of paramount importance and it would be wonderful, if this serious work would now be continued. I definitely will contact the Ruchtis. Maybe a trip to Switzerland (I. have a niece there in Basel and one of her married brothers lives in Zurich) sometime next year could be made. What you wrote me about the Gernan translation sounds really exciting!".....

As readers are undoubtedly aware, the URAVTIA Foundation has the task to protect the copyright of _The URANTIA Book_ and to avoid disappointment it would seem wise to first communicate with them before starting on any translation.

## News From Pennsylvania

A while ago I received a letter from George Zuberbuehler asking me for some information on how to run a newsletter as his study group: was contemplating on starting one. I supplied him with some helpful hints and he replied with the following letter which I would like to share as I'm sure more readers would be interested in our family in Pennsylvania.

Dear Madeline,

Thank you for sharing your experience with the 6-0-6 and the benefits of providing a forum for URANTIA Book students. Some of this information will be useful for us as we develop our plans for sharing the fruits of our study group activity.

In becoming a member of the Brotherhood of Man Library last month, I was happy to discover that the 1986 and 1987 issues of Six-0-Six have been made available through this excellent service of George Sarmis and staff. I trust that the 1988 and subsequent issues will also become available to us in the future.

In order to keep our costs down and to increase readership, it is likely that our future publication will be made available exclusively through the BOML, which happily serves Australia through its facility in Queensland.

Our study group formed in 1985 and during the past four years it has grown from three to about ten regular members. We meet every Wednesday evening, with half of our group having to travel forty to eighty miles each way (several come from Delaware and one from New Jersey). As you can imagine, it takes some dedication for our family to come together once a week, so it is not very often that we have all ten members present at one time.

In February our group began the long-term commitment of reading _The URANTIA Book_ from the first Paper to the last, at a rate of two Papers each month. During this time I have taken about 200 pages of meeting notes. It is thought that some of the comments and discussions that come out of our study may one day form the nucleus of our publication/sharing program. This idea has not been fully decided upon, however, and there is a strong possibility that our newly inaugurated public-speaking effort will provide quite a storehouse of informative material worthy of sharing with others. As you can see, while the final stages of our product await development in the months ahead, there is much in the way of potential and challenge to service.

This public-speaking adventure is presently self-contained. Each week one of the group delivers a prepared five-minute talk on the subject of his or her choosing. This experience receives the additional benefit of a short critique based on the principle of Toastmasters International. It has already become very clear that this approach greatly magnifies our appreciation and understanding of various facets of our wonderful Revelation and it also enhances our ability to share these truths with others.

Once we have begun receiving your Newsletter through the BOML, I foresee many opportunities for our developing a fuller relationship by mail: two study groups sharing truth and love based upon our gift, _The URANTIA Book_."

George Zuberbuehler, White Haven, PA. USA

## History Of Urantia Family In Australia

Ann Bendall has decided to prepare a history of the URANTIA movement in Australia which Ken Glasziou will keep on the Brotherhood of Man Library at Maleny. Could anyone who found the Book before 1980 be able to help her with this project by writing down their recollections of how and when they obtained the Book and the contacts they had in those early days.

Write to: Ann Bendal1, P.0. Box 839, Nambour, QLD. 4560.

## Special 10th Anniversary Edition Of Six-0-Six

## The Star Of Bethlehem Foretold In _The Urantia Book_ ?

Religion and science have long pondered the questions posed by the Star of Bethlehem. Theories abound. Supernovas comets, planetary conjunctions, and the miraculous have been invoked. Some even question if the event ever occurred, let alone how many wise men.

of the many proposals, the planetary conjunction of Saturn and Jupiter is by far the most popular. It isn't new. Johannes Kepler, after discovering the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction in Pisces a few days before Christmas in 1603, calculated backward and discovered the 7 B.C. event. Kepler was not the first to describe this. In 1977, David H. Clark described a similar assertion in English church annals dating from A.D. 1285. In the early days of planetariums, operators abused their Zeiss projectors by running the machines high-speed backwards to 7 B.C., producing the triple conjunction. This triple conjunction means that the retrograde loops of the two planets overlap. Translated, Jupiter passes Saturn three times over a several month period. The last occurrence of this sort was in 1981.

Until recently, all calculations to explain the star of Bethlehem as a planetary grouping relied on the standard ‘Planetary, Lunar, and Solar Positions’ by Bryant Tuckeman. This two volume work, published by the American Philosophical Society in 1962 and 1964, listed the coordinates of the naked-eye members of our solar system at five and ten day intervals from 601 B.C. to A.D. 1649. Utilizing these volumes, the dates proposed for the Jupiter-Saturn conjunction are as follows: May 27, October 6, and December 1, B.C.7.

In 1976, at California's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, a unique project of special interest to historians was undertaken. JPL scientists, together with the U.S. Naval Observatory, calculated the positions of all major bodies in the solar system throughout a span of forty-four centuries, from 1411 B.C. to A.D. 3002 . This attempt proved singular, since they omitted all previous analytical theories of motion for individual objects. This new method embraced a technique of simultaneous numerical integration on a Univac 1100 / 81, inconceivable just a few decades ago. The task required nine days of computer time resulting in a magnetic output known as the 'Long Ephemeris Tape'. Jean-Louis Simon and Pierre Bretagnon of Bureau des Longitudes in Paris published this data in ‘Planetary Programs and Tables from 4000 B.C. to 2800 A.D.’ (Willmann-Bell, 1986).

In the 'Star of Bethlehem' (Sky and Telescope, December, 1986), Roger W. Sinnott “became keenly interested” in reexamining the proposed dates of planetary grouping in light of this new information. He discovered that the dates listed for the conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter were incorrect. Compared to what earlier writers have deduced using Tuckerman's tables, the maximum difference is about five days. The newly calculated conjunctions occur on May 29, September 30 , and December 5 .

This insight is hardly dramatic for astronomers, but intriguing for readers of _The URANTIA Book_. _The URANTIA Book_ was published in 1955. Tuckeman's tables in 1962, and Bretagnon & Simon's programs and tables in 1986. In order to appreciate the significance, a passage from the text follows:

“These priests from Mesopotamia had been told sometime before by a strange religious teacher of their country that he had had a dream in which he was informed that ”the light of life“ was about to appear on earth as a babe and among the Jews. And thither went these three teachers looking for this ”light of life". After many weeks of futile search in Jerusalem, they were about to return to Ur when Zacharias met them and disclosed his belief that Jesus was the object of their quest and sent them on to Bethlehem, where they found the babe and left their gifts with Mary, his earth mother. The babe was almost three weeks old at the time of their visit.

These wise men saw no star to guide them to Bethlehem. The beautiful legend of the star of Bethlehem originated in this way: Jesus was born August 21 at noon, 7 B.C. On May 29, 7 B.C., there occurred an extraordinary conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn in the constellation of Pisces. And it is a remarkable astronomic fact that similar conjunctions occurred on September 29 and December 5 of the same year.Upon the basis of these extraordinary but wholly natural events the well-meaning zealots of the succeeding generation constructed the appealing legend of the star of Bethlehem and the adoring Magi... (_The URANTIA Book_ [UB 122:8.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/122#p8_7))

The tabulated differences in dates follow:

| URANTIA Book(1955) | Tuckerman (1962) | Difference (days) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| May 29 | May 27 | 2 |
| Sept 29 | Oct 6 | 7 |
| Dec 5 | Dec 1 | 4 |

URANTIA Book(1955) | Bretagnon & Simon (1986) | Difference (days) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
May 29 | May 29 | 0
Sept 29 | Sept 30 | 1
Dec 5 | Dec 5 | 0

It is remarkable that the new calculations match so closely with the URANTIA text. The only exception is the calculated date of September 30 and what is listed in the text as September 29. A possible explanation for this discrepancy may be methodological. In 'Computing the Star of Bethlehem', Sinnott states:

> An important matter, when dealing with ancient astronomical events, is the distinction between Ephemeris and Universal time. The two systems run within a minute of each other throughout the last three centuries, but they diverge in the remote past because of slight changes in the length of the Earth's day. For the planetary calculations in this article, I've adopted the value ET - UT = +177 minutes, as recommended by Bretagnon & Simon. But for the lunar eclipses at Herod's death, I used +158 minutes in accordance with the introduction to the Meeus-Mucke canon. The actual value is unknown; a recent study by F.R. Stephenson and L.V. Morrison leans toward +166 minutes near 1B.C. (Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London, Series A, 313,47, 1984).

If changing the time to another value, perhaps +166 minutes as suggested by Stephenson \& Morrison, would make-up the one day variance, is unknown. Further investigation is warranted. For now readers of _The URANTIA Book_ may take solace in discovering that science and their text are converging ever closer on the Star of Bethlehem.

Dr. Matt Neibaur M.D.

---

ADDENDUM: Besides this paper, Dr. Neibaur has published another of great interest to URANTIA Book readers which is concerned with identifying the correct day of the week for a particular day of the week for a particular date during the period when Jesus was here on our planet. _The URANTIA Book_ account of the life of Jesus often makes statements such as “on Wednesday, the 24th March” of a particular year. Imagine the difficulty that any imposter, passing himself off as a revelator, would have had during pre-computer times, to correctly identify the day of the week for a particular date so long ago.

Besides the computational difficulties, changes in the calendar that have since occurred have to be reckoned with. For example, at the time the Gregorian calendar was introduced, there was a discrepancy of about 7 days between the true date and that in actual use.

It is worth noting that the book would have lost nothing if the hypothetical imposter had not attempted the task, a point illustrated by the fact that, for more than 30 years nobody has noticed that such information has been included in _The URANTIA Book_.

Dr. Neibaur researched this problem thoroughly, then wrote a computer program to check on the correctness of 8 such instances where definite days of the week were associated with a particular date during the life of Jesus. In each case the day given by _The URANTIA Book_ is the correct one.

The probability of achieving this result by guesswork is easily calculated. It is 1 chance in 7 , multiplied by itself 8 times, which comes to 1 chance in 5,764,801. A similar calculation can also be made for getting the results for the Star of Bethlehem. Ignoring the fact that the year of occurrence of the conjunctions of Saturn and Jupiter had to be identified correctly, there is 1 chance in 365 of getting the day of the month correct through guesswork. To be correct for the two instances comes to 1 chance in 365 x 365. For the instance where there is a one day difference between _The URANTIA Book_ date and that for the new set of data, the probability that they could be either identical or differ by one day either side through guesswork, is 3 in 365 . Thus the chance for the total result is 1 / 365 x 1 / 365 x 3 / 365, which calculates to 1 chance in 16,209,041.

To calculate the probability for obtaining these two sets of results we simply multiply them together. This tells us that there is only one chance in 93,442 billion of nominating those dates given to us in _The URANTIA Book_ through guesswork alone. Since there was no other way to perform this task in 1955, we are forced to the conclusion that this was a humanly impossible task at the time of publication of _The URANTIA Book_ in 1955.

Readers of this work by Dr. Neibaur must decide for themselves whether they will permit this information to have significance for their own belief structure and, if impressed, whether they will permit the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ to become significant in their own lives.

The spiritual life, to which art belongs and of which she is one of the mightiest elements, is a complicated but definite and easily definable movement forwards and upwards. This movement is the movement of experience. It may take different forms, but it holds at bottom to the same inner thought and purpose.

Veiled in obscurity are the causes of this need to move ever upwards and forwards, by sweat of the brow, through sufferings and fears. When one stage has been accomplished, and many evil stones cleared from the road, some unseen ... hand scatters new obstacles in the way, so that the path often seems blocked and totally obliterated. But there never fails to come to the rescue some human being, like ourselves in everything except that he has in him a secret power of vision.
