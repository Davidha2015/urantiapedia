## We're 10 Years Young!

Yes, Six-0-Six is starting its second decade. From a one sheet newsletter, which was first published in Feb. 1980 by Neil Francey for Australian readers of _The URANTIA Book_, we have grown together to a newsletter which is true to its name Six-O-Six, the number of our planet Urantia, we have indeed become an international form for the exchange of ideas, opinions and information relating to readers of _The URANTIA Book_.

As world events enfolded over the past few months, we URANTIA Book readers were reminded of these words from the book:

> “Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment.” ([UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

We are happy to be part of it all. But remember, without your articles and letters we would cease to exist. So please, keep writing to us, so that together we may keep growing.

In our last issue we promised we would publish a special edition with the best of 10 years of Six-0-Six. Ken Glasziou and Neil Francey have put together a 28 page publication. If you have not ordered your copy already, you can still do so. The price of $15 will help us to purchase a new photocopier. I would like to thank everyone for their generosity in helping us with achieving this target. We are still putting the final touches to it, but you will receive your copy shortly.

This year our national conference will be held near Melbourne from Thurs. Oct. 25 Sun. Oct. 28. We will give you further details about venue and registration in our Mar/Apr. issue.

> “Jesus offered no rules for social advancement; his was a religious mission, and religion is an exclusively individual experience. The ultimate goal of society's most advanced achievement can never hope to transcend Jesus' brotherhood of men based on the recognition of the fatherhood of God. The ideal of all social attainment can be realized only in the coming of this divine kingdom.” [UB 196:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_11)

## Dear Friends

Here is a small contribution to your good work.

We wish all “Down Under” a wonderful decade as we close off this 20th Century working for our Father's kingdom.

Our dear Julia Fenderson finally found release into transition sleep the day after Christmas. We had a grand memorial service for her with lots of UB readers, most of her family and some friends.

Love to you all.

Lucile & Duane Faw, Malibu, CA. USA

## A Special Urantian Remembered

“When the more spiritually and cosmically advanced mortals die, they proceed immediately to the mansion worlds; in general this provision operates with those who have had assigned to them personal seraphic guardians.” ([UB 112:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_10))

I promised myself I would not be sad when I went to a recent memorial service, but I could not stop the flow of tears. I try even now not to be sad as I recall the source of that memorial, but I find a place inside of me is now empty and dark. Strange how similar — joy and melancholia. Both bring tears and intense feelings close to the heart. I wonder about the benefit of each. But benefit there must be because each emotion, each sympathetic response, is spontaneous, non-evoked.

Helen Hutchinson died in October. She lived a reasonable long and healthy life. Neither the length nor the health was what distinguished the life of this Urantian from others, however. This was a real person, a cosmic citizen, a personality in reality that left us this year.

She was the most special person I ever knew. She was the most intelligent person I ever associated with. Things she said to you stuck because you knew she was speaking the truth. She discovered _The URANTIA Book_ when a friend told her he knew of a book that had no human author. At nearly 70 years old she was broadminded enough to allow curiosity and her search for truth to overcome the earthly absurdity of that statement — for that statement was not of this earth, but of Urantia. So she sought the book and found truth therein and believed and showed faith.

More than anyone I have ever known she lived what she believed; and she believed _The URANTIA Book_. She started the reading group in her home shortly after finding the book. She told me it was just something she decided to do. She would be there every Thursday if anyone wanted to come, read, discuss. And they did come. Though sometimes she sat by herself, they did come. Though I did not always attend she never failed to ask me to come — and many times I went just because she asked me. I never failed to learn something new, to understand someone or something better, to grow in someway.

She also held special meetings on Sunday mornings. She always fixed food and we would eat and talk and read. After the Urantians left others would come; to hold bible study or singing practice or something. Her house was there for all believers of God. The last time I went on Sunday morning it was just her and me. We ate, read, and discussed life, philosophy, and _The URANTIA Book_. I always came away feeling like something had been added to my being. She seemed to have a purpose to feed the spirit and nurture the soul while directing the life and guiding the action. But it was thought she was best at stimulating, and I guess that is what I miss most.

Ragged and worn, marked and frayed, her book showed the signs of intense interest and research. Study the U-Book she would say — study it! She was a leader, a teacher, and a real person of strength, compassion, conviction and righteousness as she interpreted it, as _The URANTIA Book_ explains it.

She is gone from us for a season, but I cannot remove her from my heart or my mind. I shall not try to remove her. I only hope the day will come when I can remember her, her life and ways, and her great influence ... without being sad.

Goodbye Helen.

Frank Wright, Frankfurt, West Germany

## Editors Note:

Although I didn't have the pleasure of ever meeting Helen Hutchinson, I feel I knew her a little bit through her writings. Up to two months before she died, she faithfully sent me a copy of her monthly newsletter (or opinion sheet?)

'A Voice of Fort Sanders Faith Sons Knoxville Students of _The URANTIA Book_.

Her favourite topic was ‘eugenics’, which for a lot of people remains a sensitive area.

I would like to give you an excerpt from her last, August 1989 newsletter. I guess I'll please her mostly by letting her speak to you through her own words.

## Having The Mind Of Christ

I was fixing our morning coffee. There was a tiny gravel in my house shoe that irritated me. I removed it, and then said, “That reminds me of the fairy tale about the Princess and the Pea. She could feel the pea through 20 mattresses. That's how they could tell her from a commoner.”

After thinking a minute, I said, “That's why it's so important to be educated. If you're not, you have no store of information for things to remind you of. You have. nothing to think about.”

“When I was teaching, I added children's classics and the Bible to my curriculum. I told my students that I wasn't teaching the Bible to make them believe in any certain religion (although, I did), but just so they would know what people were talking about.”

“Yes”. Jon Lewis answered, “I hear people referring to Svengali, and I don't know what they mean. Who was he?”

“I don't know,” I replied, “but we'll find out”.

We looked in two dictionaries and two encyclopedias and didn't find it. Then Jon decided it must be a fictional character. So we looked in the right place and found it.

We read on page 1969 about when Jesus was alone in Gethsemane. His heart was indescribably heavy. He soothed himself by remembering good things from his earlier years. Then on [UB 160:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p4_12) Rodan tells us : “... build up for yourself and in yourself reserve galleries of beauty, goodness and artistic grandeur.”

Why all the preamble before I get into my subject. You'll see,

On [UB 48:6.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_26) we read: “If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, who always serves you well.”

And on [UB 102:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p4_1) we read: “The technique whereby you can accept another's idea as yours is the same whereby you may ‘let the mind which is in Christ be also in you’.”

Then they proceed to give us 700 pages of the attitudes of Jesus toward nearly every conceivable situation. Also, the first parts of the book were authored by God's Sons or Paradise Sons, and so they also express his attitudes and ideas.

So what do we need to do? Study _The URANTIA Book_. Study and Study and Study. Over and over again. It contains such an incredible amount of “meat” that we'll never remember it all. But the more we remember, the more we can apply the ideas of Jesus to the solutions of our problems.

We can swap our material mind for the mind of Jesus.

Helen Hutchinson.

Thought Adjuster: A chip of the old block.

## Spiritualised Thinking

Like a child I read _The URANTIA Book_ the first tine and I delighted in noting all those lovely sayings like — “If your own mind does not serve you well, you can exchange it for the mind of Jesus of Nazareth, who always serves you well.” ([UB 48:6.26](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_26))

It was all so simple, all I had to do was pray for a mindexchange. Dear Lord, I need to trade this one in and have one like you had when you walked this earth! — and so I prayed and nothing happened. Each morning I would rumnage through my mind and alas it was still the same doltish inadequate brain as the day before.

Then I read “stabilize mind by subordination to spirit”. So I prayed that my Thought Adjuster just take over completely and chuck out all the guff. Rather than do it at daytime, which I felt might be a bit difficult for my Monitor, I decided nighttime, during sleep, would be perhaps the most suitable time. Despite prayers and a totally dedicated desire, again no change.

So I decided it was time to really read what was in the Blue Book, and, guess what? — looks like I am required to do a little bit of work. Many, many gifts our Father has given me, but a spiritualised way of thinking has to be a dedicated concentrated effort on my part — knowing that my Thought Adjuster is giving me all the help, support and insight, but it is an active process on my part.

We are told — “The spiritual forward urge is the most powerful driving force present in this world; the truth-learning believer is the one progressive and aggressive soul on earth.” ([UB 194:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_4))

"The Adjuster is not trying to control your thinking, as such, but rather to spiritualise it, to eternalise it. Neither angels nor Adjusters are devoted directly to influencing human thought; that is your exclusive personality prerogative. The Adjusters are dedicated to improving, modifying, adjusting, and co-ordinating your thinking processes; but more especially and specifically they are devoted to the work of building up spiritual counterparts of your careers, morontia transcripts of your true advancing selves, for survival purposes.

Adjusters work in the spheres of the higher levels of the human mind, unceasingly seeking to produce morontia duplicates of every concept of the mortal intellect. There are, therefore, two realities which impinge upon, and are centered in, the human mind circuits: one, a mortal self evolved from the original plans of the Life Carriers, the other, an immortal entity from the high spheres of Divinington, an indwelling gift from God. But the mortal self is also a personal self; it has personality.

You as a personal creature have mind and will. The Adjuster as a prepersonal creature has premind and prewill. If you so fully conform to the Adjuster's mind that you see eye to eye, then your minds become one, and you receive the reinforcement of the Adjuster's mind. Subsequently, if your will orders and enforces the execution of the decisions of this new or combined mind, the Adjuster's prepersonal will attains to personality expression through your decision, and as far as that particular project is concerned, you and the Adjuster are one. Your mind has attained to divinity attunement, and the Adjuster's will has achieved personality expression.

To the extent that this identity is realized, you are mentally approaching the morontia order of existence. Morontia mind is a term signifying the substance and sum total of the co-operating minds of diversely material and spiritual natures. Morontia intellect, therefore, connotes a dual mind in the local universe dominated by one will. And with mortals this is a will, human in origin, which is becoming divine through man's identification of the human mind with the mindedness of God." (1205:1-4)

> “Trust all matters of mind beyond the dead level of consciousness to the custody of the Adjusters. In due time, if not in this world then on the mansion worlds, they will give good account of their stewardship, and eventually will they bring forth those meanings and values intrusted to their care and keeping. They will resurrect every worthy treasure of the mortal mind if you survive.” ([UB 110:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_4))

And it would be so nice if every so often my Thought Adjuster assured me that I was on the right track, but then that is not necessary. I have dedicated my will to our Father's will being done in every moment of my life, and I know — “It is their mission to effect such mind changes and to make such spiritual adjustments as you may willingly and intelligently authorize, to the end that they may gain more influence over the personality directionization; but under no circumstances do these divine Monitors ever take advantage of you or in any way arbitrarily influence you in your choices and decisions. The Adjusters respect your sovereignty of personality; they are always subservient to your will.” ([UB 110:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_1))

The mind is the gateway through which all must pass. By practicing introspection and that means non-judgmental, every time we get upset with someone, we will normally discover that we had an erroneous belief about life, ourselves, and that other person.

All too often we look at the situation or person but not ourselves. One sobering thought to pull me back on track when I am revelling in an unappreciated, misunderstood, martyr or judge and jury and executioner roll is the sharp reminder that I am subjecting my Thought Adjuster to this garbage. Usually I'm too busy on my little tangent to do this immediately and so my Thought Adjuster has to stomach my guff until it gets its message through — of what purpose is this train of thought, what reality, love or goodness is in it?

> “The indwelling Adjusters are particularly tormented by those thoughts which are purely sordid and selfish; they are distressed by irreverence for that which is beautiful and divine, and they are virtually thwarted in their work by many of man's foolish animal fears and childish anxieties.” ([UB 108:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p6_2))

I pray one day the time lag will decrease between my tangents and awareness of the presence of a part of God in my mind subjected to my nonsense, and one day a little later it will not be necessary to send a message and that day my Thought Adjuster will have succeeded in removing all the error in my mind.

Another technique I have is prayerfully asking what would Jesus do in this situation — but with a large percentage of my life experiences I suspect he would have had the sense and honesty enough to have avoided them in the first place.

_The URANTIA Book_ has given us so many clues and precise guidelines and these are invaluable. The morontia mota help us to understand the attitudes we must adopt to have peace. Michael's life on earth, his sermons, talks and parables show us the way. But the spiritualisation of my thinking is an individualistic task different from anyone elses. My Achilles heel will not be my neighbours'. That which to me is easy could be difficult for you, and that pet stultifier to which I am totally oblivious may stick out like a sore thumb to a person who truly loves and cares for me.

Perhaps they may see my fault through limited vision and perhaps with the insight of their Thought Adjuster.

It would be nice to dissect me and get the thinking in order, then work on the emotional maturity and the cosmic morality and all the other bits and pieces — but that is not how growth occurs. Growth is exciting and all embracing. If we work on the cleaning out of the materialistic cobwebs from the corridors of our mind so our Thought Adjuster can guide us to the true, real world, we will discover we have grown emotionally in the process. Our hearts will fill with love, as we realise we now know our father just a little bit more but the process of loving requires us to care enough to honestly understand another person a little bit better, God can only reveal himself as we increase our capacity to comprehend Him. The more we spiritualise our thinking the more we can love and appreciate just how great, and beautiful, and true, and loving and wise, etc. our Father is with a double edged blessing that we also appreciate how little we know.

“Spirituality becomes at once the indicator of one's nearness to God and the measure of one's usefulness to fellow beings. Spirituality enhances the ability to discover goodness in values. Spiritual development is determined by capacity therefor and is directly proportional to the elimination of the selfish qualities of love.” ([UB 100:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_4))

## What Language Did Jesus Speak

_The URANTIA Book_ gives us a privileged insight into Jesus' entire life, from birth to death, and when we read of Jesus' early life and education, we see that Jesus' childhood was not essentially different to that of millions of other children. But Jesus' earthly bestowal took place in a linguistically and culturally very diverse environment, which demanded of him the learning of at least two languages. Even at the tender age of five years, we read on [UB 123:2.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p2_14) that Jesus ...“did much of his early practice at writing Aramaic, Greek, and later on, Hebrew, for in time he learned to read, write, and speak, fluently, all three languages.”

We know that Jesus was quite a gifted student, but he was not learning “foreign” languages for pleasure or intellectual exercise; they were a real requirement of everyday life in Jesus' environment. On [UB 123:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p3_1), when Jesus is 6 years old, we read:

> “Already, with his mother's help, Jesus had mastered the Galilean dialect of the Aramaic tongue; and now his father began teaching him Greek. Mary spoke 1ittle Greek, but Joseph was a fluent speaker of both Aramaic and Greek. The textbook for the study of the Greek language was the copy of the Hebrew scriptures — a complete version of the law and the prophets, including the Psalms — which had been presented to them on leaving Egypt. ..... And in a very short time he could read it readily.”

Jesus had more or less perfected his knowledge of the two main languages by the age of 7 , as we read in ‘School Days in Nazareth’ on [UB 123:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_1),

“Already this lad was a fluent reader, writer, and speaker of two languages, Aramaic and Greek. He was now to acquaint himself with the task of learning to read, write, and speak the Hebrew language.”

The teaching of Hebrew was conducted even more by rote than that of Aramaic and Greek, as we learn that the chazan taught it from the Book of the Law. Furthermore, on [UB 123:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_11) ...“at this time the Jews had just inaugurated a compulsory education law” ....

We can infer from this that the Jews had a great deal of administrative freedom in this far-flung part of the Roman empire, in being able to legislate on educational matters and preserve the status of the Hebrew language even though the culture and religion it represented had nothing to do with Rome. From the many references to Greek culture (which the young Jesus openly admired, much to his father's disapproval) we can understand the importance of Greek among the Galileans — it was the prestige language of culture and trade. The fact that Jesus learned the “Galilean dialect” of Aramaic indicates that it was a fairly widely-spoken language, but we know very little of its use or literary heritage. Conspicuously absent from all this, of course, is Latin. It seems that the Romans made little or no attempt to impose their Latin language and culture on these people, who were already exposed to so many influences. Indeed, the Zealots, whom Jesus was urged to join in his teenage years, were not objecting to the imposition of Rome culture so much as to the humiliation of paying taxes to Rome. ([UB 127:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/127#p2_1))

We know what Latin and Ancient Greek were like, and Biblical Hebrew has been preserved to the present day and even resurrected in this century, but what of Jesus' own mother tongue, his home language, Aramaic?

“Eli, Eli, lema sabaktani” (my God, my God, why have you forsaken me) — the words of a psalm that Jesus recalled in his semi-conscious state during his last hours on the cross recorded by the Gospel of Matthew and later the subject of much misinterpretation, are practically the only recorded words of Aramaic that we know Jesus to have spoken. The New Testament itself was written in Greek. And though Hebrew was a very ancient language of the Jews, in Galilee and Judea its Semitic relative, Aramaic, had taken the upper hand. Already by Jesus' time, Aramaic had been one of the most widely-spoken languages of the Middle East. For a couple of centuries — since the conquest of Babylon in 538 BC — it had been the official language of a large part of the Persian empire. The Persian kings made their diplomats and other high officials communicate with their subordinates and with the outside world in Aramaic — not in Assyrian or Persian, which might have seemed more natural. One might well ask why. The answer is still not clear to scholars, but perhaps it may become clearer some time in the next century, when all the Aramaic words that have been preserved for posterity are interpreted. There are about 40,000 of them.

The work of compiling a complete lexicon of this old international language has only just begun, according to a report in ‘The New York Times’. Even with the help of computers it will take twenty years. The work is being carried out at three American universities — John Hopkins in Baltimore, the Catholic University in Washington and the Hebrew Union College in Cincinnati. The project leader is Dr. Delbert Hillers of John Hopkins.

The corpus of material for the lexicon is made up of inscriptions and writings from a time span of nearly two and a half thousands years. The later time-boundary has been drawn at 1400 AD. That does not mean that the language had died out by then. It has survived to the present, and is still spoken and is still spoken in certain parts of Syria and Iraq, and by Christian groups elsewhere in the world — even in America, by a Syrian-Orthodox community in Hackensack, New Jersey! But is it like Jesus' Aramaic? From the period after the Babylonian captivity, in the sixth century BC, Aramaic began to spread at the expense of Hebrew among the Israelites of Palestine, and soon it became the general spoken and written language of the area. And thus it was to remain until Mohammed's teachings thrust Arabic forward in the seventh century AD.

As a religious language, too, Aramaic supplanted Hebrew in the centuries immediately preceding Jesus' earthly bestowal.

Some short passages in the 0ld Testament are written in Aramaic — one verse of Jeremiah, almost three chapters in the Book of Ezra, and about six in the [Book of Daniel, from Chapter 2 , verse 4](/en/Bible/Daniel/2#v4).

In the story of Belshazzar's Feast, there are other words in Aramaic. That is the writing on the wall, passing sentence on the king and his kingdom: “Mene mene tekel u-farsin”. Daniel's interpretation of this in the Bible is that: “(God) has reckoned (the days of your kingdom), you are weighed (on scales and found wanting). (Your kingdom) has been divided (and given to the Medes and Persians.”)

How correct this interpretation is will be shown when the lexicographers have made sense of the Aramaic words. Even if the sense is the same, the original text is perhaps more prosaic

Among the Dead Sea Scrolls, the incredible collection of writings found in the Qumran caves outside Jerusalem, there are some texts in Aramaic, including a translation of the Book of Job. However, there are no texts in Aramaic among them that can tell us anything about early Christianity.

When the Aramaic lexicon is completed, the entire preserved vocabulary from the glorious antiquity of the Middle East will be accessible to modern research. Of the five other great languages of the region, Egyptian and Hebrew already have dictionaries. At the university of Chicago, two other monumental lexical works are approaching completion. One of them deals with Akkadian, the language of the Assyrians and Babylonians, and was begun in 1921, but will soon be finished, according to Erica Reiner, who has been in charge of it for the last 36 years.

For over 50 years, other scholars at the same university have been working on a lexicon of the Hittite language, spoken in a powerful and expansive empire in Asia Minor which existed for nearly a millennium before Jesus' bestowal. This lexicon will be ready soon, too. And in 1976 work started on a complete dictionary of Sumerian, the first great written language in the world. So perhaps even Jesus' language can be reconstructed!

## Fandor — Passenger Bird Of Urantia

“BEHEMOTH BIRD'S FOSSILS FOUND BY SCIENTISTS.” This is the headline of a news report I was given by Helen Hutchinson. The report was made in 1980 I believe, one year before I started studying _The URANTIA Book_.

One of man's greatest desires seems to be to fly. It is reported that flying enters the dream fantasies of humans and is a sign of intelligence. I remember having a lucid dream recently. As soon as I realized I was asleep and dreaming (I did this by repeatedly slapping my own face in my dream; when I did not wake up as there was no pain, I immediately realized I was asleep and dreaming.) I started flapping my arms and amazingly started to rise through the air. I soared above and around buildings and fields. My view was that of a bird. I was breathless. Though it lasted less than a minute I am sure, it was one of the most exhilirating experiences I have ever had. In fact I have dreamed of flying many times, and only once in a plane. All the others were as a bird, flapping and rising, soaring and hovering, sometimes tipping the cornstalks with my feet as I furiously skimmed the open fields of my dream world. It has always fascinated me, and still does.

Man has watched the birds and longed to fly like them, with them, or on them for thousands of years. We who read _The URANTIA Book_ understand this desire better than most because we have been introduced to the real passenger birds of our planet, the fandors.

The rise of the fandor started about 45 million years ago. A large ostrichlike bird that stood about 10 feet tall and laid an egg 9 by 13 inches was the early ancestor of the fandors. ([UB 61:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_9)) In the days of Caligastia and the Caligastia one hundred, about 500,000 years ago, Bon, the director of the board of animal domestication and utilization, led his group to the successful training and use of the giant passenger birds. ([UB 66:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_6))

Adam and Eve used these marvellous creatures some thirty-eight thousand years ago. “From the large passenger birds the fandors — Adam and Eve looked down upon the vast stretches of the Garden while being carried through the air over this, the most beautiful spot on earth.” ([UB 74:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p3_4)) On [UB 74:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p4_4) it again mentions their use by the Material Son and Daughter of Urantia, “...even while the passenger birds were swiftly winging to bring them to the temple...” “The early races also make extensive use of the larger flying animals. These enormous birds are able to carry one or two average-sized men for a nonstop flight of over five hundred miles.” ([UB 52:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_5)) Even though many of our ancestors were smaller than modern man this was no easy load. Adam and Eve, remember, were both over eight feet tall. ([UB 74:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p1_1))

On [UB 52:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p1_5) the Book explains that on some planets these birds are of great service because they possess a high level of intelligence and can often speak many words of the languages of the realm. It goes on to describe them as highly intelligent, obedient, and unbelievably affectionate. I am sure people who ride horses will be able to identify with this description. I would like to point out as well, had you never seen or heard of a horse, you probably would not believe such a creature could exist, so perfectly fitted to man's early needs were they. ([UB 61:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_10))

The bones of the bird were found in Argentina, about 100 miles west of Buenos Aires, by Drs. Eduardo P. Tonni and Rosendo Pascual of Argentina's La Plata Museum. Parts of three different wing bones and parts of the skull were uncovered. Dr. Kenneth E. Campbell, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County, stated, “This makes it the world's largest known flying bird.” The remains are of a bird that measured 11 feet from beak to tail, weighed between 160 and 170 pounds, and stood over 6 foot tall. “It's definitely a most spectacular creature,” said Campbell.

Most spectacular indeed. If they only knew how spectacular it must have been to ride the back of one of these magnificent creatures. Compared to todays birds they were truly enormous. The biggest flying bird alive is the Andean Condor with a 10 foot wingspan and a weight of about 35 pounds. Even fossil records show the biggest previously known flying birds were extinct varieties with wingspans approaching 16 feet. The bones found in Argentina were identified to be similar to a teratorn, a bird resembling a condor but much larger. Although no one knows exactly what teratorns looked like, these “wonder birds” named by the Greeks, are thought to have flown like condors, and the representation is based on these facts.

How sad that these great birds were allowed to disappear from our planet. I think of similar animals that may prove beneficial to mankind being completely lost to our future. The elephant, nemesis of some, workhorse of others, may be lost to our descendants if our attitude about them does not change. Only in the region of India do the people realize this animal is suited perfectly for heavy work in the jungle. Ironically, the elephants are being used to clear the jungle itself, thereby literally working themselves out of a job, and maybe a life.

But the fandors, even though extinct on Urantia for over thirty-thousand years, [UB 66:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p5_6), are not gone forever. They are waiting for us on Jerusem, capital of Satania, our local system. It states on [UB 46:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p2_4) while describing the physical features of Jerusem, “The transport birds fly at about one hundred miles an hour.” So maybe our dreams are not for naught. I still hope someday to soar through the air on one of these wonderful birds.

## Organisational Changes In Chicago

As most readers know, there has been a series of changes in the major organizations serving students of _The URANTIA Book_. The ramifications of these changes are by no means clear as yet, and only time will reveal their outworking.

From what I can make out, URANTIA Foundation has discontinued its support of URANTIA Brotherhood by rescinding its right to use the name “URANTIA”, and also by terminating the agency under which the Brotherhood distributed _The URANTIA Book_.

This means that the Brotherhood had to choose a name which does not include the word “URANTIA”, and it has chosen the interim title “The Fifth Epochal Fellowship” pending consultation with its membership over a suitable new name.

The Fifth Epochal Fellowship that has no special relationship with URANTIA Foundation and functions as one — albeit very much the biggest — of the organizations dedicated to disseminationg the book and its teachings without use of the name “URANTIA” or the concentric circles symbol.

URANTIA Foundation, on the other hand, now has no organic connection with the readership, and has brought into existence a new body called “URANIIA Brotherhood Association” to undertake this function. Only time will tell whether these new arrangements are workable or not.

The cause of the rift seems to me to be a combination of factors which have been building up for some years. Clearly one precipitating cause of dissension has been differences of opinion between Foundation and Brotherhood over the use of the name “URANTIA” and the concentric circles symbol. The Foundation has a clear legal obligation to protect these symbols, while the Brotherhood, naturally enough, wanted to make wide use of them. There is a history of disagreement and conflict over this matter reaching back for 10 or 15 yrs.

In addition, there seem to have been personal conflicts which came to a head over the last year or so, some also going back for many years.

Who knows what else may have been involved? Australian readers are not directly involved at this stage, and although disappointed that the disagreements were not resolved without such drastic action, are not yet being asked to decide anything. But the question of book distribution may involve us sooner or later. In addition, the channel which URANTIA Brotherhood used to inform new readers about study groups and other readers in their vicinity is now defunct, as new readers will make contact with URANTIA Foundation — not the Fifth Epochal Fellowship.

Apart from these two areas, about which we may need to take some action soon, I don't myself see any reason why the new arrangements will be any worse than the old ones. But it is rather an unseemly mess all the same, isn't it?
