## “Thought For The Month” 

> “The salvation of God for the mortals of Urantia would have been just as effective and unerringly certain if Jesus had not been put to death by the cruel hands of ignorant mortals. If the Master had been favorably received by the mortals of earth and had departed from Urantia by the voluntary relinquishment of his life in the flesh, the fact of the love of God and the mercy of the Son — the fact of sonship with God — would have in no wise been affected. You mortals are the sons of God, and only one thing is required to make such a truth factual in your personal experience, and that is your spirit-born faith.” _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 186:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/186#p5_9)

## New Zealand Readers' Weekend Meeting

Last year some of the readers in New Zealand got together for a weekend meeting, a first for most of us here, and a very valuable experience. We met at Neville and Trish Twist's house in Auckland, on the 14th and 15th October 1989, and comprised the Auckland study group plus Susan and Colin Hermingsen from Wellington. A group of readers from Hamilton had been invited, but were unable to make it this time.

The meeting started with a presentation by Mark McEwan, who gave us a very concise overview of life according to _The URANTIA Book_ from an individual point of view, describing all the myriad spiritual influences on each of us and how it all interacts, complete with diagrams. This was followed by a very thought-provoking presentation from Neville dealing with apparent inconsistencies in the Book regarding seraphic velocities.

We spent the afternoon reading the paper on Christianity's Problem, which generated much discussion, as we all come from varying religious backgrounds, and have quite different viewpoints.

The day was rounded off by listening to some of the Sadler tapes, which we have acquired thanks to Trevor and Kathleen Swadling, and which I for one find utterly fascinating, coming as they do from the very beginnings of _The URANTIA Book_. Most of the group then indulged in a meal from the local Indian takeaway place, which by all accounts turned into quite a test of one's tolerance for high spice levels!

On Sunday morning we were just discussing what paper to read, when two visitors arrived, and at their request we read from 'Government On A Neighbouring Planet', and some quite intriguing ideas came forth on how parts of this paper could be applied to modern day Urantia. Our visitors were quite new to the Book, but were also keen to promote their own particular interests, and turned the discussion to astral travel and channeling. I would like to share this with other readers, as I think it happens quite a lot, and we as a group have discussed it several times before, i.e. the appropriate way of relating to people who express an interest in the Book but see it as one of many sources of truth and wisdom, and who investigate everything. In _The URANTIA Book_ we are encouraged to find out about other religions and to take the best from them all, but do we do this in the context of a study group or is it best done individually? We would welcome any comment on this.

Our meeting progressed through Sunday lunch, followed by a short discussion on multi-cultural and multi-lingual aspects, and winding up with a general agreement that the weekend had been very successful and we must do it again soon! Hopefully next time we will be joined by the group in Hamilton, and really start to sow the seeds of a New Zealand URANTIA Book fraternity.

## The Purpose Of The 5th Epochal Revelation

Is It The Recruitment of Genuine Apostles?

What is the specific purpose of the Fifth Epochal Revelation on this planet? While this may seem obvious to very many readers of _The URANTIA Book_, to others who are familiar with the finest concepts and teachings of Christianity as well as the best in several other of the world's religions and philosophies, the answer is not so obvious. Excepting for detailed information on the hierarchical structure among the heavenly hosts that we have no means of verifying, much of the Book's content has been stated elsewhere. Neither do the scientific aspects of the Book bring much new knowledge and certainly little that we were not due to discover independently within a short time after the Book's publication.

Perhaps the simplest conclusion is that it has been given to us in order that we should recognize our sonship with the Father and the brotherhood of all men. But that message is not new, so is there some other purpose for this revelation? Undoubtedly part of its purpose is to rectify error that has partially negated the effectiveness of the 4th Epochal Revelation. Another purpose would be to amplify upon our knowledge of our place in the totality of God's creation. But why has this new revelation cone to us specifically at this time, and not 1000 years hence or whence?

To try to answer this question, let us take a look at URANTIA Paper 99, “The Social Problems of Religion”, written by a Melchizedek of Nebadon and addressed specifically to problems currently confronting our planet. In the past, religion did not have to adjust its attitude to extensive changes in economic and political systems; today the rapidity of changes in living conditions are such that institutional modifications must be greatly accelerated, and religion must quicken its adaptation to an ever-changing social order. We are told that this period of gross instability will endure for 1000 years; that the human race must become reconciled to a procession of changes, adjustments, and readjustments, and that mankind is on the march toward a new and unrevealed destiny.

If we believe in the validity of the 5th Epochal Revelation, we have no option other to than to take these prophetic statements into account. Many of us may feel an urgency about getting on with changing and saving the world right now. But this prophecy is telling us that as fast as we remedy a world problem, new changes will be occurring that will require different adjustments and this situation will be with us for at least 1000 years. What is the role of religion to be? [Paragraph 2 of Section 1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_2) states:

“Religion must become a forceful influence for moral stability and spiritual progression,” and in [paragraph 3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p1_3), “The paramount mission of religion as a social influence is to stabilize the ideals of mankind during these dangerous times of transition from one phase of civilization to another, from one level of culture to another.” Paragraph 4 tells us there are no new religious duties to perform, that the role of religion is to be a wise guide and experienced counselor. But the leaders of our best religious institutions know all that, and there is certainly plenty of wisdom and experience to draw upon in the churches, seminaries, theological colleges, university departments of religion and so on. So why was the 5th Epochal Revelation necessary?

Perhaps Section 2 of the Paper supplies an answer to this question. We are told that institutional religion is unable to provide the necessary leadership and inspiration because it is in a catch 22 situation. It cannot reconstruct itself until society has been radically reconstructed. Section 2 then goes on to tell us that religionists must function in society, industry, and politics as individuals, not as groups or institutions.

Some of us have been inclined to think that from the time of publication of _The URANTIA Book_ in 1955, those who gave us the Papers have left us to work out our own destiny. This is only partially true. If we search the Book conscientiously and prayerfully, we find that much explicit instruction is given even for questions that have since caused much perplexity and disruption. For example, the references just quoted tell us that for a long time to come the main role of religion in the advancement of our civilization rests not with institutions but with the individual. this is confirmed in Section 3, paragraph 4 which states that: “The attainment of a high cultural civilization demands,: first, the ideal type of citizen and, then, ideal and adequate social mechanisms wherewith such a citizenry may control the economic and political institutions of such an advanced human society.”

Summarizing these comments, we have been told that we have a 1000 year job in front of us that initially should be confined virtually entirely to the production of ideal citizens who will, as individuals, serve to stabilize the moral and spiritual progression of society during these rapid periods of change. However the requirements for producing an ideal citizenry have been known to millions upon millions of Christians for nigh 2000 years. Where then is Christianity deficient, and how is _The URANTIA Book_ telling us to compensate for that deficiency? Perhaps the answer to that question is that the vast majority of Christians know, but do not live the message of Jesus. Undoubtedly a very large proportion of practicing Christians are genuine believers and qualify to be called disciples of Jesus. But according to _The URANTIA Book_ there is a considerable difference between the requirements for discipleship and apostleship. Perhaps then, the demand being placed upon us by the 5th Epochal Revelation is that we must follow the original twelve apostles into apostleship!

The qualifications for apostleship are set out in Paper 140 of _The URANTIA Book_. It is quite possible to read this Paper and to conclude that it was meant only for the original twelve. But this is not so. In Section 1, paragraph 4 , apostleship is offered to all who would take the path of the twelve. That offer is reiterated in Section.3, paragraph 20 where Jesus says, “But everyone who hears this charge and sincerely executes his commission to represent me before men even as I have represented my Father to you, shall find abundant entrance into $m y$ service and into the kingdom of the heavenly Father.” Thus we need to consider whether the real demands of the 5th Epochal Revelation may be for firstly hundreds, then thousands, followed by millions upon millions of URANTIA Book students all willing to undertake the pathway of apostleship.

Allowing that our train of thought may be close to the truth, what does it all mean for the present crop of URANTIA Book readers. It has been said that ultimately we are judged by the highest standards that we know, hence if we know the standards set out in _The URANTIA Book_, then those are the standards by which we shall be judged. Though at first URANTIA Book readers may be permitted to nominate as disciples, and hence avoid the rigorous demands of apostleship, this cannot be a continuing state. If we have received the Book, read it thoroughly and understood its message, we must accept the challenge of apostleship or risk the consequences of rejection.

One difference between discipleship and apostleship as announced by Jesus is that, in undertaking apostleship, we elect to represent him in the world in the same way that, in his human life on Urantia, he represented the Father. This is certainly a rigorous undertaking, for it is not by the words we speak but by the lives we live that we will represent Jesus to the world.

Apostleship is a demanding but enormously spiritually rewarding undertaking. Many of its requirements are set out in Paper 140, and need to be fully understood as, in undertaking apostleship, we place ourselves permanently on trial before the bar of human judgment. The Christian experience has been that it requires unchristian behaviour from a relatively small proportion of Christians to bring a highly damaging and condemnatory reaction. Perhaps it is in recognition of this fact that we find an extraordinarily harsh judgmental statement in _The URANTIA Book_ that perhaps applies only to those who undertake apostleship. It was made by Jesus during a resurrectional appearance to a group at Tyre who may all have been of apostleship status. It occurs on p. 2054 and says: “And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead; the Spirit of Truth is not in them; they are useless branches on the living vine, and they will soon be taken away.”

In conclusion we offer one final thought. There has been a considerable division of opinion about how the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ should be spread to the general community. Just as the answer to the problem of what our role should be in our daily lives is to be found in the Book, so the answer to that question of how the teachings are to be spread is also in the Book. It was given to us by a Divine Counselor acting by the authority of the Ancient of Days on Uversa and appears in the third paragraph of p. 43 of _The URANTIA Book_. There is only one work on this planet that can fit the description given there of “enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness,” and that is _The URANTIA Book_ itself. Just as Paper 99 addressed the current problems of this age, so too this direction is for right now and is to farsighted men and women of spiritual insight and with the necessary skills and abilities, using _The URANTIA Book_ as source material, to conduct those secondary works that will permit the teachings of the Book to penetrate to all segments of all societies and thus “attract all that is good in the mind of man and challenge that which is best in the human soul.” Who would dare argue with such authority?

## Relief Associated With Being A Urantia Book Reader

“Know the truth and the truth will set you free”.

What a wondrous relief to know that we are living in a loving universe of order. And for myself to discover that I have been running around like an idiot looking for those things which are, in reality, ever present with me.

To name but a few:

1. A master — I need seek no master. For eternity, I have a Master, someone to lead me and that someone is Michael the way, the truth, and the light. In Michael we have a beautiful loving Creator Son who knows exactly the planet on which we live and what it feels like to live as a mortal and as we stumble our way up to Paradise, we know he is either “dragging” us or “pushing” us at times — forever our master and leader.
2. A guru — all I need to know is, my guru is my Thought Adjuster who, hopefully, one day will be my Thought Controller. I need not rumlage through books or chase after human beings. All I need is to prayerfully ask and, assuming the time is right, and my ability to comprehend is uncluttered by false illusions of myself, the world and other people, the answer will be given. And, I will hear the answer as it is said.
3. Relation to other people. I need no longer try to work out who you are and why we met. Why shouldn't we meet? We are all brothers and sisters. For what purpose do brothers and sisters have to have contact with each other?
4. What I have to do in life — It is really very simple, all I have to do is God's will and that means H$ i s W$ i 11 in H$ is T$ i me.
5. Why an I not like everyone else? The answer is simple. I am an individual and conversely everyone else is not like me (when I am on a self-importance trip) — they are individuals.
6. Why I don't understand myself — because I am a potential, and I will never understand me for I will never comprehend my potential. And, we are advised in the Blue Book that the only persons who fully understand themselves are the Universal Father, the Eternal Son and the Conjoint Actor.
7. That I'm not going to have knowledge handed to me without experience, because I will forget it at the moment of essential recall requirement. Knowledge will be embraced into my being through personal experience and so it will become me.
8. That growing emotionally does not mean foregoing the simplicity of pleasure of a child, it just deepens the enjoyment.
9. That I don't have to “save” anyone or be responsible for anyone's quality of life — that's between themselves and God, all I have to do is love them as our Father would like me to love them.
10. That I am not “luckier” or more blessed, just more aware of how blessed I am than some of my brothers and sisters.
11. That it is alright to have questions and the answers will be given at the soonest possible opportunity, which might be when I am a finaliter. The delay in answering is purely due to inability to comprehend on my part at this point in time.
12. That I am not perfect, nor is perfection expected of me. In reality I am the most imperfect creature in the universe (or more correctly species of creatures).

On the pathway to perfection it is expected that I will fail at times. At times it will look like failure, but it will purely and simply be a delay. At other times it will be failure; and as I call it failure so again will come the next opportunity to, in this instance, succeed, with-me having had the wondrous experience of ignorance, followed by knowledge through experience of where I went astray, to ensure perfect success the next time. We live in a loving universe, a universe of understanding and patience.

And I could go on and on for 2097 pages, but today I haven't got time and so I share with you some of the truths which this day I thank our Father for, and for which I love Him heaps and heaps.

## We Too Can “Phone Home”

Why should E.T. be the only one to phone home across the light-years of the universe? We would probably be staggered by the amount of his phone bill. E.T.'s advanced technical knowledge enabled him to construct a cosmic telephone out of the odds and ends he found around his host's house. That requires quite a bit of ingenuity, but fortunately, we do not have to have the advanced capability to construct such an interplanetary communications system. If we ever try to communicate cosmically, we discover to our delight that to call the Designer of the entire universe conversational apparatus, the phone we need is already installed and ready for use. There is no installation charge, no need for repair with normal use, and no activation fee. Even the expense of the receiver and sender is abrogated by the prior preparation of the Master Communications Executive. Just as we discovered that we have the vocal apparatus to converse with as a child, so is it revealed to us that a far more intricate and critically designed cosmic phone system is already at our disposal.

Just as a caring and loving parent is delighted to receive a phone call from a son or daughter whom they have not heard from recently, so does the Phone designer likewise eagerly await our calls. When we see the flashing red light on our mechanical phone answering machine, we pick up the receiver and discover that the Phone Fashioner has already left a message of love and truth to start off our use of the cosmic phone. The Fashioner has left his number and the area code of astronomic region of his phone which is used on the initial phone home experience. It seems to be up to the client as to whether he will return a response to the message recorded on his call-receiving machine. After the phoner chooses to answer the call, utilizing the priorly prepared phone system, it is no longer necessary to employ either the phone number nor area code. Thereafter, the phoner needs only pick up the receiver and the Designer is already on the line waiting to receive his calls.

These phones are now available in a cordless style which affords the phoner the liberty to walk or even travel about taking the phone mechanics with him. Once the system is grounded in the receiving unit at the phoner's home, the remote cosmic phone can be employed at any place and at any time. The Designer has a little-understood immeasurable personal fortitude and does not require sleep to continue his 24-hour-a-day availability. Mysteriously, the Designer is able to work all the shifts of the phone company.

As we remarked above, the Designer has made an ample allotment of energy to keep the phone system going and he insists on our calling collect, which is a great relief, seeing that we could hardly afford very many such ExtraLong-Distant phone calls. Since the Designer is always already on the line waiting to be called, it is as though there is no “extra-long-distance” to be overcome whatsoever. In a scientifically inexplicable way, our individual receivers are instantaneously in touch with the Designer, and as use becomes a frequent activity, it is just as though the Designer's Being were in the receiver itself.

One advantage of the cosmic phone system is that it provides a way for us to get the Designer's. viewpoint on the evolving and improving communications systems throughout the universe. While there. are many crews still working in the open field with more and more communicators signing up every day, there remains a lot to be mastered in the intra-universe, client-to-client communications. However, there are “clearing house” activities available which can be dispatched through our receivers which will be referred to the appropriate party. Once a client signs up for a portable model, the incompletion of the whole of the cosmic communications network ceases to be an impediment. Likewise can receivers get in touch with other receivers, but that technology is so advanced that we really have no complete operations manual to explain its functions.

The receiver cones with a built in device which makes it possible for it to function with the wisdom of the Designer and work in the association of the universe of phone subscribers who have “Independent Receiver Activities”. IRA's are able to place calls with other parties and to store valuable information which it can later pass on to its client when he has improved his phone-call-comprehension capacity sufficiently to understand these messages from on high.

On earth we can transcend the immediate situations of life by talking with the Designer over our portable phone modules, someone who has real knowledge about reality and unconditional know-how concerning all the networking desires of all clients. Getting the glimpse that the Designer can get to us without over-powering the circuit breaker and causing faulty transmission, affords us something of his perspective on the entire network. He is able to respond to any functional or personal need of any client. What a resource connection!

The Designer has an unlimited capacity to have new phone lines opening all the time. Incomprehensibly, he can talk with us with what we would call “total attention and solicitous listening” even though he is also connected with a wide array of other phone clients in all universe phone localities.

When there are occasional storms in various regions, some of the power line and communications lines may be temporarily severed, but there are already every possible back-up communications systems which operate while the repair is going on in the storm areas.

The Cosmic Phone Designer is immeasurably superior to our Urantia experts of interpersonal communications devices, even including the Icarus-like communications devices orbitting Urantia and relaying communications. All such devices, however, do have a finite life-expectation and will eventually experience the wax being melted as the sky soaring device returns to plunge into a planetary ocean.

Among the superior factors of the Cosmic Phone System are: One never places a call and receives a busy signal, nor the delay of a message-taking contrivance. There are always more operators than are necessary to respond to or forward our calls to the Designer and his Phone Staff. We will, therefore, never be put “on hold”.

While we will never receive a phone bill, the Designer would appreciate it sometime if we would share his special 800 toll-free number with any of our associates or acquaintances who are oblivious to the Cosmic Phone Network. The Designer has such a transcendental communications ideal he is seeking to realize that it is highly important that every possible receiver should be activated in all potential clients.

When there are confusions on Urantia, picking up the phone to the Designer is a sure way to receive a message of comfort and conciliation with a reminder that there were some phone vandals in our area code the effects of which have not all been yet eradicated.

If we have no special message to relay, the Cosmic Caller always is delighted to send us messages as well. His favorite message is that all is going well for each client and the technological progress of the entire phone system. Actually, all clients are already having their communications improved upon and attunement to the “Designer in the Receiver” makes direct non-circuit-transmitted communications with the Celestial Caller possible.

There is speculation as to whether the Designer's communications system shall so improve as to make it possible for a planet-wide phone-a-thon, in which subscribers to the Cosmic Phone System will call every subscriber in the Designer's phone book so that all planetary individuals will be contacted with and inspired by the discovery of a worldwide, person-to-person relationship which can be had when phone subscriptions become virtually universal.

The free use of one's receiver is unqualified. All phone calls are voluntary, and can be limitlessly beneficial. The Designer installs potential phones in every client, but he doesn't use them to dictate instructions to clients. Those who subscribe to the Phone Company do so for the delight and incomparable improvement which such calls make possible.But it must remain possible for a potential client to have his own phone disconnected. However, withdrawal from the Celestial Phone Circuits which renders impaired and sometimes negated communications possibilities, with the Designer a new problem, also disconnects one's communications with other clients. When this happens, special agents call the 911 numbers and every effort is made to convey the advantages of network membership, and sometimes this is successful and inclusion in the universal phone ship is restored.

The Designer is fully capable of setting up unlimited conference-calling with enormous numbers of his phone staff. It is through such group communications as these that the overall system of phone ship continues to improve, grow, and acquire new features. The Designer does actually confer co-designer ship with his clients and is open for their creative suggestions as to how the overall network can be improved. Crucial in the functioning of the phone-domain is the individual attention which must be rendered to every potential subscriber, and this keeps in creative readiness a tremendous Staff which can even include phone clients themselves. It seems that some of the best messages that will ever come through await the improvement of the communications consolidarity which, it is speculated, is one of the Designer's original intents and goals for the entire phone ship. Obviously, all forms of sound communications can be introduced into the overall phone systems, and a musical piece is sometimes aired over the network through which the celestial choruses can sing, 'The Sweetest Sounds I'11 Ever Hear Are Waiting To Be Heard", one of the favorite cosmic tunes.

Head sets can be Adjusted so that one can remain attuned to the cosmic broadcasts of the communications systems, but these head sets fit over only one ear, and subscribers learn to function with receivership of celestial and planetary information. The improvement in function is marked and this motivates some subscribers to encourage their associates to have their own headsets Adjusted. Adjusted head-sets can also be used, walky-talky fashion, to communicate with other subscribers in relatively short-range transmission and reception. This capacity of the transmitters and receivers can become so “modernized” as to make intra-short-distance dialing. As this increases the overall phone ship capacity of the individual, the Designer has sent to such a communicator the phone books of neighbouring cosmic areas on microfilm. because a printed-out phonebook would be so heavy that a client would be unable to move it, nor even turn its tremendous pages.

The phone ship is currently having this micro-film technology replaced by voice operated service systems which can provide directory assistance upon vocal command by any client.

The phone-function is continuously improving and now even the evidence and record of malfunctions owing to local cosmic disruptions in the communications network are being positively utilized in the actualization of an ever-more-effective universe network of near-instantaneous communications capabilities.

All appreciation and hamage for the supreme effectiveness of the assembling cosmic phone system can be forwarded to the First and Central Caller of All Universal Sectors of Telephonics.

Send not to know for wham the phone rings ...

it rings for us!

From: That Monthly Message of Inspiration, April 1988 




## Farewell Dear Henry

On January 3rd, this year, Henry Begemann said his final farewell to Urantia. Henry, who resided in The Netherlands, was a leading figure in the URANTIA movement in Europe.

He worked on the Dutch translation of _The URANTIA Book_ for, many years as leader of a team of three, and the greater part has been finished. It will be continued by the other members now that Henry has been promoted to the mansion worlds.

He was also the driving force behind the birth of the French newsletter “La Lettre” in 1978, to establish a link between French readers. At about the same time the C.E.R.D.H. was founded (Center of Study and Reflection on Human Destiny) which Henry was also involved with.

In August 1982, while he was a Field Representative (for Europe) of the URANTIA Brotherhood, Henry decided to have corrections made to the French translation of Jacques Weiss. That's why he put three readers in touch with each other who did not know each other before, a bilingual person from Brussels, Belgium, an English teacher from Avignon and a third person from Paris. Henry worked with this team for a year to start them on their way. This correction came to an end in July 1989. Printing now depends on the Foundation.

In Holland he was the leader of six study groups, and members have now started their own groups.

In England also, Henry gave encouragement to readers and a few groups are now meeting regularly.

In Sept/Oct 1986 Six-0-Six published his article ‘Springtime’, which first appeared in ‘La Lettre’, Summer 1985. It was a study on what _The URANTIA Book_ has to say about the relatively near future. Henry called it ‘Springtime’ because of Jesus' words on UB 176:2.6

> “But you should be wise regarding the ripening of an age; you should be alert to discern the sign of the times. You know when the fig tree shows its tender branches and puts forth its leaves that summer is near.Likewise, when the world has passed through the long winter of material-mindedness and you discern the coming of the spiritual springtime of a new dispensation, should you know that the summertime of a new visitation draws near.” [UB 176:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_6)

Henry's final sentence in that article was:

“Be of good cheer, it is springtime already.”

He will be sadly missed by the many people who loved and respected him.

## In Remembrance Of Henry Begemann

When we lived in Holland Wolgang and 1 had the privilege of meeting Henry Begemann and being regular members of his first, very special study group.

Special, mainly because of Henry, whose enthusiasm and driving force to come to grips with the immensity of _The URANTIA Book_, was an inspiration to us, and to all who met him.

He saw his main task in translating the Book into Dutch to make it accessible for a large number of people, which cause he furthered, later in a team, to almost completion.

We feel blessed to know him and we wish him a thrilling journey on his path inward.
