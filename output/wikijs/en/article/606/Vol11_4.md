## A Note From Six-O-Six

From now on we'll just be called Six-O-Six. As you can see we've had a bit of a face-lift this year. With Neil Francey, Tony Rudd and yours truly, we have a great working team! But we still need all you folks to write to us. So keep those letters and articles coming!

So far 14 people have registered for our Melbourne conference. If you haven't sent your registration form in yet, we like to remind you that they should be in by August 3.

**Madeline**

## Melbourne Conference Register By August 3!

Registrations for our Australian Meeting of URANTIA Book Readers, to be held on Melbourne Cup weekend, Saturday November 3 — Tuesday November 6, will close on August 3.

For more information and details see the March/ April Newsletter. If you have lost or would like another copy of the registration form write to Six-O-Six or ring Madeline on (03) 5616089.

If you have been to these Meetings/Conferences before, be hopeful for our efforts in trying to evolve a conference that keeps the features that you seem to want plus some freshness in content, format, venue and activities. If you have not been before, I hope that you can talk to someone who has attended — that is why I first came two years ago. I assure you that you are welcome whether you have studied _The URANTIA Book_ in great depth, or have hardly read the book at all; whether you are a regular study group member, or have very little contact with other readers; whether you have had the book for many years or have only just heard of it; whether you have read any of the book — or even want to or feel able to; whether you can lead a presentation or just want to listen. I've actually met all these kinds of people at recent conferences.

Melbourne Cup weekend was chosen because it is a similar time of year to recent conferences, because it is a lovely season in Melbourne (!) and to encourage Melbourne and Victorian people to attend over their long weekend. Warburton East was chosen because it is beautiful, and close to Melbourne. Arrabri Lodge was chosen for basic facilities comparable to recent conferences, and because of its beautiful natural setting and 12 acres of on-site recreational amenities — including swimming pool, tennis court, trampoline, mini-golf, ropes course, flying fox, archery, sensory / fitness / nature / nocturnal trails, orienteering, games oval, volley ball, cricket, football, moonball, farm activities, animal feeding, weather recording, BBQ garden eating area, campfire facilities, art / craft areas, bush cooking, bush craft, yabbying, fishing, gold panning, bush / river walks, and forest hikes.

People told me they liked recent conferences because of the “atmosphere”, because of the friendship and fellowship, because of the stimulation of the presentations and discussions — both formal and informal, and because the venues were beautiful. So really the conference depends mainly on the warmth and friendliness of those attending. If you have any doubts about coming, I invite you to trust the welcome you will receive for the whole four days, and to trust those who are committed to preparing a quality weekend. You can ring me on (03) 579-4499

## From Our Mailbox

Dear Six-O-Six

Greetings from the Auckland study group to all the folks of 6-0-6. Thank you very much for the copy of your Tenth Anniversary Special Edition. I just read it all from cover to cover and found it quite fascinating. It's a really good reflection of the spread of the Book in Australia and the great diversity of people's reaction to and interpretation of it.

I was particular interested to see a reference to C.U.B.S. I had seen that mentioned several times in the Special Report from the Foundation and l$ had wondered what the letters stood for.

We are all doing fine over here, meeting regularly once a fortnight at Neville & Trish Twist's home and, I hope, growing in the Spirit. Our group has grown by one, which is really great, as we had remained fairly static in numbers for 3 years, and seemed years away from fostering thousands of study groups!

Actually, it's quite amazing how one new member, who fits in well with the others, can add such a new dimension to our discussions.

We have been following the developments in the States with great interest and no little sadness. It seems a great tragedy that this has happened, but the Father's plan for our planet will undoubtedly continue on regardless.

At the moment it doesn't seem as though any of us will be able to come to your conference in November, though we would all really like to. I would love to meet all of you again. We feel quite isolated here at times. Oh well, perhaps the way will be made clear.

Thanks once again, and please convey our warmest greetings to all of you across the Tasman. Love and best wishes,

**Marian Steward**
**Auckland, New Zealand**

Dear Six-O-Six,

Thank you so very much for sending me a copy of your Tenth Anniversary Edition. I enjoyed every bit of it! It must be something in line with Rodan's suggestion for happiness: “Keep an inner gallery of one's special moments.” 6-0-6 is indeed an international, a global forum and who can say what the next ten years hold in store for those who pursue the Father's will and discover him in each other. Thank you very much. Love

## News & Notes

### From Florida

At a conference in May, the Florida study groups decided to not affiliate with either the Fifth Epochal Fellowship or URANTIA Foundation at this time because of divided sentiments regarding the two organizations. The Florida groups decided instead to form an independent organization called Florida Students of _The URANTIA Book_.

### From Seattle

The Familist Fellowship is a new socialization of the religion embodied in _The URANTIA Book_. And it is having an exciting beginning right here in the Northwest with the formation of the “Familist Meeting of Seattle”. The term “Familism” may sound like something you should have removed by your doctor, but you'll get used to it.

What a pleasure it is for me to participate in group worship in an environment — especially for a URANTIA Book reader/believer — where there is no need to filter the ideas for the truth; no need to make any mental or spiritual compromises with the content of the service. This truly feels like wholesome, healthy, spiritual nourishment, such as I have only felt before at URANTIA conferences.

This beginning is the fruit of years of work by Marvin Gawryn. He has outlined the principles and organization of The Familist Fellowship in draft manuscripts which are projected to develop into a multiple volume work, “Foundations of Familism”. In these writings are described “The Familist Way”.

“At the heart of Familism lies the fundamental truth that family is the master pattern of all personal relationships in Creation”.

“Familists aspire to an actual way of living which centers around seven essential truths or qualities of family relationship: the Fatherhood of God, the Brotherhood of Man, the Indwelling Spirit, the Will of God, Love, Eternal Life, and Faith. Familists attempt to live out these truths within the context of five family circles, each of which is a broad arena of service and fellowship: the inner family, the home family, the fellowship family, the family of all believers, and the world-wide family of all God's children”.

It is with this framework that we are beginning to have monthly worship services at the Unity Church of Mountlake Terrace. We have formed a steering committee which is meeting regularly, and other first circle (the inner family) and second circle (the home family) activities may develop soon.

Something to emphasize is that this is being undertaken in a very slow, patient, natural sort of way. We are striving to first of all provide ourselves and our community with spiritual nourishment and spiritual enhancement. There is no formalized way of doing anything. We are open to suggestions and willing to experiment with the form and content of these endeavours.

It is an exciting and humble beginning. If you would like to participate or just know more, write to :

## The Seven Combinations Of Triune Deity

**From: COSMIC REFLECTIONS, Summer/Fall 1990 Vol. 3 No. 2.**

At the risk of being accused of heresy, I would like to suggest that there is something that could improve _The URANTIA Book_. It needs some pictures. Perhaps the authors neglected to include pictures so that we would have the opportunity to exercise our creativity and supply the missing pictures.

As my first contribution, I would like to present the following figure, a symbolic representation of the seven possible combinations of the three persons of the Trinity. Many of you have no doubt seen this as a Trinity symbol in the Christian church.

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia" alt="trinity">
<img src="/image/article/606/trinity.jpg">
<figcaption>The Seven Aspects of Triune Deity</figcaption>
</figure>


The seven combinations of Father, Son, and Spirit are the basis for a number of the combinations of seven found in _The URANTIA Book_. Among these are the seven Master Spirits, and the seven superuniverses. Each Master Spirit and each corresponding superuniverse in some way reflects the nature of one of the seven combinations of the three Gods. Another sevenfold reflection is the case of the sevenfold bestowals of the Creator Sons. We are informed that during Christ Michael's seven bestowals, he revealed the will of all the seven unique combinations, one at a time.

The common area at the centre of the figure can be interpreted in several ways. First, it can be seen as the influence of the three persons, operating as separate persons. Second, it could be seen as the First Triunity (sce page 1148:2) the functional association of the three persons. Third, it could be seen as symbolic of the Trinity, since the centre consists of the three persons so blended that none can be distinguished as separate.

Stay tuned for the next instalment of “_The URANTIA Book_ : Pictures at Last!”

## From E.T. To E-3 <Br> Keeping An Open Mind On The Matter

Some of our readers might have received a letter recently addressed to “My Urantia brothers and sisters” and signed by “E-3 or Elijah the Third”.

I must admit that when I first read this letter and the two pamphlets which were included with it, I thought: “Another nut!”

However, true to the habit which eventually led me to _The URANTIA Book_, the habit of keeping an open mind to new information, no matter where it comes from, I decided to share this letter with the other members of our lunchtime study group. We may or may not have been guided, but we took the decision, after some discussion, to put some money together, purchase “the Graceland tapes” and find out what this “Elijah the Third” had to say.

Once I had listened to the tapes, I asked the members of the Tuesday night study group if they were willing to also be open-minded and share the experience. Although some of them were at first a bit reluctant, to their credit, I must say they all did.

Although these “Graceland tapes” bring some pretty startling information, the whole group of ten agrees that it all makes sense and the longer we think about it, the more we come to believe that it very well could be the truth. Let's imagine for one moment that it is. Would it then be wise to plug up our ears and stick our head in the sand?

On UB 51:2.3 of _The URANTIA Book_, a Secondary Lanonandek Son of the Reserve Corps says:

> “_If some physical catastrophe should doom the planetary residence of an evolving race, the Melchizedeks and the Life Carriers would install the technique of dematerialization for all survivors, and by seraphic transport these beings would be carried away to the new world prepared for their continuing existence. The evolution of a human race, once initiated on a world of space, must proceed quite independently of the physical survival of that planet...._” [UB 51:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/51#p2_3)

Did he put that sentence there just for decoration? Surely not! Working within the limits of his revelatory mandate, that was probably all he was allowed to say on the subject.

But why tell us at all unless he knew that such an evacuation could be in store for this planet?

> “_In the affairs of men's hearts the Universal Father may not always have his way; but in the conduct and destiny of a planet the divine plan prevails; the eternal purpose of wisdom and love triumphs_”. ([UB 3:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/3#p5_3))

On UB 46:8.3 an Archangel of Nebadon says:

> “_But ere long, the adjudication of Lucifer and his associates will restore the Satania system to the Norlatiadek constellation, and subsequently, Urantia and the other isolated spheres will be restored to the Satania circuits, and again will such worlds enjoy the privileges of interplanetary communication and intersystem communion_”. [UB 46:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p8_3)

(Listen to tape 3 — Welcome to the Cosmos.)

In the past, apocalyptic forecasts have instilled fear into the minds of people. But these ‘Graceland tapes’, far from instilling fear, give us hope, that God does not forsake us in our darkest hour. They don't instruct us to walk around in sackcloth and repent, but not to do anything else than what we are already doing, and that is have faith in our Father. Could we, like Job of old, be in for the faith-test supreme? Why did the archangels establish their divisional headquarters here? On page 408 we find:

> “_It is this unusual fact that soon arrests the attention of extra-Nebadon student visitors_”. ([UB 37:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_3))

On the next page (409:1) they ask us:

> “_Do you grasp the significance of the fact that your lowly and confused planet has become a divisional headquarters for the universe administration and direction of certain archangel activities having to do with the Paradise ascension scheme?_” [UB 37:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_4)

Could it be, among other things, for the next roll call and to herald the beginning of a new, the fifth epoch?

> “_Remember that the order of progressive evolution is subjected to sudden and unexpected periodical changes in both the material and the spiritual worlds._” ([UB 170:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_14))

Or could it have to do with “the silence” that tape 3 Welcome to the Cosmos — talks about. This is the period of approximately 27 years when mortal ascenders of 10,000 universe systems will get a chance to visit the bestowal world, Urantia, the world that blew itself up, as the ultimate grim reminder that “The wages of sin is death”.

Elijah the Third says that Urantia will go through a major purging. Taking the state of affairs our world is in, it is not altogether such an unbelievable possibility, is it? Do you ever get the feeling that we need some pretty drastic purging to get us out of the mess we're in? If that is to happen, wouldn't Michael, who is our loving universe father, send somebody to warn us, just like he warned his apostles about the destruction of Jerusalem?

If all this is about to happen, then I would rather be warned about it. What a blunder on our part it would be to have been warned but not to have listened.

> All I Can Do Is Put My Hand In My Father's Hand And Trust That His Love For us will win in the end.

And if it doesn't happen, it hasn't hurt me to have listened. For now, I like to keep an open mind on the whole thing and get on with my life.

What do I mean with an open mind? I mean giving a person a fair hearing and feeling humble enough to admit that there are more things between heaven and earth than I know about. Just because certain information doesn't fit into my past experiences or concept frames, doesn't mean it cannot be so.

Should we let an intellectual decision prevent us from giving our spirit a chance to respond at a deeper level?

Don't worry, I've still got my feet firmly planted on the ground, and you can expect your next Six-O-Six in the mail in approximately two months time, full of more stimulating and thought-provoking articles!

All I can do is put my hand in my Father's hand and trust that His love for us will win in the end.

It has been interesting to observe that other readers in Australia had pre-conceived ideas about the tapes as soon as they knew what the subject was and chose to
condemn them as “utter rubbish” before even listening to them. Of course that is their prerogative.

I know that none of the people in our group for one moment regretted having listened to them. They all agreed — it was a beautiful message of faith, hope and love. But then truth is relative. Even if these tapes contain some error, every teacher has some of the truth, none have all of it. Not even _The URANTIA Book_. Isn't revelation always progressive?

So often I have in the past witnessed the frustration of URANTIA Book readers with the attitude of fundamentalists of certain Christian denominations, who, because the Bible says that nothing is to be added, close their minds to the light of new truths. I certainly don't want to turn into a URANTIA Book fundamentalist.

_The URANTIA Book_ for instance says that communications with the dead are not allowed in this dispensation. Yet evidence seems to be piling up that messages are being send from the beyond. In cases like that I just like to keep an open mind on the matter. Maybe we've moved into a new dispensation where it is allowed. Who knows?

I have asked permission from Elijah Ministry to copy the pamphlets, which are included with this issue of Six-O-Six (Australian readers only).

If any of our readers decide to order the tapes from Elijah Ministry, Six-O-Six would be interested to hear your opinion after having listened to them. The information is startling enough to grant it some space in our newsletter, I feel. True to its reputation of showing neither fear nor favour, Six-O-Six would like to throw this open to discussion, even though only one other newsletter, amongst the ones that I receive, has chosen to mention it so far. Dick Bain gives some comments in the Summer/Fall 1990 issue of “COSMIC REFLECTIONS” and he obviously had not listened to the tapes.

He is inadvertently confirming Elijah the Third to be a real prophet when he says: “When a real prophet comes, he or she will not appeal to our fear, but rather to our faith. This prophet will not exhort us to prepare for Armageddon, but rather to establish a faith relationship with our spiritual Father, and to be in brotherhood with all of our spiritual brothers and sisters, just as Jesus did. And the Spirit of Truth will testify to our spirits — 'This is a true and faithful son of God.”

Had he listened he would have realized that E-3 is doing just that.

However, Dick has a valid point when he says: “Yes, the prophets of doom could do some harm. People outside of the URANTIA movement could get the idea that this is what the book and the movement are all about. It would be very unfortunate if misrepresentations of the book or the movement were aired by the media. Also, new students of the book could become confused about what the book really teaches.”

E-3 denies he is a prophet of doom. On his first introductory tape — ‘A Message From God’ — Elijah says: “I'm only the messenger of divine insight. The job of this prophet is to bring certainty and inner confidence despite this very uncertain and upset world.” In his book 'The End of the World! and the Coming Bestowal Son', published in 1986, Joe Pope wrote: “The only readers who see the end of the world as a ”negative“ concept are those who are so materialistic that they can't see the far better earth that emerges from this cosmic metamorphosing cocoon.”

> “He who does not dare to look at an ‘untruth’, also cannot see the truth”.

What happened between the time in 1986 when Joe Pope published his book and 1990, when as Elijah the Third he came forth as the prophet of ‘The End Times’? I do realize that anyone can dig up quotes from _The URANTIA Book_ or the Bible to back up the point he is trying to make, and that likewise others will be able to find quotes to contradict it.

With God all things are possible. Look what happened to Paul of Tarsus on the way to Damascus. Did Joe really have a genuine vision? Is he bringing a new revelation? We will all have to decide that for ourselves. There is a Persian proverb that goes something like this: “He who does not dare to look at an ‘untruth’, also cannot see the truth”.

> “_Jesus had an unerring ability for the recognition of truth, and truth he never hesitated to embrace, no matter from what source it appeared to emanate._” ([UB 126:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_8))

On [UB 170:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_19) it is mentioned that “_Sooner or later another and greater John the Baptist is due to arise ...._”

When he comes, how are we going to recognise him? Are we in the true Urantia fashion going to stone him to death, throw him in front of the lions, crucify him or just shoot him down before we even have heard what he has to say? If we are to determine whether this is a genuine prophet or a “mind at mischief” as Dr Sadler called it, shouldn't we check him out first? Or have people cried “wolf” once too often?

It is understandable that after Vern Grimsley, “the prophet of the West” as some call him, people have become very cautious with predictions about the future.

If Elijah the Third is a true prophet, and there are people with that God-given gift, he will prove himself, for he won't seek self- aggrandizement, but will be a true server in the Father's kingdom. If not, then time will expose him as a fraud. We haven't got long to wait.

In 1986 Joe Pope, alias Elijah the Third, was very aware of the risks he was taking by predicting a date, for he wrote; “The only problem with ”When?" is that it's a minefield! Throughout the last two thousand years more people's evangelistic careers and reputations have been shattered on the anvil of having predicted a precise date for the end of the world, when the hammer of that day came down.

To use another metaphor, I intend to do nothing but just barely touch my toes into this troubled water of picking a date for the eschaton."

One cannot deny that his message is very compelling. One person, who is not a URANTIA Book reader, wrote to me after listening to the introductory tape ‘A Message from God’: “I must tell you that at no time did I feel fear, scepticism nor doubt, and in my conversation with God, I told Him that I would accept whatever He felt I deserved. I believed that God will not judge us for our religious beliefs, but for our faith in Him. So when this was confirmed in the leaflet and the tape, it was very reassuring .... a great peace descended over me .... It is the best news I have ever heard in my whole life, and no amount of reading nor people knocking on my door would have achieved this same result. I feel it is too fantastic not to be true. No human being could ever have made this up. Also the fact that the writer and speaker is not from any particular religion convinces me that it is true. Some of the things I heard fitted in with what you have told me in the past. We have nothing to lose and everything to gain in believing it is true”

> “_Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening and spiritual enlightenment._” ([UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

If the book says that, shouldn't we at least listen? Can we afford not to?

Let's have a closer look at that sentence again.

**‘Urantia’** (that's us, the sentimental shrine of all Nebadon, the name of our universe)

**‘is now’** (written in 1934)

**‘quivering’** (seems to imply trembling with great hopes and expectations)

**‘on the very brink’** (something sudden, a cut-off point)

**‘of one of its most amazing’** (evacuation to an emergency planet would certainly be that!)

**‘and enthralling epochs’** (the dictionary defines ‘enthral’ as to hold spellbound, enchant, captivate)

**‘of social readjustment’** (listen to tape 2 ‘This Is The Life’)

**‘moral quickening’** (it certainly would make us pull up our socks!)

**‘and spiritual enlightenment’** (no half measures this time!)

I cannot help but get the feeling that the Midwayers who wrote this (remember they are permanent residents here) are pretty excited about some future event not too far away. They're not exactly saying: “Sit down guys and have another cup of tea while you're waiting,” are they?

Albert Einstein once said: “A man of true learning gains something from every encounter he has, but the sceptic remains ignorant for all time”. Which would you rather be?

I'm not asking anyone to believe all this. All I'm saying is, keep an open mind and let the Spirit of Truth do its own work.

## International Conference

The International Conference of the Fifth Epochal Fellowship (formerly URANTIA Brotherhood) was held at Snowmass, Colorado, USA, from 30th June to 5th July. Five Australians and one New Zealander were among more than 1,000 attendees of a well organised and stimulating five days of presentations, workshops, entertainment and socialising. This was the second conference at Snowmass, the first being in 1981, and the facilities were superb.

Each day began with a session which included the entire conference, followed by a break-up into smaller groups for morning and afternoon workshops. Meals were taken communally under a huge tarpaulin erected on the roof of the conference building. There was a large variety of activities and entertainments to choose from, including riding, cycling, white-water rafting, shopping excursions, sightseeing excursions and mountain walks, while evening activities included music and dancing at “Club U.B.”, a concert at which John Denver sang, and a performance of “The Power Within”, a musical created by readers in Oklahoma City, and in particular Susan Wright Aldridge and Larry Mullens. An evening of square dancing was also arranged.

The nationalities represented, apart from USA were Australia, Canada, Estonia, France, Finland, New Zealand, South Africa, Switzerland and Tahiti. The Canadian contingent was by far the largest, but Australians who attended the Robertson conference in 1988 will remember Dexter and Brigitte Cave from Tahiti, and Urs and Nicole Ruchti from Switzerland. Urs delighted the entire conference with a program of Chopin played on a somewhat superior piano to the one he had to use at Robertson. Musical interludes occurred frequently throughout the conference, and the quality was high, particular some of the choral arrangements.

Workshops varied enormously, and one person could attend only a small proportion of the offering. Because of the great variety it is quite impossible for me to categorise them in any accurate way. Suffice it to say that there were many conducted at a very high level, and a great many diverse points of view received attention. Because of the large contingent from Canada, several of the presentations were made by Canadians, most notably those connected with the newly chartered Couchiching URANTIA Society of Ontario. In fact, I would estimate that the Americans have made considerable progress in internationalising the revelation since the Maine Conference in 1987.

There continues to be a remarkable interest in Australia, and the chartering of societies in Finland and Canada in the last couple of years has definitely focused the attention of Americans on non-American readers of the book.

Although the organisers of the conference did not wish to emphasise the consequences of the rift with URANTIA Foundation, clearly these matters were uppermost in the minds of many who attended the conference. I spoke to as many people as I could about it to try to ascertain what the general view was. I also spoke at length with some of the office holders of the Fifth Epochal Fellowship, and was granted an interview by the President of URANTIA Foundation in Chicago before the conference.

There is no doubt in my mind that the problems are real. They have a long history extending back 15 or so years, and the fact that wishful thinking and poor judgement postponed their early correction has compounded the difficulties to the extent that a total break between the two organizations was inevitable. There have been mistakes on both sides. However, I must make it clear that in my judgement the motives of the leading office holders of Fifth Epochal Fellowship remain unsullied. I am unable to detect in them the power hunger, the meanness of spirit or the malice of which they have been accused. They have made mistakes, and they admit it. But it is also my judgement that the URANTIA Foundation is no longer prepared to co-operate with the Fifth Epochal Fellowship, which can thus no longer be regarded as simply the URANTIA Brotherhood under a new name. Indeed, the President of URANTIA Foundation made it clear to me that he would not co-operate with anyone who retained close ties with the Fifth Epochal Fellowship, although he did concede that the whole question was really an American affair, and that non-Americans really have no part to play.

My recommendation is that we Australians should keep out of it, refrain from taking sides, and allow time to settle the issue. We have no real constructive role to play. Formal affiliations are clearly not appropriate under the current state of affairs. We have plenty to do in extending the readership, encouraging study group formation and sustaining our own growth. The Americans will sort out their own difficulties in due course.

The president of URANTIA Foundation has agreed to look into our problems of book distribution and new readership referral, and mentioned that he had plans in place to address both issues. However, he refused to provide me with details, so I am unable to pass on to Australian readers anything of substance in these areas.

On the whole, I have had an instructive, and at times astonishing, visit with American readers. I remain hopeful that Australian readers can avoid becoming embroiled in the American organizational troubles. I am impressed with the progress made by American readers in their recognition and understanding of non-American students of the book. And I conclude that the Fifth Epochal Revelation continues to expand and fulfil its mission in spite of the follies and frailties of the humans entrusted with it.

## The Vagaries Of Proof A Reply To Tony Rudd

In an interesting letter in the May/June 6-0-6, Tony Rudd brought up the question of proof, giving an example in which he compared the racialism of Hitler and the Nazis with apparent racialism in _The URANTIA Book_ and concluding that Hitler was on the right track in his efforts to breed a super race of Aryans along the lines of the Adamic program to promote the violet race. I was glad to see Tony's acknowledgement that his conclusions were clearly ridiculous, but this impasse does bring up the vexing question of the precise nature of proof.

The problem is an ancient one, but perhaps more understanding has been gleaned in the last century than during the previous several thousand years. However the quite remarkable work that has accumulated is almost all couched in the obscure language of logicians, in particular mathematical logicians, and since most of us do not like their conclusions anyhow, very little of the results of their work has penetrated even into academic circles. Some of the important names in this outstanding effort are Hilbert, Frege, Russell, Whitehead, Zermelo and Fraenkel, Cantor, Godel, Shannon, and Cohen — and probably many others.

A great deal of the work by these logicians has been concerned with the development of a formalized language that is both precise and adequate for the expression of any mathematical concept. The importance of their work for science is obvious, because mathematics is the very basis of all science and much else besides. However, the results of their work have been devastating for our aspirations to attain to an absolute knowledge of the universe.

The first major crack in what appeared to be watertight sets of axioms basic to mathematics came from the work of Kurt Godel in 1930, who showed that for any consistent axiomatic theory that was adequate to describe elementary arithmetic there will always be statements that can neither be proved nor disproved from its axioms (First Incompleteness Theorem). Worse still Godel's Second Incompleteness Theorem showed that the notion of consistency is destined to remain forever elusive.

After the initial shock, academia settled down to sweep Godel under the carpet by promoting the notion that incompleteness did not affect ‘real’ problems, and support for this view came when Cantor was able to formulate a very general mathematical framework of set theory that appeared to serve as a foundation for all mathematics. Russell put a fly in the balm by asking embarrassing questions about the set of all sets, but a new Godelian type of catastrophe did not come until 1963 when Paul Cohen did to set theory what Godel had done to the earlier axiomatic systems. No recovery has since been made from the second shock wave, and Cohen's initial discovery has been followed by the application of his method (method of forcing) to show the undecidability of a great many classical unsolved problems of mathematics. It is now generally agreed that the illness is terminal.

Undoubtedly this exposition is boring to many, probably most, readers. However it is not necessary to digest its content other than to recognize that even the finest mathematical and logical brains among us have not been able to provide rigorous proof of even the axioms of simple arithmetic. Hence the lesson for all of us is that we are exceedingly naive about what constitutes proof, and we very much need to hone our critical faculties in regard to what we accept as fact, or the opinions we promote to others as conclusively proven facts — a point which Tony's letter has made a compelling appeal. _The URANTIA Book_ has provided us with much wisdom on this topic. The papers arrived at a time when our mathematicians considered that their discipline was the most rigorous of all, but Paper 103 gave scant heed to their pride by referring to ‘the approximations of mathematics’. The same Paper tells us that,

> “_In the mortal state, ***nothing*** can be absolutely proved, both science and religion are predicated on assumptions. On the morontia level, the postulates of both science and religion are capable of partial proof by mota logic (elsewhere we are told that mota logic is beyond comprehension). On the spiritual level of maximum status, the need for finite proof gradually vanishes before the actual experience of and with reality; but even then there is much beyond the finite that remains unproved_”. [UB 103:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_10)

This Paper also reminds us of our need for searching and fearless self-criticism, and a greater awareness of the incompleteness and evolutionary status of our knowledge. It also makes the comment that we are often too self-confident and dogmatic.

We might note from the above quote that both science and religion are ‘predicated on assumptions’ which, though sometimes almost infinitely less rigorous, are nevertheless kin to the axioms of mathematical logic. Behind any opinion that we put forward, there is always a set of unstated assumptions (axioms) upon which the validity of our opinion is dependent. The recognition by Tony of the ridiculousness of his 'conclusive proof that the racial policies stated by Hitler in 'Mein Kamp? were a forerunner of the truths of _The URANTIA Book_ is perhaps due to his own appreciation that there were different sets of ‘axioms’ underlying the racial policies by Hitler and those proposed in _The URANTIA Book_.

The brain behind Hitler's concept of the master race was that of his own favourite philosopher, Friedrich Nietzsche. Here is a sample of Nietzsche's writings: “The will for power is will for mastery, and the most important mastery is that of man over man. The will for power knows no bonds which prescribe what is permitted; for it, everything is good which springs from power and increases power; everything is bad which springs from weakness and weakens power. All the brutality of trampling down those who may be in the way, all the unfettering of the primitive beast in human nature, are the right and duty of the strong.” From this kind of assumption sprang the atrocities of the concentration camps, and the brutal extermination of millions upon millions of ‘inferior’ people. In contrast stand the assumptions behind the racial policies of Michael that will eventually herald in the age of light and life on Urantia. The philosophy behind these assumptions may be gleaned from Michael's ordination sermon to the twelve ([Paper 104](/en/The_Urantia_Book/104)), described in _The URANTIA Book_ as 'a master philosophy of life'. Here we may perceive a vastly different set of assumptions based not on might and power, but on service, selflessness, and love — concepts labelled by Nietzsche as weakness, hence despicable.

_The URANTIA Book_ claims to be the Fifth Epochal Revelation. It is up to us as individuals to assess our own attitude to that claim. I, personally, accept it without reservation. However even those who do likewise must still differentiate between those parts of the book that are authoritative revelation and other parts that have been given to us to help coordinate our present endowment of knowledge, which is, of course, somewhat elementary and partial.

Much of the science component of the book is merely a coordinating statement of the status of scientific knowledge as it stood in the early 1930's and much of the science that we find in the book has since been superceded. Some, however, is both prophetic and extraordinary. _The URANTIA Book_ does not specifically differentiate its revelatory passages, and it is incumbent upon us, as individuals, to recognize revelatory authority when we see it. For example, when the book attributes Michael himself, the statement that our souls have not had previous existences, I cannot conceive how I can do other than accept it as revelatory knowledge. Hence I, personally, must accept it as such or else I must reject the claim of the book to be revelatory. In such an instance, proof is not involved. But though I can find a thousand or more intellectual arguments to support the revelatory claim of the book, in the final analysis, acceptance is not dependent upon that elusive entity we have termed 'proof but it is an act of faith contingent upon my personal experience of the God who is my Father, and his Son who is my Creator and my Master — and yet also my brother.

_The URANTIA Book_ informs us that we all have the necessary gifts to lift us above and beyond the confusion of our materialistically-dominated thought processes because of certain inherent assumptions that are integrated into the human mind as gifted to us via the mind circuits of the Infinite Spirit. From the adjutant mind spirits, we humans receive the inherent knowledge that:

1. “Reason is valid — the universe can be comprehended.”
2. “Wisdom is valid — the material universe can be coordinated with the spiritual.” And from the Thought Adjuster, we receive the inherent knowledge that:
3. “Faith is valid — God can be known and attained” ([UB 103:9.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_8)).

Again this is revelation, proof is irrelevant. Our willingness to accept these gifts and to believe them has the direct result that we live lives motivated by truth and dominated by love ([UB 103:9.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p9_9)). And this is the personal journey that Tony has referred to at the conclusion of his absorbing letter.

## Queensland Meeting To Study Jesus' Teachings To The Apostles

Imagine focusing on the highest teachings of the greatest teacher as contained in the most authoritative guide to the mortal race.

A small group, in a bushland setting near Nambour, spent three days in late June 1990 doing just that. It was a dynamic, yet informal and open discussion on the mind of Jesus. We considered ourselves apprentice apostles, for indeed that was the theme of our papers.

The material for discussion was categorized from the spoken words of Jesus as presented by the Midwayer Commission in Part IV of _The URANTIA Book_.

We rationalized that only by knowing his teachings can we hope to know his mind. And only then can we apply the mind of Jesus, which will always serve us well, in the decisions of our daily lives.

We discovered repeated reference to three concepts: service, the will of God, and perfection. The striving for these results in spiritual progress, the measure of which is revealed in our love for our fellow man. (The dual Fatherhood/Brotherhood concept)

We further learnt we need to be out in the world and activity doing His will. This demonstrates to others as well as ourselves that we live by faith in God and are solely dependent on Jesus' teachings, not on a controlled environment with unnecessary material benefits. We are called upon to bear the fruits of the spirit. The ‘fruits’ are:

> “_loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace._” ([UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2))

A report cannot capture the feeling accumulated from these days of happy discussion on some twenty pages of teachings. We could not help but become more intimately acquainted with the nature and personality of God as revealed by Jesus. The seminar material is available upon request from: Anne Bendall, PO Box 839, Nambour, QLD. 4560.

While recommended for private study, it has proved particularly worthwhile for group discussion. In addition to these ‘Apprentice Apostleship’ papers, another four categories compiled from the quoted words of Jesus, are also available. These papers are entitled: Spirit of Truth, Philosophy, General, and Service.

## Are You Lonesome Tonight?

Well, sit down, open up your heart and pour it all out to Michael! Open up the channel to his Spirit of Truth and he can act as he desires, as the most sympathetic, empathetic friend you have in the universe, and he knows what it is all about so the two of you can compare notes.

There has never walked this earth and there never will walk this planet another individual who has experienced the loneliness and shattering of every conceivable dream than Jesus. Every other planet in his local universe benefited from his bestowal, but potentially, none so much as ours.

As a result we are released of all the deleterious effects of being quarantined, all the damage done by the Caligastia rebellion and the Adamic default. That is, providing we wish to take advantage of The Spirit of Truth. All the revelators refer to The Spirit of Truth as an impersonal channel; it is carefully explained that it does not provide a one-to-one communication link; that is everyone, except Jesus. He refers to it as “he”. Note whenever he refers to the coming of the Spirit of Truth of “myself and my Father” he unfailingly says and “when he comes” and “he” will do this and that!

Michael regards the Spirit of Truth in very personal terms. And in reading the Blue Book, it is a wondrous source of information that we have been blessed with, for amongst so many abilities it links us with the creator of this universe who has walked, every inch of the pathway we will ever traverse, before us. Michael knows the power of fear, the danger of pride. He worked with people , trying to help them overcome these characteristics. He knows all about lost dreams, the trauma of all plans being shattered in a split second of tragedy. He knows what it is like to plan to buy a little farm as an idyllic lifestyle in which to rear his family, and have the funds wrongfully refused by a “fox”. He also knows the pleasure of cuddling and playing with a puppy dog (as soon as finances permitted, the Nazareth family purchased a dog).

He knows what duty and responsibility are all about, and how, at times, we are confronted with conflict in being torn between two loves. He knows the power of persuasion of a human love, and the extreme battle in opting for God's will, and the attendant sadness at the eventuation of the anticipated rejection. He knows the hurt of injustice plus incredible sadness, on the human level.

Recall the night in Gethsemane, read of his hours before the crucifixion; the sadness before going on his last important preaching tour — no one will ever endure what he endured as part of his life in human flesh. And yet, so many of us sadden him by not taking his proffered hand in our periods of loneliness. How that must hurt him!

Loneliness has been defined as a negative state experienced when there is a discrepancy between an individual's desired and achieved interpersonal relationships.

There are two types — emotional loneliness which is related to the lack of close, intimate attachment to another person; and social loneliness which results from lack of friendship with people who share common interests and activities.

Providing we do not have any low self-esteem problems in believing we are unlovable, social loneliness is overcome by seeking groups and clubs with likeminded people. And so with us URANTIA Book readers we mix with fellow readers and form study groups which help overcome our feeling of social isolation as people with strongly held beliefs and faith. Study groups can also be of assistance to our spiritual growth, depending upon our group interaction and the aspirations of each of the members of the group.

But emotional loneliness is beyond our control to satisfy, for it requires the decision of another person; and this is where Michael is at his most understanding, for it appears to me practically all of the sadness he experienced to the point of crying, was associated with this loneliness. There was no human being whom he could pour out his heart to, no one who could listen and understand. Great lover as he is, he refused to marry, for he knew the intolerable grief that Rebecca would experience. He had the opportunity and refused in the purity of his boundless, unselfish heart.

And for some of us today, we are not presented with the opportunity of a loving companion, someone to share our tears and laughter with. The Blue Book tells us of God's plan, that man and woman are not meant to be alone. We totally agree with God, but where is our mate? For my part I went through a dreadful state whilst I felt incomplete without a partner. I would be alone and my laughter would echo and unnerve me; I felt that God maybe thought no man was safe near me, that a little more socialization may have to be undertaken, a few more edges knocked of my rugged individuality, and at times, I would cry to Him to speed up the process. Every poor unsuspecting man who stumbled across my pathway was put under the microscope of my need. I had no check list, no essential attributes, and seeing I loved him before I met him, as I do all my brothers and sisters, and as I also had the delightfully simplistic philosophy of “love conquers all”, I was on the pathway to disaster.

And then one day, I grew a little, and sadly left behind my illusions. I was wrong for I felt that life was incomplete without a mate, that I needed a companion by my side. And I do not, for in any situation God provides me with all that's necessary. He may also want to provide me with a few non-essentials, but when it comes to a mate, all He can do is, assuming we are both responsive to guidance, put the right people in the right place at the right time, and let their free will do the rest.

I read the chapters of the Blue Book on the benefits of a partnership; how men and women can and do complement each other, all the advantages of companionship, and know one day I will experience this, but what does it matter if it is not until the mansion worlds, Uversa or Paradise? God has promised that none of us will reach Paradise with a sense of deprivation. Those of our heart's desire, in accordance with His wish (and relationships of a twosome nature are most definitely His plan) will be enjoyed to the full by all of us, if not on Urantia, then at some point in our ascension career.

Life is no longer sad, now I accept reality. I think of Grandfanda; he made the trip to Paradise alone. There was no Mrs. Grandfanda accompanying him. Maybe she flunked the last leg of the trip and had to sit the exam once again, in which instance they would be reunited on her successful second attempt. But maybe, Grandfanda did the whole trip alone, apart from seraphim, guides, well wishers, pupils and teachers!

Michael has promised that none of us will ever experience personality isolation if we turn to him, and although the warnings about the dangers of such a state in the book are potentially real, if God cannot organize for human companionship because humans refuse to come close to anyone of us, then God and Michael will fill in the personality interaction gap. Their promise!

Marriage — what is the ideal in this local universe? When I get to the mansion worlds I am sure that there will be a video of the “jubilee of jubilees” as described on pg. 368 and I am going to watch that emotional show again and again, with the romance and beauty of the ceremony never failing to bring tears to my eyes. I often wonder at the intensity of the suffering of our Divine Minister as she followed Michael's last bestowal. What a homecoming! and what a wonderful marriage ceremony!

Next time you feel really lonely, and have no one to talk to, remember that, although there is no substitute for the loving companionship of another creature of our own kind, that Michael knows the feeling, and he also knows our personal loneliness and let he and your T.A. lovingly guide you through the period in the knowledge that to him/her who experiences deprivation beyond God's control at this point in time, that person has the blessed experience of contrast so that when companionship finally is yours, how more treasured it will be because of the life of walking the pathway alone, in the seen sense.
