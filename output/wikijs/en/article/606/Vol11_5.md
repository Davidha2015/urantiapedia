## “Thought for the month” 

> “_...in all ordinary circumstances, it would be far better to placate the wrath of unbelievers that you might live and continue to preach the glad tidings._” ([UB 181:2.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_15))

## From Our Mailbox

Dear Six-O-Six,

In response to the article, in the July/August issue of Six-O-Six, I would like to pose the following questions.

1\. Michael advises us that if we wish to be led by his Spirit of Truth, we will be guided into all knowledge of him, God and all truth. It will take a long time, as we apparently do not succeed in de-materializing our image of God until we get to Uversa, but why is it that the prophets of the twentieth century still see God as those of the pre-Jesus era?

Why must they hold a view of God contrary to that which Jesus held? Why do they insist on seeing God as wrathful, vengeful, running out of patience, taking back His power to judge which zillions of years ago, He handed over to the Universal courts, decreeing, at the same time, that judgment was never to be executed by one individual?

Why must they see God as breaking the Universal law which He holds inviolate, and demands adherence to by every individual — respect for the free will of every universe personality?

Why cannot the 'prophets' see God as Jesus did. As our loving Father, who, at times chastens us for our own good, but always as a loving Father?

2\. What is there in us that gets our adrenaline flowing at the thought of Urantia being blown up? What's wrong with this planet? I am decidedly biased where Urantia is concerned; I consider it the most beautiful planet in the universe, at this point in time; this opinion being totally biased by the fact that it is the only one I know.

I will categorically state — Urantia is not going to be blown up, it is going to progress nicely onto light and life, and Jesus' statement of FACT will become reality, as the gospel that he preached WILL RULE THIS VERY WORLD.

3\. Urantia may have been “quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment” (2082:7) at the time of the revelatory commission compiling the papers, but now this planet is right over the edge and firmly involved with social readjustment, moral quickening and spiritual enlightenment. Of this FACT I have not the slightest doubt. Finally, after a long, long time, people are opening their heart so that Michael's Spirit of Truth can pour in. Those who are the prophets of a nuclear holocaust are living twenty years ago, and are gaining their information on this world second or third hand. To them, with respect, I would suggest that they get out on the streets and mix with the common folk, and they will witness, first hand, the miracle of Jesus in action.

Our civilization is producing folks of the calibre of Martin Luther King and Mother Theresa. That is no mean feat for a planet with our past history. Those who are exemplary of Jesus' sojourn on Urantia effectively negating all deleterious aftereffects of the Caligastia rebellion and the Adamic default.

It is a shame that, whilst a goodly amount of time, effort and money is being spent by social psychologists trying to discover what qualities are needed to be a Mother Theresa, those of our civilization who espouse total dedication to their own spiritual progress are not pursuing the same intellectual endeavour.

I have not listened to the E-3 tapes, but can only assume that the prophesy is in the nature of a promise to all those who are not ready for the mansion worlds, that God is giving them a further opportunity to grow by creating a half way house, whilst those who have chosen survival will be blown off this planet straight to the mansion world assembly halls; or left here on a decimated planet to help those victims still alive, where they will have a wondrous opportunity to experience chronic sensory and material deprivation, which will provide nonduplicable ground, anywhere in the universe, for invaluable catalysts for growth. Just imagine the pleasure in arriving on the mansion worlds if we had experienced a period on a planet which had a nuclear holocaust!!

In deliberating such fancies of the mind, I ask you to remember that this planet is the property of Michael. We have total say where our survival is concerned; as stewards of material assets, we may be called to account as to our dealings with that entrusted to us, but their are too many overviewers reading our fickle little minds to permit us to irretrievably destroy that which is not ours by proprietary right — the planet on which we live.

I pray for the day when there are millions, maybe billions of URANTIA Book fundamentalists walking this planet, all living examples of the one COMMANDMENT Jesus gave us — “Love one another as I have loved you”.

_Editor's Note:_

_Dear Ann,_

_My very reason for writing the article was because I was trying to point out that making assumptions is a risky business. You've jumped to the wrong conclusions and because of that arrived at the wrong prophet and the wrong scenario. Optimism is fine as long as it does not turn into self-deception and callousness._

Dear Six-O-Six,

I did so enjoy your response to the Elijah claims. Although I must admit that my first impression was one of scepticism, I do agree with you that one should keep an open mind on the subject. Only time will prove whether his claims are true or false — so in the meantime let's keep an open mind and wait and see what comes of it all.

Dear Six-O-Six,

A URANTIA Book Fundamentalist?

I would like to make some comments on the article written in the July/August issue of 6-0-6 by Madeline Noordzy in relation to Elijah the Third. First up I'd like to say that I have not heard the tapes but the material enclosed on them in 6-0-6 was enough to make me have no intention of listening to them. This then immediately dumps me into the category of those people Madeline mentioned in her article when she said: “It has been interesting to observe that other readers in Australia had pre-conceived ideas about the tapes as soon as they knew what the subject was and chose to condemn them as ”utter rubbish“ before even listening to them.” And then: “So often I have in the past witnessed the frustration of URANTIA Book readers with the attitude of fundamentalists of certain Christian denominations, who, because the Bible says that nothing is to be added, close their minds to the light of new truths. I certainly don't want to turn into a URANTIA Book fundamentalist.”

So I take it that because I choose not to listen to these tapes I am close-minded to truths outside of _The URANTIA Book_, possibly making me no better than a fundamentalist Christian in my narrow attitude to my source of truth.

I feel this implication is unjust and untrue and needs further clarification. I'm actually intrigued by the term ‘URANTIA Book fundamentalist’ because I guess when it all boils down there are certain fundamentals in _The URANTIA Book_. If we embrace it as the Fifth Epochal Revelation, then we use the truths gleaned from it as a yard stick for the recognition of truths coming from other sources. If this is what a URANTIA Book fundamentalist is, then I proudly declare that I am one. Let's take a look at what some of those fundamentals may be:

1. _The URANTIA Book_ is the Fifth Epochal Revelation — meaning the most significant event in the spiritual evolution of mankind since Jesus. Now that's not something to be taken lying down! You either believe it or you don't. I do. Therefore my life revolves around its study and attempting to put its teachings into practice in my life.
2. There is a fragment of God indwelling everyone of us fathering an evolving soul in accordance with our free-will choosing. This makes us potential sons and daughters of God and when we finally fuse with that indwelling fragment, our fate as a son of God is sealed forever.
3. We are evolving beings in a time-space universe. God designed it this way so that he could have beings who have learned and found the glory of God through experiential growth, through struggle and hardship and the joyous realisation of truth through the efforts of our free-will choosing. Whatever job he needs us to perform as perfected experiential beings must be pretty immense for us to have gone through such thorough training.
4. Jesus of Nazareth was the Creator Son of our local universe of Nebadon, incarnated in the likeness of mortal flesh. His life and teachings are the key to the Brotherhood of Man under the Fatherhood of God. Those teachings must be embraced in the hearts of all mortals if we are to achieve Light and Life.
5. The spiritual realities of the Kingdom of Heaven that Jesus spoke of are VALUES that people feel in their lives which are more than temporal — meaning “The Kingdom of Heaven is not of this world”.
6. _The URANTIA Book_ is a means to an end — not an end in itself. Although there were restrictions with this revelation which could mean that some scientific facts may become obsolete in time, there are revelatory truths that will stand for all time. (Ken Glasziou elaborates on this point very well in his article “The Vagaries of Proof” in the July/August issue of 6-0-6.)

I could go on. However that's enough for now to keep me going. A URANTIA Book Fundamentalist? I guess if you stand by the above and are committed to spread the teachings of the book, then you should qualify to be a URANTIA Book Fundamentalist. Doesn't sound too narrow-minded to me.

I understand that _The URANTIA Book_ does not contain all truth but it has given us plenty that is relevant to our stage of development to keep us going for a long time. If it says in _The URANTIA Book_ that the dead cannot communicate with us, then I take it at face value that they would not tell us this if it were not true. When I see the so-called “mounting evidence” that people do communicate with the dead, I remain skeptical, not because of some blind, narrow-minded belief in _The URANTIA Book_, but rather because of the enlightened backdrop the book, read in its entirety, gives us, which has given me good cause to believe in it.

_The URANTIA Book_ and Jesus gives us an idea of the patterns of God and how he does things — his nature and character is so beautifully revealed, that it melts the heart of any true believer. Jesus appealed to the personality of the individual. As the events leading up to the crisis in Capernaum showed us, he refused to give in to the temptation of leading the masses with wonders and miracles. He wanted the individuals to discover the Kingdom of Heaven within. _The URANTIA Book_ is not dogmatic, but rather it appeals to our sense of reasoning as well as our spiritual yearnings. Neither Jesus nor _The URANTIA Book_ need credentials. Their authority is the truth they proclaim and that is all that is required.

If someone told me that they were a member of the Reserve Corps of Destiny and had been given a message (and were using the fact that they were a reservist in order for me to take them seriously) I would immediately be on my guard because if they were a reservist, and knew it, I don't believe they would go around telling people. It would not be compatible with the style of how reservist are used as explained in _The URANTIA Book_.

The fact that this Elijah the Third finds his credentials in _The URANTIA Book_ by blatantly saying he is the fulfilment of the prophecy by being the greater John the Baptist the book spoke of, then I am on my guard. It doesn't fit with the way things are done. The contact person used for _The URANTIA Book_ revelation had to die first before the book was published and the contact group were sworn to secrecy never to reveal the name, so that no human being would ever be associated with the revelation! So how can you expect a URANTIA Book Fundamentalist like me to swallow this Elijah character, for heavens sake? If he was the greater John the Baptist, his style would be very different. Also I doubt if he would be blatantly asking for financial assistance and distorting that famous saying of Jesus “the harvest is plentiful but the labourers are few”. The man has a hide! I know enough of his message to see that he has taken bits and pieces out of _The URANTIA Book_, woven them in with Biblical quotes and prophecies, thrown in bits and pieces that will appeal to a whole range of people and has presented it as a clever but somewhat transparent package. The message isn't even new! He's implying that life will be a bed of roses after all the upheavals — how does this fit in with my fundamental number 3 , where God needs beings who have been perfected through the long struggle of the Paradise ascent — sorry it doesn't fit in with the way God runs his universe. We have to work hard for it all the way to Paradise.

And besides “What is it to a kingdom believer if all things earthly crash?” Why should we be concerned with the end of the world? The papers on the Mansion Worlds are enough to make any believer look forward to death. Who needs to know about Graceland to receive comfort? If our planet does blow up and some of us are transported to another world to carry on (as _The URANTIA Book_ says could happen if the human race was in jeopardy of extinction) then great — so be it — why the big deal about it now? If it happens, it happens and we deal with it then how we deal with any event — we do the best we can and carry on. If we wake up on the Mansion Worlds and carry on from where we left off, then I doubt that the Mansion Worlds are a bed of roses, so why should being transported to Graceland suddenly make everything wonderful?

So Label me a URANTIA Book Fundamentalist if you will. I can't see how any other URANTIA Book Fundamentalist can take Elijah the Third seriously.

## Reflections on Mota, Language and Humour

I have been re-reading the rather few remarks about 'mota'.

> “Mota is more than a superior philosophy; it is to philosophy as two eyes are to one; it has a stereoscopic effect on meanings and values. Material man sees the universe, as it were, with but one eye — flat. Mansion world students achieve cosmic perspective — depth — by superimposing the perceptions of the morontia life upon the perceptions of the physical life.” ([UB 48:6.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_28))

I was later able to relate this to my interest in language and humour, and my unease about the poverty of the descriptions of humour in _The URANTIA Book_. I have always known that one of the prime sources of humour lies in the structure, the formalism, of language. Because of the symbolism a statement can have a variety of meanings. The context may show which is intended, and the hearer normally is unaware of any other meaning because of being tuned in to that context. However, the more lateral thinker (or language freak, like me) can often see more than the intended meaning. The surprise of the sudden realisation of another twist is one of the manifestations of humour, and for me a significant one. If the speaker has also seen it, then this may be a deliberate joke; if the speaker hasn't seen it then the hearer is well advised to let it pass, but maybe still enjoy the humour of it internally.

Now: if we take a rather wide interpretation of the meaning of philosophy, we see that the existence of mota means that to the morontian these alternative meanings are present and available simultaneously. There is no sudden appreciation of an alternative, and sudden realisation is the basis for this type of humour. So the morontian does not see this kind of juxtaposition as a source of humour, though there may well be some analogous feeling which has not been described to us, and for obvious reasons. It is possible to extend this train of thought and suggest that the mortal who has learned to appreciate this kind of humour is also on the way to understanding something of what mota means while still in his material state.

There are some snags to this train of thought also. Learning that languages were still a necessary part of communication even beyond the local universe was a shock to me: I had always imagined that some kind of telepathy operated, that mind looked at mind and was aware of thought content. I was reconciled to this by noting that language provides some privacy, some personal uniqueness, which would be impossible with a universally operating telepathy. Language allows me to tell you things or refrain from doing so. In some sense it is like our skin which allows us to retain our moisture, and without which we quickly die of dehydration. Granted the continuance of language, then, we still have to operate with symbols, and the symbols essentially have several meanings. Thus the possibility of ‘language humour’ would seem to continue to exist in the morontia and the spirit states, and we seem to have turned the whole argument on its head. The fault may be that I have interpreted 'philosophy' too widely, and that the concept of mota is more restricted than I have supposed. It all needs working on.

## Many Paths

My Beloved, so many different paths open before you. Some of those whom you love travel on one path, some on another. You, when you have attained the true consciousness of the Christ, greet these wayfarers and know that they likewise walk the steep trail even though it be a different one than that over which your feet carry you. You know that all these trials will lead at last to Holy Peace.

You shall not be confused, neither shall you add to confusion for them, for paths, though seemingly divergent, shall meet at last at the Father dwelling and you shall all join together in the heavenly anthem of praise and adoration.

Therefore, why concern yourself over whether others seem not to go your way? It is of little importance in My sight. All that matters is that they feel a consciousness of  My love and Holy Presence that I may guide their feet through the pitfalls that lie on every journey regardless of the way. I care for my own and gently lead them into paths of righteousness.

## A Rhyme in Time

In the unqualified there is differential, 
In the actual there is potential. 
In the unity there is trinity, 
In the finite there is infinity. 
In the relationship there is tension 
In the depths there is ascension. 
In the static there is decision, 
And in the difference there is division. 
But division is relative in disaster, 
We're all serving, still, the same Master.

**Simon Barber, Melbourne**



## Space Probe Takes Photos of Heaven!

**From: Life Beyond Death, June 1990**

Startling photographs shot by a Soviet space probe may be of heaven, a top German scientist reports.

“The pictures are remarkable in their similarity to what people have seen during near-death experiences,” Dr. Kurt Bauer, the astrophysicist, told reporters in Magdeburg, Germany.

"When the series begins we see darkness gradually giving way to a rainbow-colored tunnel of light. The probe enters this tunnel.

"As it emerges we are met with an unearthly green and yellow landscape. In the distance we can see people filing through the gates of a great walled city that literally glitters under an intense golden light.

"The probe beamed hundreds of these pictures back to Earth before a mechanical problem or some outside force caused the cameras to malfunction.

“And I don't think it's going too far to say that the photos we did get are potentially more important than anything we have gotten from our exploration of space to date.”

Tight-lipped Russian officials would neither confirm nor deny Dr. Bauer's report. They did confirm that the expert had worked closcly with Soviet space scientists since 1979 and acknowledged that “he would have access to photographs if they do exist.”

The expert himself said the Soviets consider the photos top secret and have no intentions of releasing them in the foresecable future.

“As atheists the Soviets are sensitive to any notion of an afterlife and they want all the answers before they make any kind of announcement,” said Dr. Bauer.

“They certainly weren't looking for heaven with this probe. It was designed to photograph planets.” In fact, the probe had already passed Pluto and was headed for deep space when the stunning pictures were taken," said Dr. Bauer.

“Attempts to re-establish communications with it have failed but will continue for several months,” he said.

Marc Degois, the French parapsychologist, called Dr. Bauer's report “staggering in its implications.”

“Men can hallucinate but cameras don't lie,” he continued. "The truly amazing thing about all this is how closely the Soviet photos mirror the visual experiences of people who have died momentarily and been brought back to life.

“Scientists and doctors have long wondered whether those experiences were simply figments of the imagination.”

“The Soviet photos, if genuine, prove conclusively that they are real.”

“It's ironic that Soviet atheists would be the first to confirm the existence of an afterlife.”

## Find the Missing Link

**Report on Workshop of NOOSA '89**

This workshop was held in conjunction with an Australia-wide meeting of URANTIA Book readers at Noosa, Queensland during October 1989 which was attended by 31 devotees, coming from Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland, and including one visitor from the United States. The subject of the workshop was a quotation from UB 155:1.4 of _The URANTIA Book_, made by Jesus as follows:

> “_Let me state emphatically this eternal truth: If you, by truth co-ordination, learn to exemplify in your lives this beautiful wholeness of righteousness, your fellow men will then seek after you that they may gain what you have so acquired. The measure of your truth endowment, your righteousness. The extent to which you have to go with your message to the people is, in a way, the measure of your failure to live the whole or righteous life, the truth co-ordinated life._” [UB 155:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_4)

Since direct observation indicates that very few URANTIA Book readers are being trampled by crowds of truth seekers, the Sunshine Coast study group undertook an attempt to discover what may be missing in the way we live our lives that prevents crowds from flocking to us. Possible clues were located, firstly on [UB 194:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_6) where, in speaking about the very earliest Christian community that formed immediately after Pentecost, the Book tells us that: “_Nevertheless they were filled with joy, and they lived such new and unique lives that all men were attracted to their teachings about Jesus_”. Another clue was located in the section entitled, ‘As Jesus passed by’, on [UB 171:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_1) which states: “_Jesus spread good cheer everywhere he went. He was full of grace and truth. His associates never ceased to wonder at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. You can cultivate gracefulness, but graciousness is the aroma of friendliness that emanates from a love-saturated soul_”.

From these three quotes, key words were selected and the Reference Aid for _The URANTIA Book_ was utilized (courtesy of the Brotherhood of Man Library) to generate 96 quotes (29 typed pages) of material that might be relevant to the problem of the missing link. This material was distributed to each participant prior to the workshop taking place with the request to mark passages that each thought bore on the problem, and also to add any other quotes from the Book that were thought to be relevant.

At the workshop we divided into five groups and the quotes selected by individuals were discussed in terms of concepts set out on [UB 101:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p6_8) where we are told: “_The teachings of Jesus constituted the first Urantian religion which so fully embraced a harmonious co-ordination of knowledge, wisdom, faith, truth, and love as completely and simultaneously to provide temporal tranquility, intellectual certainty, moral enlightenment, philosophic stability, ethical sensitivity, God-consciousness, and the positive assurance of personal survival. The faith of Jesus pointed the way to finality of human salvation, to the ultimate of mortal universe attainment, since it provided for:..._” Then follows a description of 7 points of personality growth that may be briefly summarized as salvation from:

1. Material fetters through realization of sonship with God.
2. Intellectual bondage — truth will set us free.
3. Spiritual blindness — discovery of the spiritual value of service.
4. Incompleteness of self — through attainment of spirituality.
5. Limitations of self — release from ego domination.
6. Time — certainty of eternal life; progression in God recognition.
7. The finite — through perfected oneness with Deity.

During the discussions, individuals indicated their thoughts about how the various quotations related to the ‘missing link’. The most relevant ones are listed below in the order of the greatest number of votes received.

### Top Ten from NOOSA ' 89

> 1. “_Nevertheless, they were filled with joy, and they lived such new and unique lives that all men were attracted to their teachings about Jesus_”.([UB 194:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_6))

> 2. “_By the old way you seek to suppress, obey, and conform to the rules of living; by the new way you are first transformed by the Spirit of Truth and thereby strengthened in your inner soul by the constant spiritual renewing of your mind, and so are you endowed with the power of the certain and joyous performance of the gracious, acceptable, and perfect will of God. Forget not — it is your personal faith in the exceedingly great and precious promises of God that ensures your becoming partakers of the divine nature. Thus by your faith and the spirit's transformation, you become in reality the temples of God, and his spirit actually dwells within you. If, then, the spirit dwells within you, you are no longer bondslaves of the flesh but free and liberated sons of the spirit. The new law of the spirit endows you with the liberty of self-mastery in place of the old law of the fear of self-bondage and the slavery of self-denial_”. ([UB 143:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_4))

> 3. “_You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick; and it gives light to all who are in the house. Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and be led to glorify your Father who is in heaven._”
> 
> “_While light dispels darkness, it can also be so “blinding” as to confuse and frustrate. We are admonished to let our light so shine that our fellows will be guided into new and godly paths of enhanced living. Our light should so shine as not to attract attention to self. Even one's vocation can be utilized as an effective “reflector” for the dissemination of this light of life._” ([UB 140:4.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_4))

> 4. “_Jesus spread good cheer everywhere he went. He was full of grace and truth. His associates never ceased to wonder at the gracious words that proceeded out of his mouth. You can cultivate gracefulness, but graciousness is the aroma of friendliness which emanates from a love-saturated soul._”
> 
> “_Goodness always compels respect, but when it is devoid of grace, it often repels affection. Goodness is universally attractive only when it is gracious. Goodness is effective only when it is attractive_”. ([UB 171:7.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_1))

> 5. “_You cannot reveal God to those who do not seek for him; you cannot lead unwilling souls into the joys of salvation. Man must become hungry for truth as a result of the experiences of living or he must desire to know God as the result of contact with the lives of those who are acquainted with the divine Father before another human being can act as the means of leading such a fellow mortal to the Father in heaven. If we know God, our real business on earth is so to live as to permit the Father to reveal himself in our lives, and thus will all God-seeking persons see the Father and ask for our help in finding out more about the God who in this manner finds expression in our lives_”. ([UB 132:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p7_2))

> 6. “_Happiness and joy take origin in the inner life. You cannot experience real joy all by yourself. A solitary life is fatal to happiness. Even families and nations will enjoy life more if they share it with others_”. ([UB 111:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p4_7))

> 7. “_I cannot but observe that so many of you spend so much time and thought on mere trifles of living, while you almost wholly overlook the more essential realities of everlasting import, those very accomplishments which are concerned with the development of a more haermonious working agreement between you and your Adjusters. The great goal of human existence is to attune to the divinity of the indwelling Adjuster; the great achievement of mortal life is the attainment of a true and under- standing consecration to the eternal aims of the divine spirit who waits and works within your mind. But a devoted and determined effort to realize eternal destiny is wholly compatible with a light-hearted and joyous life and with a successful and honourable career on earth. Co-operation with the Thought Adjuster does not entail self-torture, mock piety, or hypocritical and ostentatious sef-abasement; the ideal life is one of loving service rather than an existence of fearful apprehension_”. ([UB 110:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_4))

> 8. “_But the great problem of religious living consists in the task of unifying the soul powers of the personality by the dominance of LOVE. Health, mental efficiency, and happiness arise from the unification of physical systems, mind systems, and spirit systems. Of health and sanity man understands much, but of happiness he has truly realized very little. The highest happiness is indissolubly linked with spiritual progress. Spiritual progress yields lasting joy, peace which passes all understanding._” ([UB 100:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_3))

> 9. “_It is the presence of the divine Spirit, the water of life, that prevents the consuming thirst of mortal discontent and that indescribable hunger of the unspiritualized human mind. Spirit-motivated beings 'never thirst, for this spiritual water shall be in them a well of satisfaction springing up into everlasting life'. Such divinely watered souls are all but independent of material environment as regards the joys of living and the satisfaction of earthly existence. They are spiritually illuminated and refreshed, morally strengthened and endowed_”. ([UB 34:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_8))

> 10. “_And so must we clearly recognize that neither the golden rule nor the teaching of nonresistance can ever be properly understood as dogmas or precepts. They can only be comprehended by living them, by realizing their meanings in the living interpretation of the Spirit of Truth, who directs the loving contact of one human being with another._” ([UB 180:5.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_11))

Towards the conclusion of the workshop, Trevor Swadling, representing his group, leapt to his feet and declared with great joy that “JOY” is the missing link. Nobody disagreed. This joy is, of course, a very special kind of joy that emanates from our knowledge of, and our love of, the Father-Spirit that dwells within us and our complete confidence that, in seeking to do his will, the security of our destiny is totally assured.

## Recipe for the Home

Take half a cup of friendship and one cup of thoughtfulness and cream together with a pinch of powdered tenderness.

Beat very lightly in a bowl of loyalty, with one cup of faith, one of hope and one of love.

Be sure to add a teaspoonful each of gaiety and ability to laugh at little things.

Moisten with the sudden tears of heartfelt sympathy, then bake in a good natured pie and serve.

## E-3 in Australia!

I listened to all five Elijah Ministry tapes, the “Message from God” and the four in the GRACELAND series. Do I believe them? Yes. Do I believe in the truth of _The URANTIA Book_? Yes. Do the two clash or contradict eachother? In my opinion, no. At worst, it is one man's fascinating and well researched hypothesis, worth listening to in its own right. At best, it is a further relevation about some extra hiccups our planet may have to go through. The Graceland adventure is supposed to only last thirty years or so, then we return to a rejuvenated Earth. So its no big deal, really. The future history of Urantia may well show Graceland to be a little aside on our inevitable march towards light and life.

A small group in Melbourne has recently set up a “branch” of the Ministry which will shortly make tapes and other material available locally. The address is

PO Box 281, Ashburton, Vic. 3147.

## The Great Kentucky Volcanic Eruption

**From: COSMIC REFLECTIONS, Summer/Fall 1990**

Evidence found by a geologist named Warren Huff indicates that “ 1000 cubic kilometres of material spewed out during at least one and probably two eruptions ...” according to an article in the June 18,1990 issue of **Insight** magazine. This eruption is believed to be from: “... a massive volcano they believe once was located, in the process of continental drift, where the Great Smoky Mountains in the southeastern United States are today. The eruptions are believed to have occurred more than 400 million years ago and may deserve the title of most powerful eruptions ever.”

We are informed by _The URANTIA Book_ that about 330 million years ago there occurred

> “_... the eruption of the great North American volcano of eastern Kentucky, one of the greatest single volcanic activities the world has ever known. The ashes of this volcano covered five hundred square miles to a depth of from fifteen to twenty feet._” ([UB 59:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p2_5))

## The Need for Group Wisdom

Since the publication of my article 'From E.T. to E-3' in the last 6-0-6, two months have elapsed and we all have had time to cool down from either indignation or excitement, depending on whether you are a believer or a disbeliever.

From some of the feedback I have received via telephone conversations and letters, it appears that some people have regarded my case of 'keeping an open mind on the matter' more or less as blackmail, some felt it was inappropriate for the editor to write in the manner the article was written, some didn't want to know about it and some felt it had nothing to do with _The URANTIA Book_.

Other people who initially did not want to listen to the GRACELAND Tapes, changed their mind as a result of the article and can now see why I felt it was important enough to include in the newsletter.

I thank you all for your reactions whatever they were and I do not feel offended in any way because I do understand them.

Although the attitude of some people is to try and ignore the whole situation so that it may go away by itself, I'm questioning the wisdom of this attitude.

As I feel that we probably all agree that our first responsibility as readers of _The URANTIA Book_ is to protect the book's integrity, this 'Message from God' by Elijah the Third could be either the biggest challenge or the biggest threat the URANTIA 'movement' has ever faced. And I would like to repeat my invitation for people to evaluate and comment on it. I feel we need the wisdom of the group to deal with this situation. Even if this message was true, and we may not know for certain, publicly we cannot connect it to _The URANTIA Book_. There is always the risk that it isn't true. E-3 may know for sure, but we don't. We cannot expect the URANTIA Foundation to endorse it.

E-3 does not claim any paranormal happenings in the way he has received this message, but it is still his personal experience. I respect anybody's personal religious experience, but when this experience becomes public property and can affect the lives of many people, it requires the wisdom of the group to know how best to deal with it.

E-3's message uses the concepts of _The URANTIA Book_ without referring to the book, but it is still his personal interpretation which will be presented to the public for which it is primarily meant. Will not sooner or later this message be publicly connected to _The URANTIA Book_?

These are just some of the aspects which I would like to see more openly discussed among us.
I personally feel and I know from the feedback so far there is a lot of spiritual content in his message and if we take it through the test _The URANTIA Book_ suggests on page 1000:6 it would pass. But I still feel we have to tread carefully.

If indeed this mass evacuation is to take place (and it is not an impossibility, otherwise the revelators would not have mentioned it) then we have a responsibility towards out fellowmen to pass the message on.

If it isn't true, then irreparable damage could be done to the movement.

May I suggest that we look at it in an objective and unemotional way without prejudice and pre-conceived ideas. Let the Spirit of Truth do its own work and give it a bit of time. We need some group wisdom here.

I also like to sound a warning to the people who do believe in this message not to start an Elijah cult. According to him his ministry and prophesy was only meant to reveal the Graceland evacuation and what happens after it, any comments he makes on the current geopolitical situation are not to be taken as gospel since they are only speculation on his part. He has made an extensive study of existing prophesies, e.g. The Bible and Nostradamus, but it still remains speculation. I would not like to see a situation where people hang on every word he says and then pass it on as gospel.

Some people have suggested that this could bring dissension within the URANTIA movement. It will split us up in believers and non-believers, they say. Is it also possible for us to work through this situation with people having patience, tolerance and respect for other people's beliefs? And if the believers want to organize themselves to be of service to their fellowmen in the event of a possible emergency, that we allow them to do that with the understanding that this ministry should publicly not be connected to _The URANTIA Book_?

It is not the purpose of this article to evaluate the spiritual content of this message. I'll leave it up to readers to either do that for themselves or not do it at all if that is what they wish.

I would like to say a few words about my co-editor Neil Francey, who, although he personally did not feel inclined to listen to this 'message' has been very patient and loyal in his support of my editorship. In his last letter to me Neil wrote: "This entire issue is very healthy for all and I welcome and encourage lots more comment and discussion. Emphasises the one reality and the many 'issues'.

I do think UB readers have set new parameters in these matters. Opinions may differ, but love and respect for the person and their sonship is always undiminished."

What more can I say?

## “The Answer Book”

Just recently, while I was having dinner with a group of my friends and some of their family, I had the opportunity to talk about _The URANTIA Book_ with the host who has been reading the book for the past six months. One of the young persons present mistakenly overheard us talking about “The Answer Book” as she thought we called it and asked what it was about.

After I had spent a couple of hours telling the group about “The Answer Book” I had time to reflect on this new name. How appropriate, I thought, if ever there was a book with the answer to just about everything, _The URANTIA Book_ certainly fits this description. I guess it will always be my “Answer Book”.
