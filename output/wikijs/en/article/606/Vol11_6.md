## “Thought For The Month”

> “Simply go forth proclaiming: This is the Kingdom of Heaven — God is your Father and you are his sons, and this good news, if you wholeheartedly believe it, is your eternal salvation.” ([UB 141:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p6_4))

## Warburton Conference 1990

An Australian meeting of URANTIA Book readers was held on Melbourne Cup weekend, Saturday November 3 to Tuesday November 6 . We journeyed to Warburton East, about 80 ~km east of Melbourne, at the foot of the Great Dividing Range.

Springtime weather — three warm sunny days and one fine cloudy day — let us enjoy the charm and amenities of the 12 acre property and the beauty of the whole area. The favoured local attractions seemed to be the fauna sanctuary at Healesville, the Upper Yarra Dam, and the magical short walk through the beautiful rain forest alongside Cement Creek (located about halfway to the summit of Mount Donna Buang).

Forty-seven people participated in the conference, plus three visitors who met old friends and then joined us for the Happy Hour on Monday evening.

Australians travelled from as far away as Queensland and Western Australia, and three overseas travellers joined us from the U.S.A. Fifteen people took advantage of early arrival on Friday evening, to socialise and enjoy the area through Saturday morning. The next three nights saw 44,39 , and 38 people in residence — some could only stay for a two-day weekend. The numbers were comfortable for the venue, rather than crowded, and we broke even financially.

We opened with Saturday lunch together, followed by a reporting session where thirteen people contributed. Having thus founded the conference on fellowship and individual initiative, the group maintained them throughout.

For the conference theme of “Living as we are meant to live”, we used the focus offered in _The URANTIA Book_ on UB 46:5.29

> “The activities of such a world are of three distinct varieties: work, progress, and play. Stated otherwise, they are: service, study, and relaxation. The composite activities consist of social intercourse, group entertainment, and divine worship.” [UB 46:5.29](/en/The_Urantia_Book/46#p5_29)

For “work/service”, there was a forum discussion on URANTIA Book distribution in Australia. Of the many issues, consensus emerged on two points (both of which require agreement from URANTIA Foundation):

1) continue the personalised distribution networks, and
2) appoint a distributor so the book will be listed in catalogues held by bookstores.

Also on “service/work”, there was an assignment to incorporate into the free afternoon on Monday.

For “progress/study”, a forum allowed individuals to share their thoughts on the development of their relationship with God (without necessarily intruding on the relationship itself). Like all but one or two sessions, this was held in the garden under the trees.

“Play/relaxation” was emphasised by extensive periods of free time. As I wrote in the July/August Six-O-Six: “People told me they liked recent conferences because of the ‘atmosphere’, because of the friendship and fellowship ...”

On Sunday night, individuals and small groups were free to organise to their own tastes, which ranged from study groups to indoor games to videos to chatting to early in bed. The idea of a half-day bus excursion, though successful in 1988 (bus) and in 1989 (boat), was dropped in favour of private car trips on free afternoons, or evenings between dinner and entertainment. People grouped and re-grouped, and went when and where they chose.

“Social intercourse” was inevitably emphasised along with “Play/relaxation”. It was further emphasised by three unhurried sit-down serviced meals each day, plus half-hour breaks for morning and afternoon teas, and supper arrangements. It was prompted by the variety of settings to meet and chat, both indoors and outdoors. It was the focus of small group workshops, followed by a report-back to the whole group. (The question posed to each individual was: “What is social intercourse for you, or what does it actually mean to you now?”) A second question asked for URANTIA Book inspiration or insight in this area, but drew surprisingly little feedback most groups seemed to focus directly on their own experience.

“Group entertainment” saw a sing-along around the campfire on Saturday night, with guitarists Verner Verass and Kathleen and Trevor Swadling, and banjo player Richard Keeler (said to be a refugee from the great state of Wyoming). Several families sharing the site joined us for this highlight. Will Wentworth and Tony Rudd contributed some torchlight readings of Australian bush poetry.

The musicians fired up again on Monday night for an Australian bush dance, preceded by a recital by Trevor and Kathleen notable for Trevor's own compositions including spiritual themes.

“Divine worship” was, in the end, largely left to the individual. We did precede our closing barbecue with a simple but sensitive direct reading of the remembrance supper, courtesy Sue Webb and Simon Barber. The three early-morning meditations were generously designed and led by Maggie Chandler, Richard Keeler, and Martin Myers.

Though the whole conference was blessed by the weather, my most vivid picture is of Monday morning's meditation in the “fairy dell” on the hill, the sun about to break over the trees, and low clouds skidding across the stunning views of Mount Donna Buang.

Ian Esmore prepared and chaired an open forum discussion on world government, titled “Current Middle East Conflict and the United Nations”. Les Sheridan delivered a paper on “The Right and Left Brain”. Terry Hovaghimiam followed Les with a reflective presentation that shared his own life. Leith Luckett offered a reflection which seemed to summarise our weekend. Carl Sarelius presented a paper on his epic solo walk from Melbourne to Sydney. It was a fitting finale for the conference, interweaving physical and emotional experiences with mental observations and insights, in a real spiritual sharing by Carl. I thought that this symbolized what so many attendees brought to the whole of this conference.

_Editors note:_

_Many people have asked me to again pass on their heartelt gratitude to Martin for the splendid way in which he organised the conference._

## The Right And Left Brain

_Talk given by Les Sheridan at the 1990 Australian Annual Conference for Readers of The URANTIA Book_.

We do not express our true potential. We use but a fraction of our brain. The brain is in two sections, the right and left hemispheres.

THE RIGHT BRAIN is the realm of genius, intuition, visionaries and seers and it is here that contact with a higher degree of universal knowledge is made. It is receptive, and subjective, recording diligently all communications without analysis or discrimination. It is innocent of guile. This is the realm of intuition, inner tuition. The female aspect.

THE LEFT BRAIN is the realm of logic, reason, intellect and choice, and it is here that contact is made through the senses with the outer material world. It is in the left brain that we plan, formulate and adjust continually to survive in this transient material world of changing values, laws and circumstances. It is objective, aggressive and insistent. The male aspect.

One cannot plan and build with certainty on this sand of constantly changing values, theories and political assurances. For example, Dr. Lardner (1793-1889) Professor of Natural Philosophy and Astronomy at University College London said ...“Rail travel at high speed is not possible, passengers being unable to breathe, would die.” He also said ...“No large steamship would ever cross the Atlantic because it would require more coal than it could carry.” The 'Great Western' crossed two years later. Ernest Mach (1838-1916) Professor of Physics at the University of Vienna, said ... “I can accept the theory of relativity as little as I can accept the existence of atoms and other such dogmas.” Ernest Rutherford (1871-1937) after he had split the atom for the first time said ... “the energy produced by the breaking down of the atom is a poor kind of a thing. Anyone who expects a source of power from the transformation of these atoms is talking moonshine” etc. etc.

Joining the right and left brain are bridges of nerve matter — the medulla (lower) and the corpus callosum (upper). Thought patterns pass over these bridges ... I believe the outer material left brain thoughts use the lower bridge, whilst the higher universal right brain thoughts pass over the upper bridge.

In this material age, the left brain using the lower bridge is more active with local material issues than the right brain using the upper bridge to passover higher universal issues. There is imbalance, and it manifests in disharmony, discord, distress and disease at personal, communal and national levels. How often when labouring the mind with plans, arbitrary agreements, reports and theories, have you massaged the base of your skull, the area of this lower bridge, the base or lower bridge for base or lower thought patterns, and similarly, having exhausted your logic and the advice of men, lowered your head into your hand, the hand on top, in despair.

You are intuitively being shown the way through your problem. For don't the ancient writings say ... “I am your God. I will instruct you in the way that you will go.”

The truth of an individual life is within, wanting to get out. It is not outside trying to get in. The oak is within the acorn, and so it is with all forms of life.

The way of course, is to listen to your right female mind, to receive this altogether wonderful truth of your life. Look into it, hear it, acknowledge it as worthy of your total dedication and commitment, and act on it, obeying it to the letter. Do this in every ongoing situation. Put it into effect by using your God-given skills and talents to express it in the material world. You will then be building on a sure rock foundation. You will be manifesting or creating true.

So, we have the female aspect receiving the higher ideals of your life from the high or grand mind, the universal mind, and wanting to present, to passover this precious truth to the practical, objective male aspect for it to be established in the material world. Here is the voice of intuition, the inner tutor, the still small voice of the supreme Architect and Teacher. The voice of intuition flies in the face of logic (steam trains, steam ships, nuclear energy are fact despite the logic of Lardner, Mach and Rutherford).

The authority for what I am saying is ... God said, “let us create man in our image ... male and female created he them and called their names Adam and Eve (mortal)”.

The right and left brain in balance, is entrance to higher degrees of knowledge.

Leave, with these thoughts and assurances ... the area of the corpus callosum is the fontanelle, which means font or fountain. Fountain of higher life, higher knowledge. The fairy or star at the top of the Christmas tree. The seat or throne of spirituality in a mortal. The kingdom of life is within.

I stand at the door and knock (it is an inner door).

The wisdom of God is foolish in the eyes of man, the wisdom of man is foolish in the eyes of God.

Don't concern yourself with the things of the world. Seek first the kingdom of life within and all things will be added to you. Don't you know you are a temple of the Holy Spirit of Life?

The Spirit is a two-edged sword, rightly dividing material from spirit. Don't build on sand. Call upon me in your day of trouble and I will deliver you. Ask, seek, knock, where? The right mind. The chalice, the cup or container of your truth of life. Truth, life, passover corpus, the way words are used in this address. Do they resonate in your mind as they do in mine?

**Les Sheridan, Warburton, Victoria**

## Conference Reflections

I thoroughly enjoyed the happy atmosphere and one ness of Spirit. Reflecting on Christ Jesus, on Urantia, becoming the at-one-ment between God and men.

Restoring relationships.

May we all be one in the brotherhood of men under the one Fatherhood of God.

I love you all.

Loui de Keizer, Melbourne

Jesus said, the Kingdom of Heaven is not of this world. When I remember this I feel I can overcome my own weaknesses.

When my very quiet friend is able to introduce this spiritual value into my mind I know why he is only measured by the sounds of silence.

My nerves were so jangled before this meeting I began to lose faith in finding answers to questions only Jesus could answer.

Jesus looked down and saw this life as only a bridge.

The Supreme Being knows what you need but you must strengthen the things that remain by cooperating instead of competing with your quiet friend.

## How I Feel

_This beautiful poem was written by Leith during the 1990 Australian Conference._

I'm composed, and full of feeling.
I'm enwrapped in silent healing.
The air flows cool in the Father's mountains.
There isn't much to say
how we spend each pleasant day,
but know, deep down within,
that God's Spark is close to Him.
Our walks of life take different tolls 
of moods, of thoughts, we're all different moulds.
Sometimes we cry for inner peace.
We're glad to have a part, a piece
of Life's adjusting inwardly and outwards.
The chores of climbing and the upward search
to find a cloud, a rising perch.
The Pilot watches, waits, and prompts us.
The waiting seems in patience dwells.
We burn the midnight oils of searching
to do the will, within ourselves.
I'm looking back on years of thinking.
I'm slowly moving, I'm surely not sinking.
And while I have the goal in sight,
I'll carry on my Godward flight,
merging, feeling; it's a pleasant surprise
to grasp, enjoy, and embrace all my ties.


**Leith Luckett, Melbourne**

## A “Truth Junkie”

As usual, since I began expanding my quest for truth with the aid of _The URANTIA Book_ and just attended my second conference, the time together has passed so fulfillingly quickly, with such a delight in events and people sharing a similar basic experience of truth, which we are embracing from all angles of our spiritual intuitive presence and states of America and Australia, that I am no longer surprised by the speed of reply to my questions, especially to questions that I have forgotten to ask whilst at the conference.

All I have to do is to open my eyes and my awareness and my communicating skills with sincere loving trust, and the answer appears there and then, as simple as in the next paragraph of the book, which most of us have so often found while reading. I don't believe that I am such an unique individual who has any special talents or gifts or who might be different to anyone else that is existing on this planet. Apart from certain physical and customary individual characteristics, we are all the same. I only want to share my personal discoveries of truth, not only with you but with as many other people as I can, and to be able to discover ways to communicate these and other messages and to be flexible in the use of the limited medium of language, that it becomes extremely frustrating and especially when you the reader have the choice.

It is very comforting to know that TRUTH IS and will be and that we cannot change it — we attempt to but all we do is to distort it or prolong its discovery.

So by slowly introducing a new habit into our lives we can change and start to experience a new, exciting way of living our so called boring, mundane lives that has managed to survive the test of time, and we don't have to go out of this world. We can start from where we are. There will initially be some costs — firstly you will have to make some time in your daily experiences to include truth. You will have to be careful because it can be addictive, so don't overdose from the beginning. You can start alone, when no one is watching. You can do it in the privacy of your own room and eventually after you start applying it into your daily life you can move into the next phase which is called sharing. Here you have to be careful who you share it with, because it can cause problems for you and it might mean going out of your way to be with people who are willing to join you in a session of truth and you might want more and more and develop new friendships with others and then you are eventually labeled a 'truth junkie'. You find that you might have to move out of the society that you have fallen into and if you are lucky discover a group who are involved in truth worshipping and occasionally have weekly or fortnightly sessions and perhaps have national and probably international sessions.

If this happens to you, count your blessings because this will be the best experience that will happen to you, especially since it will have cost you the purchase of one book that is filled with over 2000 pages of truth, and if you are lucky it will take you at least one lifetime to experience all the basics of truth, not to talk about any other side effects such as love, joy, and maybe Godliness and possible perfection.

Having shared a four-day conference at Arrabri Lodge in East Warburton in Victoria with a group of over 50 people from all over Australia and from the USA who are such fascinatingly simple individuals of different ages and experiences who happen to have been brought together through a book called “_The URANTIA Book_”, I can honestly say that this has been the most rewarding time in my life on so many levels and with so many people in such a short period of time, that the friendships that have been experienced through the Fatherhood of God and in the Brotherhood of Man are everlastingly united in eternal love.

**Terry Hovaghimian, Sydney**

## From Our Mailbox

Dear Six-O-Six,

I enjoyed reading all of the articles and letters about E-3 in the September/October 1990 issue although two of the letters were somewhat illogical, not to mention unfair.

After writing a column and a half making her case, Ann Bendall blows it all by saying, “I have not listened to the tapes but can only assume ...” If I were a computer I would say, “ERROR, ERROR, DOES NOT COMPUTE!” It is tantamount to saying, “I don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm going to write an article about it anyway”. I wonder if it is really too much to expect that one hear the message before one picks up pen and paper to write about it? It would be so much better if one could say, “I've listened to the tapes and evaluated them thoughtfully and I find them at fault because ...” A person could respect that approach.

The letter from Kathleen Swadling, while it contained some wonderful connections from _The URANTIA Book_, also took a beating when she said, “... had no intention of listening to them”.

Great! What is there to fear? (And that seems like it could be the only real problem, doesn't it?) Maybe one will get “brainwashed” by listening to them. Agondonters are those who believe without seeing. This must be something like that. People who don't believe without listening. Oh well, to each his/her own, I guess.

Regarding the article about, “The Answer Book”, a friend of mine called the book store and ordered a copy of _The URANTIA Book_. Several weeks later she got a call that her book was in. She went down to the book store and they handed her “The Tarantula Book”. Special order!

## Coming To A “Final Decision”

_The URANTIA Book_ states:

> “_In the early days of the struggle Lucifer held forth continuously in the planetary amphitheatre. Gabriel conducted an unceasing exposure of the rebel sophistries from his headquarters taken up near at hand. The various personalities present on the sphere who were in doubt as to their attitude would journey back and forth between these discussions until they arrived at a final decision._” ([UB 53:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p5_6))

It is apparent that URANTIA Book readers and prospective URANTIA Book readers are being divided into two camps: those who believe in the gospel of Mr. Pope and those who through some understanding or contrary evidence of their own refute it outright.

My position is that of the latter. I do not believe that Mr. Pope's gospel nor his actions in distributing it world wide compare in the least with Lucifer's rebellion, however, the fact that readers are being provoked into coming to a 'final decision' about his mission and ministry one way or the other deserves the exposure of sincere argument from the opposing perspective. Both perspectives, that of Mr. Pope and that of any opponent to his ideas, are just opinions, nothing more than that. Yet it is from the highest spiritual wisdom contained within each of these opinions that readers and prospective readers in need of reaching their 'final decision' on the matter shall draw. Ultimately, inevitably, and thankfully, it is the domain of each individual to draw their own conclusions and make their own solemn 'final decision'.

This author assumes that you are familiar with Mr. Pope's “salvation message of good news to a distracted world” in that you have perhaps heard the news live from Mr. Pope or have heard his tapes. To refresh you here is a brief synopsis of the salient points:

- seven years' tribulations begins in 1990
- world to end in Nuclear Winter
- over two billion selected people evacuated by angels
- emergency world Graceland like Garden of Eden
- last judgement selects evacuees, began in 1987
- people transformed ... infirmities healed, youth restored, longevity extended, vision and hearing expanded, and mental telepathy comes
- women find painless childbirth, equal status
- Messiah-Prince is not Jesus, but his representative
- wonderful celestial Prince Melchizedek (Jesus' representative) was here 4000 years ago
- transcendental prophets, apostles, martyrs return for 1000 years
- Family of God unites religions in cooperation.

In the process of anyone acquainted with this 'message of good news' coming to a 'final decision' they must of necessity approach it via only one of two means, either:

[1] believe it is true and doing so ultimately because they don't have first hand and direct insight into the truth or fallacy of the matter; such lack of first hand insight forcing them into a position of having to believe in the authority they invest in Mr. Pope; or,

[2] believe it is false and doing so ultimately because they do have first hand and direct insight into the proposition put forward (which means they would have secured some form of genuine prophet-like adeptness themselves), or doing so because they clearly recognize that the structure of the whole proposition simply lacks reasonableness and logic (which means they would have a clear understanding of _The URANTIA Book_, Biblical
and relevant scriptures from which Mr. Pope has drawn his own deductions which amount to the nature of his mission and gospel), or doing so because they clearly recognize that Mr. Pope's vantage point is lacking in genuine spiritual perspective (which means that they recognize in Mr. Pope psychological and fledgling spiritual thinking which they themselves have long since encountered, spiritized and outgrown ... a process which would enable them to see his proposition from a greater sense of realness and God-knowing than he himself).

Obviously there are a tremendous number of people in the first camp: those who will believe in Mr. Pope and his authority, those whose spiritual lives are sufficiently empty of genuine nourishment that they must believe him lest they find nothing in life from which to draw their 'daily bread', those for whom spiritual life must somehow engage them in extraordinary and cosmic adventures above and beyond the natural and normal quietly proceeding growth of their morontia values within their earthy and humble surrounds, those who are new to _The URANTIA Book_ and find themselves hanging on every word of their elders without any practical means to discriminate wisely ... especially since few newcomers would ever suspect wolves among the flock.

Equally obviously there are people in the other camp also: people who refuse to believe because they refuse to listen to the message from the outset; people who disbelieve because of a deep inner conviction that Mr. Pope is wrong, despite their inability to put their rationale into words; people who wait quietly merged with the superior insight derived from Truth and our indwelling Father's presence, and who claim their decision to disbelieve Mr. Pope because from such a vantage point he is clearly deluding himself; people who refuse to believe because the issue contains no spiritual value whatsoever.

From the perspective of this author it is clear that any argument against Mr. Pope's proposition (and it is that he is a third Elijah prophet on a mission from God plus that of his actual gospel) can have two thrusts, both self qualifying and self authorizing. They are:

[1] expose the errors (and they are numerous to say the least) on Mr. Pope's deductive reasoning by contesting his use of the scriptural and URANTIA Book references and the meanings and conclusions he ascribes them

[2] expose his lack of prophetic authority, his lack of genuine spiritual insight, and the non-spiritual nature of his ideas.

The case for [1] would entail a mammoth literary work which far outdistances the average person's needs. For example, to deal with the Old Testament references alone would require the reader to undergo thorough familiarization with much of Hebrew theological thought, the origins of that thought as it evolved over the centuries, insight into the precise circumstances within which period the Testament was experienced and documented by those people native to it ... etc. etc. It becomes far simpler for the average enquirer to simply believe or disbelieve based on their emotional response to the matter, ignoring the weighty intellectual evidence: and people do just that. But those people who are thinkers, who will bother to think it all through, who do want to research the facts and who do want to discover the many inconsistencies and misinterpretations of Mr. Pope's theological resources will be well rewarded. Any URANTIA Book reader who has also pursued Biblical or Rabbinical theological studies at a university level can attest to that.

The case for [2] is a whole different matter from [1] and less easy of providing public evidence to one whose genuine spiritual maturity is still youthful. Invariably someone who is struggling to come to their 'final decision' and whose spiritual maturity is still somewhat youthful will look in faith to an authority in this camp or that camp. The only criteria such a person has to call on is often only a faint and seemingly authority-less hunch about the truth in either prospective authority. These are infants trusting in the truth and love of their elder sibling: shall it be to the wolf or the lamb that they entrust their young heart?

A secondary and perhaps more important issue is the “so what” of this whole matter. What's the difference if Mr. Pope is Elijah 3rd and the world comes to an inglorious end and an elite group are transported to some temporary haven ... or if he's just Mr. Pope, and the oak tree in the garden today will be the same one there when you're 86 and arthritis ridden?

At a casual glance it might not mean all that much at all. But look more closely. What about the new reader who comes to _The URANTIA Book_ via Mr. Pope's tapes, and reads the entire book through the tinted glasses of expecting the world to end shortly? What about the anti-URANTIA Book fundamentalist who takes the tapes to press for public exposure to the general and unenlightened masses? What about the young enquirer of good and pure heart who comes upon _The URANTIA Book_ and whose spirit thrives until they come upon the main body of readers who are embroiled in division and diversion and extraordinary claims? What shall become of the sanctity and preservation of this most highly valued (by thousands of people) literary work and its role in the lives of generations yet to come?

Another issue is more personal and focuses upon our spiritual growth itself. There exist people who are so very familiar with _The URANTIA Book_ that it is no longer a support, a crutch, an indispensable part of the spiritual life. Their ministry is no longer to encourage people to read the book, to study the book, to incorporate the book into their spiritual lives. Rather their ministry is to do what it says, to do what Jesus said to do, and to do what they themselves have discovered and claimed as their own to be the only real spiritual life there is: to serve this wonderful and extraordinary family with a truth-liberating love and tireless enthusiasm irrespective of circumstances and the material conditions within which they find themselves.

It is only in the spiritual perspectives of such people that the error and foolishress of Mr. Pope's proposition is illuminated. These men and women are the spiritual adepts of the URANTIA reading community. In the light of their perspective it is clear that the “so what” of this proposition directly affects the spiritual growth of people. Yet they would say:

“Believe first in your heavenly Father who dwells within...not some mere mortal who establishes himself as an intercessor, for there are no intercessors between you and God: your relationship is direct and immediate, now and eternally.”

“Believe not in those things which you might derive from the kingdom, rather believe in those things which you personally might contribute to it.”

“Believe not that the kingdom of heaven is a worldly and material matter, rather believe that the kingdom is being a God-knowing Son and Daughter and it is that grace-filled fellowship between all such Sons and Daughters.”

“Believe not in the salvation of the body and of those things which shall pass away, rather believe in the eternal life of your soul and its inevitable fusion with our Father.”

“Believe not in the leadings of the deductions and calculations of the mortal mind with all its hopes and its fears and its separation from the One living source of life and truth, rather believe in devoted and divine caring which quietly whispers 'This is the Way' and believe in the leading which leads your soul rather than that which leads your fear-prone and short-sighted logical mind.”

“Believe in faith rather than clever deductions and logic.”

“Believe in yourself and your spiritual sovereignty and your own truth and your own sense of goodness and beauty, rather than in authorities which exist outside your own intimate relationship with your divine indwelling Father, and rather that in mortal heroes and those who would wave banners in support of themselves.”

“Believe in Truth: it thunders through your whole being, though your young soul may not yet discern it as much as you might wish.”

This author believes he does not stand alone in this refuting of Mr. Pope and his pseudo-prophetic claims. He doubts that this present document shall stand alone in this quest. He also doubts that others of like mind shall be slow in forthcoming with their own individual perspective to reinforce the support of “good news to a distracted world”. If this author can be of any assistance with your questions as you bring yourself to your own 'final decision' please address them to 88 Alma Road St Kilda, Vic. 3182 including a stamped, self-addressed envelope.

## Back-Packing From Melbourne To Sydney

_Supplement to Six-0-Six, VBH 3740, vol 11 No 6, Nov/Dec 1990_

(FEBRUARY — APRIL 1990)

Eight years ago, my life was saved by triple bypass heart surgery.

In February this year I retired — and decided in gratitude to raise money for the National Heart Foundation. I also wanted to encourage people to be physically active after a heart operation — because I believe that a little bit of attention to the food we eat, combined with suitable physical activity is the best assurance for a healthy life.

So my idea was born; to walk back packing, from Melbourne to Sydney, a distance of approximately 1200 ~km.

I took the train from Sydney to Melbourne, with my pack, all keen to start the walk. I was lucky to have a son in Melbourne, who gave me lodging for a couple of days and help with the final preparations.

The weather and the pack were going to be my greatest problems. Many people asked "What do you carry in your pack? So, before proceeding — let's take a look.

A tent, (my home for the next 64 days). Sleeping bag and blow-up pillow; clothing for hot weather plus additional warm clothing for the mountains including underwear, socks, singlets, etc. raincoat and rain trousers, towel and washing gear. Everything for preparation of food, such as camping stove, liquid fuel, cooking pots, as well as basic food for at least two days, with plates and cutlery to suit. Then a mixture of items such as: water bottle, first aid kit, fly repellant, sun screen lotion, torch, note book, small radio, a book to read, plus a number of minor items.

The story that follows tells some of my thoughts, feelings and observations, during the walk back to Sydney. Initially despair and doubt — then decision to carry on — and finally arriving, 64 days later at Sydney — Royal National Park, with sore feet and muscles, but rewarded by the memory of many inspiring events.

_February 25, Sunday — Start of the walk_

My son stopped his car outside Melbourne. “Here you are and good luck”. My walk to Sydney was to start. For some time to come, I and nature will share intimate experiences. What will they be? Unpredictable for sure only time will tell. Like getting married, for better or for worse.

_February 26, Monday_

The heat wave — the humidity, the weight of the pack, make me doubt. Will I make it? Did I make a wrong decision? With all this sweat, only 50 ~km so far. Difficult to even imagine the distance and the difficulties, all the way to Sydney.

_February 27, Tuesday — Flowerdale_

Last night in the forest was different. Everything dripping wet, tall trees shedding condensation — had me fooled all night it was rain. But rain with a difference. Big, Big drops — like blobs. Could count each one as they broke against the tent.

Morning hid the trees in fog. Morning became noon, before I was sure it really was a new day.

_February 28, Wednesday — Yea_

Away from the humidity and heat wave, I drop my pack on the floor, in a typical country store.

Storekeeper: “And where are you off to?”

Me: “Walking to Sydney.”

Storekeeper with disbelieving stare:

“Not with that pack.”

By now I think he is right.....

_March 1 — Yark Area_

Blisters — big ones, small ones, how could one get so many blisters? Must be the humidity and the sweat keeping everything wet. Skin turns pale and peels off. Fresh skin red and sore is what remains.

Laying exhausted in my tent I get cramp in my legs. Feels like my muscle tendons would snap. I have never experienced this before. Guess it's due to heat and continuous exertion.

_March 2_

Takes longer to get started. Each rest prolongs the agony of getting going. Dull pain in muscles. Sharp pain in feet. What else can be done to blisters — but more band aids? Found out what caused my cramp. Not enough salt in my food.

_March 3_

My body is objecting. “Make pack lighter or no walk” The last “good to have, but not absolutely necessary items” are packed in a box and sent home.

_March 4_

I remember someone telling me “No matter how much you prepare, you must allow at least a week to settle in”. The thought gives me hope, let's give it some more time and then — rethink.

_March 5 — Mansfield area_

Not always easy to find a camping site. Last night a small water hole, not far from the road, was the choice.

Put up my tent on the only flat ground — on the access path to the water. Darkness came with agitated sounds — noises from stamping, hissing creatures. Was it wild pigs, was it wombats, snakes, rabbits, kangaroos? I just listened, could hear my heart beating until too tired and fell asleep.

Lesson: Be careful with access to water holes they can be congested.

_March 6 — Tolmie_

Lo and behold — a 'settling in process' is in progress but not yet complete.

Many band-aids have fallen off, and some not replaced. But

- my shoulders — my back — my legs, much more settling in is required.

Thinking, deciding — “Keep on, give it a go”

_March 7 — Whitfield Area_

Inspired by the beauty of nature, I feel light and happy. Could nearly fly with pack and all. In my mind a thought is born — it must be through us, the Maker appreciates His work. “How else”?

_March 8 — Cheshunt_

It can only happen in the movies, you will say, but here it was for real. During the heat of the day a car came past and pulled off the road in front of me. A man stepped out with a bottle of wine and two glasses in his hands. There stood my friend I hadn't seen for many years. In the shade we enjoyed the wine, talked about old times, new times, until it was time to part.

_March 9 — Dandongadale_

Walking on a winding forest road, I hear a rumble — then the road trembles. A log truck is approaching in a cloud of dust. Majestic — awesome, with noise and power. For a while nothing can be seen but dust, until settled — then shapes of grass, bushes, ghostly trees appear — all in grey. My eyes are getting gritty. Feels as if they need windscreen wipers.

_March 11 — Mt Buffalo District_

Glorious country all around me. As I walk I enjoy the smells of hay, eucalyptus, pines, and even cattle dung. Suddenly a sweet fragrance, as if a lady passed by. I turn my head, but no one there. Did I expect a miracle in the heat, or was it just old habit?

_March 12 — Myrtleford_

My hat — nothing fancy, just what is common in the bush. I soak the hat in water, put it on to soak my head. How practical this invention to keep you cool in the heat.

_March 17 — Tallangatta_

This morning the duck shooting started with a blasting from at least 100 guns.. It sounded as if a banana republic changed government — lots of shooting accompanied by squeaking ducks. This morning came with death to at least a thousand ducks — just in this Tallangatta area — 10 birds per day being the quota for each hunter. waking up in my tent at the shore of Lake Hume — I could sense the agony of terrified ducks and other birds. This morning — no happy singing or chatter in the trees.

Later this day — walking to a creek to fill my water bottle, at a distance I could see many heaps of feathers on the bank of the creek. Poking around — 10 duck heads — 20 feet plus wings and feathers in each heap; the only things left of some beautiful ducks.

Living so close to nature during my walk — the sight was saddening — it brought tears to my eyes.

_March 18 — Koetong_

Last night I slept in a pine forest. The hissing sound of the wind through the trees was different to the sound in a typical native forest. Before falling asleep I listened longer than usual to the sounds outside my tent. A harmony is created by the sounds in a forest — I felt at home and at peace, but any discord immediately drew my attention.

_March 20 — Corryong_

Someone once complained “We have lost our pioneering spirit”. If by a pioneering spirit we mean the attitude “Let's give it a go” even if the odds are against us — then I have good news.

My impression from many isolated country areas. “Pioneers are still around”. People living in caravans, in tents, or huts, whilst building a home and establishing their farm. But, in these isolated areas, how strong must love be to keep young couples together.

_March 22_

Here I am, at the halfway mark, crossing the bridge over river Murray, the border between Victoria and New South Wales. This calls for celebration; no champagne, so the river water will do. Sitting down to rest and reflect on the occasion.

No gates, no guards, no requests for passport at this border. How lucky we are in this country. Free to travel, without restrictions, we just take it too much for granted and never really give it a thought, nor the appreciation it deserves.

_March 23 Khancoban — Snowy Mountain Area_

Water — how little we city people understand the importance of water.

For some of us, thirst is made only for beer or coca-cola. But here water is required, and no pubs, no shops at hand. In this drought stricken area, no running creeks, no clean water holes, just an occasional mud hole for animals their life dependent upon it.

How was I to get water? I took some risks and learnt the lessons.

My problem was the distance between towns or major rivers sometimes the distance was too long to carry water, enough to quench my thirst.

First my lips dried out — then my tongue and throat difficult to swallow, to talk, until I completely lost my voice.

Then minor miracles came to the rescue. A farm with water tanks, or a truck with a water bag, or a water hole, clean enough to share with some animals.

Have you ever been thirsty — really thirsty for some time? Your body dries up like a wettex left in the sun. Imagine that you come to a river. You jump flat in the water — to feel it all around you — you drink and drink — your body absorbs water from the inside and from outside. After drinking as much as you can, you still feel thirsty it takes a while for each cell in the body to absorb all the water they needs.

Coming closer to the Snowy Mountains, farmers were praying for rain. “Hold it”, I said, “wait until I get over the mountains”. I might get washed away and the rain in the mountains is cold.

_March 26 — Thredbo Area_

Once over the Snowy Mountains the rain came. No more water shortage but now different problems.

My timetable required me to walk every day — rain or shine. No chance of getting anything dried. The pack got heavier, filled with wet clothing, sleeping bag and tent. putting up the tent in the rain had to be fast to avoid leaches.

Once inside the tent with the zipper drawn, the leaches marched up and down on the outside — looking for somewhere to get in. I had the opportunity to study their behaviour — perfectly adapted to detect my presence, even from a distance.

_March 27 — Jindabyne_

How unpredictable the weather. Lake Jindabyne was calm and beautiful. I put up my tent on it's sloping shore to enjoy the sunset and the reflections from the lake. Night and darkness came with a warning. Lightning crossed the sky. Then a gust of wind stirred the lake. Not long thereafter a storm hit the lake, the shore and my tent. Nothing around to brake the fury of the storm. Pegs gave away and collapsed the tent.

Nowhere to escape — there I was, inside the flapping tent afraid to be blown away. I rolled and wrapped the tent around me which by now started to fill with water. The night became a battle against the wind, the rain and the cold with everything thoroughly wet.

Just before dawn, a sudden stillness. A few stars could be seen. Then the sun came up so bright as if apologising for the hardship during the night.

_March 29 Berridale_

Going to sleep at sunset meant waking up before sunrise. That gave me time to listen to the moods and feelings of birds and creatures waking up in the forest. Magpies — my favourite birds were always the first to sing. Then the Kookaburras and much later all the rest.

_April 2 — Brown Mountains — East of Nimmitabel_

We pay for our mistakes. To lighten my pack I got rid of my warm clothing in Cooma. That was my mistake. On the way to the coast in the forest, on top of the Brown Mountain, it was raining and cold. No use searching for a dry camping spot. At times like this I was glad that my tent had a waterproof floor. Once inside the tent — with all clothing wet and the sleeping bag moist and feeling slimy, how was I to get warm? Shivering I wrapped myself in the sleeping bag and tired from a long day's walk, I fell asleep. Half dry in the morning I was surprised at the warmth retained by my bag. During many days of rain I was to experience many similar nights.

How come I did not get sick, -no flu, -not even a common cold.

_April 4 — Bega District_

I do make some people happy — it works like this. When I explain to strangers about my walk — there is a moment of silence. They view me up and down.

“Walking to Sydney — and with that Pack, we always thought that driving from Melbourne to Sydney is far enough — but walking — thank God it's not us.” Their faces light up — happy in the thought that they don't have to do it, and perhaps realising their life is not that hard after all.

_April 6 — Cobargo Area_

On the shore of a beautiful river I put up my tent. It was sunset when I was ready. Sat inside the tent, facing the entry making notes in my diary. Suddenly I heard scratching noises behind my back — I turned my head — and saw the tent moving. Then a dingo came to the front stopped and motionless we stared at each other. Thoughts of Ayers Rock flashed through my mind. This dingo — just a bundle of muscles — a golden, beautiful creature to watch. In his face and expression I could read his thoughts. “Don't blame me — I did not do anything” then he turned away and half ran up the bank.

Now a second dingo came from behind the tent and stopped in front of me. I know, one dingo is one thing, but two are unpredictable. He stared at me from only two arm lengths away and I stared back without a move. Whilst looking at his mate a few meters away, I could understand his thoughts. “Why run away — what about the food we could smell in the tent — shouldn't we go and get it?” When no answer from his mate, he decided to follow. I sat still, watching until they disappeared over the bank. I got out from the tent, selected a strong stick and put my smelly sandwiches in my pack.

Opened the blade on my swiss pen knife, determined to fight off any intruder. This night — not much sleep — the lightest of noise called for attention and disturbed by $m y$ thoughts without answers. The two dingoes — could they have been farm dogs? But no farms around — and they certainly looked like dingoes.

_April 10 — Moruya Area_

My pack — always too heavy, easy to throw on my back in the morning, but towards the end of the day, always a surprise — what a struggle to get it on my back.

Last night in my dream I made a discovery. I dug deep into my pack and there under all my stuff was a bag full of concrete. How did it get there? Could not figure it out. But with relief and great satisfaction I threw it away.

In the morning — the lingering dream satisfaction and expectation of a lighter pack soon evaporated — like the dew in the morning sun.

_April 14 — Ulla Dulla_

Someone asked — “Don't you get lonely walking all by yourself?” The question surprised me because to be lonely had never occurred to me. Every day came with new and different experiences — no time to be lonely, and after a while my thoughts and nature itself became my company.

But nights were different. Imagination was intensified by darkness and by being alone. It took some time to feel at ease, with the sounds one hears in the stillness. — All alone in a dark forest.

_April 17, Nowra_

Radio, Television and the local newspapers did a good job to inform the locals about my walk. Many drivers stopped their car to have a chat and give a donation.

“You must be the person walking for the National Heart Foundation” “Good on you”.

- and then they often told a story about their family, relatives or friends. It left me with a deep appreciation of how common heart problems are, even amongst country people — people we so often think of, as really super strong and healthy.

Visited many country hospitals for a chat with staff and patients, and to gain support for the Heart Foundation.

My impressions from these visits.

Everyone troubled over hospital funding, but matrons, nurses and hospital staff, how kind and concerned for my safety and well-being. I was impressed by many of the hospitals — nice and inviting places. Forgive my occasional thoughts; “How good it would be to be sick just for a little while, to sleep in a real bed instead of in the tent on some hard rocky ground............”

_April 21 — Wollongong_

If I were a judge of the “DO THE RIGHT THING” competition, I would nominate Victoria as the winner. The roads, highways and byways are clean — even the approaches to country towns and the towns themselves. The same cannot be said about New South Wales, the lack of rest areas with bins conveniently located for motorists to use could be one of the problems.

DO THE RIGHT THING" has been a very successful campaign but more planning and care is required in New South Wales.

_April 27 — Coledale_

My walk is soon coming to an end. My legs and shoulder muscles are aching but with admiration I think of my body. What a marvellous design, to accept so much abuse. Not a job by an apprentice.

All credit to our Maker. A professional engineer I can't but wonder — “What was the design specification?”

During my walk, many cars and trucks stopped to offer me a lift. I felt guilty to decline, but my pledge was to walk all the way, any transport to be accepted only in an emergency.

It took some explaining, and some found it hard to believe that I really could refuse their offer.

_April 29 — Royal National Park_

This glorious Sunday was to be the last day of my walk. at Audley friends had gathered for a welcome. My thoughts went back to the many good people I met along the way. They turned up just at the right time with water, a cup of tea, offer of shelter etc. or just a friendly chat with encouragement appropriate at the time.

How much lighter even my pack became — just by a few encouraging words.

My thanks to you all — I like to think of you as “angels in disguise”
