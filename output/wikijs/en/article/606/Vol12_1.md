> “A human being can find truth in his inner experience, but he needs a Clear knowledge of facts to apply his personal discovery of truth to the ruthlessly practical demands of everyday life.” ([UB 111:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_7))



## A Note From Six-O-Six

_I would like to welcome everyone back after our summer holiday break. More than ever we need to strengthen our ties around the world in that bond of Brotherhood, to strengthen our faith and maintain that inner peace which passes all understanding to neutralize the negativity that surrounds our planet._

### No Brainwashing

I would like to make a comment on the article in the November/December issue of 6-0-6 by Norm Du Val$ from Montana. While I concede that he has a very valid point in chiding both Ann Bendall and myself for speaking out against the E-3 tapes without listening to them, I must say in our defence that it must not be overlooked that there was extensive literature, describing the content of the tapes, enclosed with the newsletter which prompted our responses. Surely any literature describing a product is designed to whet the appetites of prospective buyers and I'm afraid this literature failed miserably. It did not even prompt a “maybe” in my view; in fact it said enough to give me cause to reject it. One must also take into account that if we were to read and listen to every message that every self-proclaimed prophet announced, we may never find time to study _The URANTIA Book_. So no, Norm, I have no fear of being brainwashed. If the E-3 message was of significant spiritual value I feel sure his descriptive literature of the content of the tapes would have prompted me to give them a hearing.

Thank you to Robert Crickett for his article “Coming to a 'Final Decision”'. He obviously has given the tapes a hearing and I appreciate his conclusions.

**Kathleen Swadling, Sydney**

---

_Editor's Note_

_To set the record straight, I would like to point out that Robert Cricket, according to my source of information, which was the person who played the tapes for him, listened to excerpts of 3 (out of 5) of the tapes. He made a draft of his article on the same day, finished writing it and posted it to me on the next day._

_There are telltale signs of this when he says “... an elite group are transported to some temporary haven ...”_

_As one reader pointed out: “Two billion people is an elite group? And the only entrance requirement is a sincere belief in God? How elite can that be?”_

_This same reader also remarks that Robert's paragraph beginning “The case for [1] would entail a mammoth literary work ...” and which ends “...theological studies at a university level can attest to that.” rather reminded him of the pharisees TELLING Jesus what the scriptures mean. He continues: “I an sure many prophets have been told ‘what the scriptures really mean’ by many learned scholars and thinkers.”_

_Several readers made the remark that Robert's case to come to a final decision certainly did not bring them any closer and that in fact no one was provoked to come to any decision, only to keep an open mind._

_Although Robert took neither the time nor the trouble to discuss with any of the people who had taken a much longer period of time to evaluate E-3's message and what their motivations were to take it seriously, yet took it upon himself to sit in judgment on them. I'll be the first one to admit to spiritual immaturity, but cannot help but wonder whether the superior tone of some of his statements would not bring a smile to the faces of our celestial friends. As _The URANTIA Book_ says, to a greater or lesser degree, we've all got it wrong anyway!_

_To assume that readers are being divided into two camps over this issue is a bit far-fetched. Australian readers are far too sensible for that. They know that the Father expresses Himself through many different channels, but underneath it all spiritually WE ARE ONE._

### A Word On Belief

Beliefs are always of a personal nature and in my opinion should remain so (this is not to say that some aspects of a “belief” cannot be shared). If what one believes is to themselves the truth — then so be it, however this does not mean that it is truth for anyone else. The same incident seen through several eyes is always reported differently. Beliefs are arrived at by a highly complex structure including education, background, perceptions, interpretations, intuitiveness, personality quirks etc. I see it as folly to take on board another person's beliefs, not only is this lazy but it negates all of the above elements required to reach a personal (which can be aligned with other's) belief.

I have listened to all of the E-3 tapes and have done some research of my own based on his interpretations of biblical and URANTIA Book events and using my own complex structure I come to a totally different conclusion. This being so I defend your right to pass on or publish anything you feel may be of interest to your readers.

### Keep It Up!

Today I received your November/December issue and read it through.

This was an excellent edition. I especially liked the article/reprint of Les Sheridan's analysis of the left and right brain. It made me think — and feel.

Through these trying times of the URANTIA movement, your work serves to bridge the old and the new, the Fellowship and the Foundation, those for Joe and those against. I find it personally stimulating that you present us with intellectually articulate information and mix in the news and humour for levity.

Thank you for your work. Keep it up.

### Spiritual Unity

We spent the end of the year with Urs and Nicole Ruchti in Switzerland. We had a good time, reading papers from Jesus' life This was uplifting and inspiring.

We read with great interest the Six-O-Six and we see with pleasure that the Australian readers are not in an intellectual uniformity but surely in spiritual unity.

Continue your good work with good courage and we love you all.

Your sister and brother...

### Modern Prophets

The last issues of 6-0-6 dealt substantially with the subject of Joe Pope's message. Over here in America, we were aware of this message before Joe discovered he had a fax-line with the higher ET powers of heaven. I am not joking, because, personally I am sure that our communication lines with the spiritual tutors, are in fact more sophisticated than we can express with our material words.

Ernest Moyer of Pennsylvania, had written some papers before Joe did, on the same subject. And, someone by the name of Michael X 20 years ago, has written quite a lot on the subject of evacuation. Michael advised people to keep developing FAITH, stay calm and ready, since the heavenly rescuing parties knew full well who we are and where we are. This Michael must have been a student of the book.

The Fifth Epochal Revelation, p. 582 has been the spark of these three cases just mentioned. But Michael X is also inspired by a passage of the book where it is said that on normal planets, most ascenders that have known the third stage of light anchorage, have to accept some kind of compensating duty, before leaving a local universe and switch into spirit form. I read Michael X some twenty years ago, but an enormous lot of accelerated events have taken place of late, and I could not have another look at those scripts since I keep giving those things away. I am busy scrutinizing the 2000 pages of the Blue Book. This book is like a huge library that no one can afford to go through, since it has the kaleidoscopic power, of revealing its input channels.

I personally do not believe that Providence would use in 1990, the type of prophets that were accommodating the world over 2500 years ago. I believe that Luther acted as a prophet 500 years ago. I believe that writers like Dickens and Hugo, with their keen sense of communication, were acting as precursors of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, and that Pope John the XXIII was most prophetic by his honest world-wide call for an inquiry into the deep secret lairs of our Christian faith, for finding some ways of spiritual renewal. God knows the art of marketing so much better than us human pee-wees we all are.

I receive over 20 Bulletins printed by our URANTIA groups. Some others had a rather short life. They will survive in as much as they improve gradually their conveying power and can help create a better sense of togetherness. We are all together, no doubt, but each one with his personal kind of togetherness. We all try to amplify our thinking, our talking, and it takes such a long time before we reach the art of fine-tuning.

_Editor's Note_

_I know of a few more revelations by extraterrestrials which tell us that the likelihood of an evacuation of this planet is great if we keep on going the way we are. They also tell us that this solar system, even the universe is in for a quantum leap in consciousness very soon. Urantia has been out of step for too long and it is effecting our whole system. We are not an island on our own but part of a larger creation. And they have been rather patient with us. However they all tell us there is nothing to fear if we have faith in God. I have also heard that the celestials are not particularly overjoyed with the performance of the URANTIA movement of late, but then one can't believe everything one hears. Why take any notice of anything that has come through since 1934? As long as we keep on reading those 2000 pages of the blue book “we'll be right, mate!” as we Aussies are prone to say._

_With this last remark, I'm not trying to have a go at you, Gerard. It just shows the human side of my nature, which sometimes becomes a bit frustrated with the ATTITUDE of the URANTIA movement in general, some factions of which seem to be more pre-occupied with organizational structures then the more important things at hand and that is the coming of the Sons of God. Those glorious Beings of Light who are with us on the planet right now. But none are so blind as those that will not see!_

_I believe that Joe is just one of many, includingyourself, who are here at this time to do a particular job and until we learn to unify and pull in the same direction the task of our Elder Brothers will be so much more difficult._

### New Planetary Prince!

Announcement

June 1, 1990 AD

Dear Friends,

Those of you who have done your homework and diligently studied the FIFTH EPOCHAL REVELATION to the evolving races of your planet will better understand and grasp the significance of the following announcement. For those of you who have not done your homework and studied _The URANTIA Book_ I will briefly explain the announcement to you.

It is important to understand the following activities of Machiventa, one of the twelve Melchizedek Receivers who came here to “secure” the planet at the time of the Luciferian Rebellion. (Actually, these Receivers were here twice as they left upon the arrival of Adam and Eve and returned at the time of the Adamic default.)

MACHIVENTA MELCHIZEDEK, YOUR NEW PLANETARY PRINCE.

When MICHAEL OF NEBADON incarnated here as Jesus, he did of course accomplish many things. One thing he did was to confront Caligastia, the then Planetary Prince, and remove him from his position as Spiritual Ruler of this Planet, the spiritual name of which is URANTIA. Caligastia is who many believe to be “SATAN” or the “DEVIL” but this is not so (by name at least) as BOTH Lucifer AND Satan were removed from their System Stations to a Prison World. Caligastia, however, though shorn of his powers, was allowed to remain on the Planet.

> “_Upon Michael's becoming the settled head of the universe of Nebadon, Lucifer was taken into custody by the agents of the Uversa Ancients of Days and has since been a prisoner of satellite number one of the Father's group of the transition spheres of Jerusem._” ([UB 53:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_2))

> “_Satan was allowed to make periodic visits to the apostate princes on the fallen worlds until another Son of God should be accepted by such apostate worlds, or until such time as the courts of Uversa should begin the adjudication of the case of Gabriel vs. Lucifer._” ([UB 53:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_3))

> “_It is true that Satan did periodically visit Caligastia and others of the fallen princes right up to the time of the presentation of these revelations [the URANTIA REVELATIONS], when there occurred the first hearing of Gabriel's plea for the annihilation of the archrebels. Satan is now unqualifiedly detained on the Jerusem prison worlds._” ([UB 53:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p9_4))

After the Rebellion took place, the Melchizedek Receivers worked principally with and through Van, an associate of Caligastia who remained loyal to Michael, and Amadon, his human counterpart. These two remained on the planet and taught truth for over 150,000 years until the arrival of Adam and Eve.

In 1973 BC there occurred the THIRD EPOCHAL REVELATION to the people of your Planet. (The FIRST epochal revelation was the arrival of Caligastia; the SECOND was Adam and Eve; the THIRD **Machiventa Melchizedek** the FOURTH Michael/Jesus and the FIFTH IS THE URANTIA BOOK). Machiventa incarnated “in the likeness of human flesh” as a full grown male and was here 94 years earth time. He did not age and left as suddenly as he appeared. This time he worked DIRECTLY with ABRAHAM, the “Father of the Jews”. Abraham, now an Ascended Master, is working through a Human Agent at the present time on your planet.

> “_This same Melchizedek continued to collaborate throughout the nineteen succeeding centuries with the many prophets and seers, thus endeavouring to keep alive the truths of [his] Salem [teachings] until the fullness of the time for Michael's [Jesus'] appearance on earth._” (1024:6)

> “_Machiventa continued as a planetary receiver up to the times of the triumph of Michael [Jesus] on Urantia. Subsequently, he was attached to the Urantia service on Jerusem [the System Capital] as one of the four and twenty directors, only just recently having been elevated to the position of personal ambassador on Jerusem of the Creator Son, bearing the title VICEGERENT PLANETARY PRINCE OF URANTIA. It is our belief that, as long as Urantia remains an inhabited planet, Machiventa Melchizedek will not be fully returned to the duties of his order of sonship but will remain, speaking in the terms of time, forever a planetary minister representing Christ Michael [Jesus]. 
> 
> As his was an emergency bestowal on Urantia, it does not appear from the records what Machiventa's future may be. It may develop that the Melchizedek corps of Nebadon have sustained the permanent loss of one of their number. Recent rulings handed down from the Most Highs of Edentia, and later confirmed by the Ancients of Days of Uversa, strongly suggest that this bestowal Melchizedek is destined to take the place of the fallen Planetary Prince, Caligastia. If our conjectures in this respect are correct, it is altogether possible that Machiventa Melchizedek may again appear in person on Urantia and in some modified manner resume the role of the dethroned Planetary Prince ..._” ([UB 93:10.5-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_5))

> “_We well understand how, by his triumph on Urantia, Michael became the successor of both Caligastia and Adam; how he became the planetary Prince of Peace and the second Adam._” ([UB 93:10.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_7))

> “_It has long been the opinion of our order that Machiventa's presence on the Jerusem corps of Urantia directors, the four and twenty counselors, [Lao-tse is also a member of this council] is sufficient evidence to warrant the belief that he is destined to follow the mortals of Urantia on through the universe scheme of progression and ascension even to the Paradise Corps of the Finality._” ([UB 93:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_9))

> “_Less than a thousand years ago this same Machiventa Melchizedek, the onetime sage of Salem, was invisibly present on Urantia for a period of one hundred years, acting as resident governor general of the planet ..._” ([UB 93:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_10))

The second time these twelve Receivers were here some of them worked directly through “HUMAN AGENTS” or “MATERIAL COMPLIMENTS”, humans who were conscious of this arrangement (which was the sixth century BC) and among these humans was Lao-tse. Lao-tse was in such a state of consciousness he could dematerialize his body and allow MACHIVENTA MELCHIZEDEK to appear and share this vehicle with him. Machiventa being the Melchizedek who honoured Lao-tse in this way.

As previously mentioned, it has been thought by many that since Machiventa was Vicegerent Planetary Prince that sooner or later he would be elevated to the position of Planetary Prince.

In December, 1989 AD, MACHIVENTA APPEARED through Sananda's Light Body and announced that since the new Spiritual Planetary Government had been assigned he had, indeed, become the new Spiritual Ruler of your Planet, appointed by Michael/Jesus, Creator of your Universe of Nebadon. He also announced that since Lao-tse had been his Material Agent before and since Lao-tse is the Ascended Master who has been using the Light Body of Sananda and APPEARING/MANIFESTING through him for almost a quarter of a century in this life cycle, both he, Machiventa and Lao-tse, will be working through Sananda on a multidimensional basis. In a recent session with Lao-tse, the FUSION of Lao-tse's Light Body with Sananda's Light Body was witnessed which means a PROCESS has been completed after many years (and lifetimes) of initiations to the point where Sananda becomes invisible and Laotse's Light Body manifests through the shared vehicle.

Therefore, the JOYFUL ANNOUNCEMENT is that you have a new PLANETARY PRINCE, MACHIVENTA MELCHIZEDEK, as well as an Ambassador, Sananda Lao-tse Melchizedek, through which both he and the Ascended Master Lao-tse will VISIBLY function on the rapidly increasing frequency of the Earth Planet Urantia.

(For further information on the above refer to _The URANTIA Book_ and “THE LIGHT BODY” tape by Sananda explaining the process by which an Ascended Master may APPEAR through a human “channel”.)

### Caligastia's Visit!

August 18, 1990
PCL COMMUNIQUE

Caligastia's Visit to the Planetary Center of Light

About 2:45 PM, Saturday, August 11, 1990 we noticed a profound energy change. At precisely 3 PM Caligastia's spaceship anchored directly above the PLANETARY CENTER OF LIGHT accompanied by an appropriate Light Escort. (There is a Starship anchored over this area.) The thunder and energy bursts (like lightning) were stunning. When the CONTACT between Caligastia's ship and the PCL was made everything went off... electricity stopped. There were bursts of “lightning” both outside and INSIDE the room. In a quick series of three energy bursts Caligastia was in the room. For almost four hours there was a Hierarchy meeting here which had to do with the surrender of Caligastia the purpose of which was to prevent further waste such as the bloodshed of the prime stock of Urantians lined up in the Middle East for massacre/sacrifice.

Among the various reasons that event occurred here is that the PLANETARY CENTER OF LIGHT is exactly that. In addition, my appointment as Ambassador for the Planetary Prince, Machiventa Melchizedek, has placed us in the active position of being the Embassy for the New Planetary Spiritual Government. As you know, Embassies are usually neutral ground where often even enemies or their representatives meet and Ambassadors try to solve problems diplomatically. Furthermore, since I first came to Urantia WITH Caligastia when he was appointed Planetary Prince and had a VERY long relationship with him that began with friendship and admiration, my part of the meeting was to APPEAL to him, along with others who were present, to SURRENDER NOW. He well knows he has lost and that there is little time left and we all tried to convince him that he should LEAVE NOW with at least the dignity of a Lanonandek which he still is in spite of the death and destruction he has helped perpetuate since he joined Lucifer and Satan and took Urantia into the terrible Rebellion which has ended in the heavens.

Caligastia did not make a commitment before he left the meeting so we cannot, at this time, tell you what HIS personal decision was but we do believe he has been taken into custody and removed to the Father's Prison World to wait annihilation. This change may not reflect for a while on the 3-D level for the Rebellion, obviously, still has to be settled on the human/earth plane. However, his REMOVAL will clear the way for rapid progression on the Spiritual level including for any of you who are truly working on behalf of Jesus/Michael.

### Statement Of Intent

I, Machiventa Melchizedek, Vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia make this statement:

God intends for me to make ready the peoples inhabiting the Planet Urantia for the arrival of Prince Michael, Son of God.

This work as Vicegerent consists of gathering those persons who do hear, who do see, who do understand GOD. This gathering of persons shall eventually spread light, truth, love throughout humankind.

I used the term “Correcting time”, this terminology has been coined to give humankind some indication of the intent. To correct something is to alter course. This alteration of course may take some considerable time/space in your terms. There is no way a time frame can be allocated for this. It is dependent entirely on individual humankind acceptance and understanding.

I shall be working with the co-operation of certain chosen persons. This communication is being delivered through one such. There are others, and there may be others, also dependent again on humankind acceptance and understanding, never forgetting the freewill of humankind.

Abraham is “used” by myself as a “scouting party” and in turn I am “used” thus. We make ready.

This is my Statement of Intent.

Thank you.

## A Message From Gabriel

To All Our Beloved Creations Walking On The Beautiful Planet Earth:

It is with Joy in my heart and jubilation on my lips that I am once again The Harbinger elect who bears Good News to Mankind.

I, GABRIEL, Arch-Angel of the Realm, have indeed glad tidings to convey. Humanity has turned the corner at last, after Centuries of Darkness and unenlightened thought, and at last is headed for the Light, walking, no, actually running together on the path back to God, our beloved Creator.

Daily new progress is made and all those Souls who have dragged behind and hindered this progress — so dear to our hearts — have also surged forward and requested the help of the Christ.

At long last they also saw fit to change their minds and no longer walk in isolation with their eyes fixed firmly on the material substance, but have now included others in their view of life. Even the animals have taken on a new lease and are eager to improve their own awareness, following, as usual, in your footsteps.

Help in spiritual awareness and daily individual guidance is sought increasingly so, even if not with full consciousness by some, but always on a deeper unaware level. This can be increased individually and in the groupconsciousness in the nightly sleep-teachings, in which now all — and I mean all — without exception, participate. Due to the big “break-through” which occurred in December 1990, due to the earnest appeal by one of you, to turn to Christ for help, a floodgate seemed to open, and masses of former unhappy and desolate Souls, who had lost their way, surged forward to claim their birthright of the Light.

This simple interceptive request was made with purity of compassion and thus spoke to the hearts of all of those, who carried their burdens unaided. This is no longer so, you all share each other's lives, as it indeed should be, for all Mankind is created as ONE.

From that very day in December a new spiritual Age was opened and the spiritual “Age of Radiance” commenced. The physical one had begun in May 1990 already, when we begun to infuse the Planet with daily increasing doses of higher vibrational frequencies. These harmonically more beneficial infusions will gradually be stepped up and increasingly be felt by everyone alike. At this stage, only those of you with extra sensitivity have noticed the difference and responded well, to our delight.

So in every sense the year 1990 was of the greatest historical importance, since the “Fall” of awareness aeons of years ago, when the Planet was physically bombarded with adversity, not by intention but due to careless applications of the power of the “dark Ray”. I hasten to assure you that this happened once only and prior to being inhabited by Mankind as you know it, in the very early period of this Planet.

Never since that brief time has there ever been another intervention of this nature before, nor will there ever be on this Planet or any other.

So be assured you need not to fight “evil” forever, as it does not exist but in the mind of man.

When you cease your nebulous fight against a phantom-force, you will no longer see evil established around you in your fellow men and at last can relax your guard and openly embrace your Brothers and Sisters of all Races, of all ages, as being “AT ONE” with yourself.

This new Unity will lead quickly to the everlasting Peace proclaimed so often by lip-service as yet — to be sure — but now it can take on a new meaning.

The message I proclaimed at the birth of Jesus the Christ, which ended with “Peace and Goodwill to all Mankind” will at last be heard with open minds and hearts and can be fulfilled, now that all of Mankind has turned once again to God, the Omnific Presence.

We of the Hierarchy are overjoyed with the events which have taken place so rapidly and will increasingly be felt physically and mentally alike, now that the spiritual progress has truly begun to take effect.

It is with a new urgency that I say: Reconcile your differences and begin to plan for a true World-Government, elected with great care, not to represent sections of the community or those Races of religious beliefs, but purely on the basis of ability, integrity and pureness of heart. Include the young, who have come with superior knowledge in many fields of service, who have, in fact volunteered to be embodied at this time of need.

When planning anything, be it the sharing of your resources, or scientific knowledge to redress the ills of the polluted Earth, make certain the other three kingdoms, those of the Animals, Plants and Minerals are duly considered at all time, for they have equal rights to be here as has Mankind. When due considerations are paid to the whole, the whole Planet will prosper and thrive and the “Paradisical Conditions” promised will become a speedy reality, not in the dim future, but within the next decade.

Due to the events in 1990, time is put forward, indeed! So no longer look with hope to the distant future, but work towards it with great vigour and unity and the confidence that this is all possible now.

We foresee nothing but Abundance on every level, as soon as you no longer work for yourself, but assist each other truly without ulterior motives of rulership or gain.

Have complete FAITH that this will come to pass, as it is decreed that it will, and so it does!

On behalf of my Fellow Angelic Beings and those of the Avatar-level of the Hierarchy, I pledge our assistance in your recovery or wakening to the Truth about yourself: You are as God created you: PERFECT! So let this Perfection shine forth and extend too all you think and do. Discard old guilt-feelings of inadequacies imposed, they do not exist — all is well! So except your love to God in return and give thanks that this is so.

I remain, as the “Keeper of Truth” GABRIEL, ArchAngel of the Realm, and thank my trusted Channel in Brisbane, Australia, for being given the opportunity to relay this glad tidings to you all.

[This message was received on Tuesday, the first of January 1991]

And when you die you are purple
And you've got the nerve to call he coloured!.

What a 36 page Tenth Anniversary Issue wasn't able to do, my article “From E.T. to E-3” apparently was, and that is, evoke a response!

My remark on not wanting to turn into a URANTIA Book fundamentalist was not meant as a personal accusation against anyone, but rather as a warning for the whole readership, including myself, about the ATTITUDE of the fundamentalist that nothing shall be added.

If however anyone feels that the shoe fits, then so be it. I have no argument with the beliefs of the fundamentalist or anyone else's beliefs for that matter. It would be foolish to do so. Doesn't _The URANTIA Book_ tell us on page 1260 that to a greater or lesser degree we've all got it wrong anyway?

However experience has shown me what the attitude of the fundamentalist can lead to. Like this true story where a fundamentalist said to a “non-believer”: “You realize of course that you won't go to heaven”.

It is an attitude that Jesus repeatedly warned us about. It is an attitude that can lead to prejudice or making hasty judgments before we've properly studied all the facts. You probably know that the book mentions

“The chief inhibitors of growth are prejudice and ignorance”. (1094)

It is an attitude that can also lead to the crystallization of truth. It can lead to feelings of self-righteousness, religious arrogance and intolerance. These are the attitudes that have led to every religious war. Because one party believes to be one cut above the other party. And when I see these attitudes creeping into the URANTIA movement then I feel it is time to take an honest look at ourselves and hopefully grow a bit in the process.

With a marvellous revelation like _The URANTIA Book_ it is easy enough to feel so smug that we think we do not need to look at anything else. I've been guilty of that myself at times! Even _The URANTIA Book_ is only a stepping stone, a scaffolding to NEVER-ENDING HEIGHTS OF NEW TRUTHS.

Jesus said: “Happy are the poor in spirit — the humble”. In my books that means being open-minded, teachable, seeking truth wherever it may come from. In our hurry to shoot the messenger, let us not make the mistake of overlooking the message. Let us not forget Jesus' words: “Divine truth must not be discounted because the channel of its bestowal is apparently human”. One cannot judge a book by its cover, neither can one pass judgment on a message that takes at least 7 and a half hours to listen to by just looking at a few pamphlets, which I feel are probably more aimed at the American culture than the Australian one, and also at a non-URANTIA Book reading public. I do understand scepticism, but let us not be close-minded about it. Every person has the Spirit of Truth working if we give it a chance.

Kathleen's remark about life on Graceland “as a bed of roses”.

When one listens to the tapes, one realizes that these are just the conditions on a normal planet, one that isn't as backward as Urantia. No wonder the book says:

> “_If you could be transported from your backward and confused world to some normal planet now in the postbestowal Son age, you would think you had been transplanted to the heaven of your traditions._” ([UB 52:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_8))

Her remark about being on guard with E-3's claim of being the fulfilment of the prophecy of another and greater John the Baptist.

I wholeheartedly agree with her. But on the other hand I also feel that we should be careful with having preconceived ideas about him. Our criteria may not be God's criteria. Because of the uniqueness of every personality we inevitably run into trouble if we have certain expectations. Somehow I don't think it is a good idea to say: “God, please send us another prophet, because I've looked at these lousy pamphlets and I don't think this prophet measures up to my expectations”.

I do not know whether E-3 is the promised prophet _The URANTIA Book_ and the Bible speak of. He could be deluded that he is. But what I do know is that he is a son of the Father and that the Father loves him as much as he loves me. I believe that no matter who he was, he would have an extremely hard time trying to convince his fellow man that he was a genuine prophet. I feel personally that I am of more help to him and the rest of the world if firstly I pray for him and secondly if I dare to honestly and objectively look at his message and then try and evaluate it before condemning it altogether without even listening.

In the section that deals with the material handicaps of the Adjuster, the book tells us that the Adjuster's ministry is greatly retarded by our own “preconceived opinions, settledideas, and long-standing prejudices”. And they advise us:

> “_Therefore, in scrutinizing mental situations, safety lies only in the prompt recognition of each and every thought and experience for just what it actually and fundamentally is, disregarding entirely what it might have been_”. ([UB 109:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_3))

Kathleen's remark about E-3's use of Jesus' saying “The harvest is plentiful, but the labourers are few”, it is interesting how different people react in different ways to the same situations. There is a group of people who took Jesus' saying “Happy are the pure in heart” and the comment about not being suspicious to heart. After the understandable initial scepticism they, despite those lousy pamphlets, slightly reluctantly at first, listened to the message. Not once, but several times. They also studied the book “The End of the World! And the Coming of the Bestowal Son”, which, as the author admits, has some errors in it, but still is an intensive study of quotations of _The URANTIA Book_ and the Bible on the subject. And after a period of vacillating between belief and disbelief they looked at the state of the world and started reasoning something like this — This possibly could happen. We don't know if it will happen, but if it does happen then it is also up to us to make something happen. And they offered their help in case it does happen to spread this message of faith in God and deliverance to a public who may not be aware of their spiritual security that we feel we've got. Not because they feel less loyal to the teachings of our beloved blue book, not because they see this message as a replacement for the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_, but more as an emergency measure meant for emergency times. With Jesus they say:

> “_The downfall of nations, the crash of empires, the destruction of the unbelieving Jews, the end of an age, even the end of the world, what have these things to do with one who believes this gospel, and who has hid his life in the surety of the eternal kingdom?_” ([UB 176:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_2))

If the world does come to a temporary end, we may not need to know about Graceland, but there will be a lot of frightened people out there who don't have _The URANTIA Book_, nor will be ready for it, but could very well be ready for the GRACELAND tapes, which reveal all those fundamental beliefs Kathleen writes about in her article, which could be a great help in alleviating their fears.

There are single supporting parents on a pension in this group, who cannot afford to give financial assistance. Yet they offered their support, their time and energy. That is how these people reacted to that saying about the harvest is plentiful. They did something positive and organised themselves so that they would be ready to step in if and when it happens. You could see it as being service-minded. (I am not implying that I think Kathleen is not service-minded., because we all know very well that she is.) They felt this messagecould have been given to us first to give us time to jump over that hurdle of disbelief and then give us the opportunity of offering our services as the labourers the Master would undoubtedly be looking for. But we do all remain agondonters who apparently have to fatten on sublime uncertainty.

However they feel that we all have a responsibility to keep _The URANTIA Book_ untainted and free from any individual's personal interpretation and that's why this group has decided that it is wisest to keep the two separated. They are aware that the URANTIA Foundation could not endorse this message.

But I would like to thank everyone for their responses. I admire you all for speaking up for your beliefs and your great loyalty towards the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_. As long as we keep discussing our viewpoints without anyone getting upset, we've got a healthy situation. And please remember that anything that I have said in this reply is not meant personally. I just feel that we should have a honest look at this whole situation and solve it as best we know how to before it gets out of hand and irreparable damage is done to the cause we all feel dedicated to and that is the spreading of The Fifth Epochal Revelation to a planet which more than ever needs it. Although we may not agree on this matter, spiritually WE ARE ONE. Didn't Jesus say: “When did I teach you that you should all see alike?” ([UB 141:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p5_1)) Let's hope we all can learn something from this.

By the way, did you know that even the finaliters love to speculate about the future and that even these glorified beings don't agree on the subject? ([UB 31:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/31#p7_3))

As the soft, brilliant clouds gather in the sky at sunset, so are My Forces gathering for the sunset of the old order of affairs. The clouds are gathering in a glory of the cosmic colours, so are those forces gathering in a glory of Cosmic Pover.

And so even as you watch the change from brilliant day to star lit night, calmly and without fear, even so shall you watch from your haven of My Love, the changes which are taking place in My Universe. For a tine, to those who understand not, it will seem that the light is fading and that darkness shall surely cover the land But to My Children, those who know their Unity with the Father ofall, shall come a quiet peace and they shall know that after the seeming darkness, the Sun of Righteousness shail surely ise again with healing in His Wings the old order of sin, disease, nans hatred of man, and all the train of evil which follows, shall be no nore. but only P ace, love and Righteousness shall be recog? nized as the reality of all things ponder this message. Few are read to receive it now but by y o ur conscrons knowing you nay on in the great a wakening of the New Bay which is ol hand.

## A Reincarnation Explanation

**From: THE CIRCLES Winter 1990**

_The URANTIA Book_ states that human beings do not reincarnate, yet many religions teach reincarnation. There are also many books about reincarnation, many of which include personal accounts of earlier lives remembered.

Before I became acquainted with _The URANTIA Book_, I read many books on Eastern and Western religions, mysticism, and materials which are now labeled “New Age”. When I found _The URANTIA Book_, I lost interest in them for the bits and pieces of truth that I found in them could not compare to the feast that I found in _The URANTIA Book_. I have never questioned the book's truth, and I have enjoyed matching our expanding knowledge of geology, science, space, and even my own religious experience with _The URANTIA Book_. When human knowledge does not comply with the book, I normally await further expansion of human knowledge.

I have, however, been perplexed at the beliefs and writings about reincarnation, in contrast to the book's flat statement that there is no reincarnation. _The URANTIA Book_ does state that many things had been left unexplained about what really happens at death.

After I learned to communicate with my angel, I eventually asked about this discrepancy. I was told that mind intellect systems are used over and over, but have no vitality outside of human beings. The way I understand it, I am using a mind intellect system which was used by individuals who lived prior to me. I am in possession of it now, but when I die, it will be used by another. The Father has endowed me with personality, and in partnership with my Adjuster and with the help of my angel, I am using this temporary intellect system to create an eternal soul.

I found this concept hard to grasp. To leave “myself” behind upon death, yet be far away and totally uninterested in the “self” left behind! And furthermore, this same “left behind self” would be used by another man or woman to create another soul — whom I could meet on my eternal career, even as I could meet glorified mortals whose earthly “mind” I had used.

Naturally I was interested in my “previous lives”. I questioned my angel about several of them and felt humble when I learned something of their spiritual accomplishments and courage. As I learned about my “heritage”, I began to understand why, even as a child, I had quested for spirituality, and why, as a young person, I felt that there should be more to religion than what I experienced myself or saw in the established church. I also understood why newly selected Adjusters spend the time between selection and actual indwelling studying the subject of their indwelling. 

One night during the period that I was researching the subject, I awoke with a profound conviction that the mind intellect system used by my father had become the possession of a new human being. The vision and knowledge of this newborn child was so vivid that I immediately accepted it as a fact and have never doubted it since. I recently queried my angel about the child's status, but she simply informed me that he was a healthy toddler.

I have never read the explanation for reincarnation which I have just given you. Certainly reincarnation, as it is usually taught, is not an attractive existence. What good is it to have lived before if one doesn't remember it? Descriptions of existence “between lives”, as described in channeling, automatic writing, and other, means are hazy, ambiguous, and inconsistent. If we view temporary intellect systems as being a part of the Divine Minister and/or a part of the evolving Supreme, we can accept their resuscitation without fanfare. As I became used to the idea, I realized more intensely that this earthly life was my life, that I am a unique human being living for the first time, and that life on the next level is a continuation of this life, not an infantile beginning. I found that I was not interested in learning more about the individuals who used the temporary intellect system which I am using, nor was I interested in what happens to the intellect system between lives. I simply accepted the fact that the temporary mind system that I am using has its own evolution, and I can never be a part of it after I leave it behind.

## He Who Has Ears To Hear

It is already six months down the track since the publication of my article “From E.T. to E-3”. Since that time I have received a lot of information, sometimes direct, sometimes indirect about messages from our unseen friends, which have come through various channels.

Instead of becoming sidetracked by concentrating on the personalities of these channels, I have carefully read them, listened to them and tried to evaluate them to the best of my ability. And it is amazing how they dovetail! New vistas have opened up. A gigantic cosmic plan is slowly being revealed.

As editor of Six-O-Six, I feel I would fail in my duty if I did not pass this information on. Neil Francey and Tony Rudd, my co-editors, also are of the same opinion. We give you this information and leave it to the Spirit of Truth within you to guide you in whether you want to accept it or not.

Quite a few readers may already have heard or read it, but others may not. As there is far too much material to publish in one newsletter, I'll make a list and anyone who wants to follow it up, can either write to me or ring me on (03) 561-6089.

## A Tale Of Two Ants

Two ants, Brilly and Ignor, were standing together on their tennis ball one day, having one of their regular philosophical discussions.

Ignor claimed triumphantly: “I reckon I've discovered infinity!”

“How's that?” asked Brilly.

“Well, you know what infinity is, don't you? It's something that goes on and on and on and no matter how hard you try, you never get to the end”, Ignor explained.

“Go on.”

"Well, I figure that if I walk in a straight line across this green furry world of ours, I can walk for ever and ever and never get to the end. I'd never go backwards, always forwards, always at a constant speed, deviating neither left not right. I could walk forever, an infinite distance", he concluded.

Brilly didn't agree.

“I think you'd end up exactly where you started. And to really throw you a ”curved ball“, I also predict that you would always go through exactly the same spot at the halfway mark of any trip back to where you started.”

“Piffle”, retorted Ignor, “I still think I'd get to infinity. I told you, I'd always be going forwards, so how could I possibly end up where I started?”

Brilly explained: “Well it's like this. We're both on a thing called a ball, and it's spherical, which means that it's discreetly located in time and space. It has clearly defined limits, and hence no matter how far you walk, you are no closer to infinity after you've walked yourself to exhaustion, as you were when you started. Understanding about spheres as I do gives me the confidence to predict exactly where you'll end up”.

“It sounds weird to me”, Ignor replied.

“It just depends on your perspective”, explained Brilly as Ignor slowly ambled off, muttering and shaking his head.

_Editor's Note_

_Inspired by the joy, the love and the peace present on a hill at East Warburton, where we could almost touch the clouds, Elfie wrote this beautiful piece after our group meditation on one of those crisp mornings during the last conference._

## A Visit Home

I slip between morning sun and bird song
To the quiet of the sky.
“Whereto little traveller?”
“A visit home my Lord — oh please!”
“Your work is not complete.”
“Yes I know — a few moments only, this I need.”
“Go then, but quick.”
And quick I went, as fast as thought,
To a distant star
In Orion's mighty belt.
And words cannot describe the joy
Of a welcome by “US ALL”.
Straight to the heart of the fire,
Touched by each mind flame.
Here no need of words
Communion is a music
Too subtle for our ears to hear.
A semitone describes a day's events,
A chord the mystery of a dark abyss,
And a symphony tells a journey
To the planet Earth,
With all her strange complexities
Of taste and touch
And human love,
Oh God, dare I return!
