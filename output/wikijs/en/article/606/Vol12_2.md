_Six-O-Six is a bi-monthly publication dedicated to promote international good will and understanding between readers of The URANTIA Book_

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “_Reason is the proof of science, faith the proof of religion, logic the proof of philosophy, but revelation is validated only by human experience._” ([UB 101:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p2_8))

## Six-O-Six Review

_As readers of Six-O-Six may have noticed, over the past few issues the range of articles has covered a broader scope than previously. Some agree with this, and some don't. My co-editor, Neil Francey, disagrees and wrote his thoughts down as follows:_

“A publication representing readers of _The URANTIA Book_ is offered enormous scope for content. The explicit nature of that book's pronouncements however, further implies that constraints may also be imposed. A well-balanced mix of opposing points of view on a wide variety of issues with an even-handed editorial approach has come to be the expectation of readers of this journal.”

“It appears that Six-0-Six has in recent issues weighted its articles and editorial comments to a particular interest group and away from a strict URANTIA Book discipline. Readers are now having to address a new direction. Is this publication continuing to assist readers evaluate new ideas providing greater insights and understanding? Is it meeting changing needs? As a result, is Six-0-Six enjoying and increasing appreciation by readers or is it becoming too general?”

“Madeline and I have discussed these matters in detail. We believe it is important to do so from time to time. At present, we differ.”

“We even considered forming two distinct publications, each with independent editorial control. In this way we would have pursued topics we each considered important. This though may have become divisive. So at this time we continue to recognize our opposing points of view and the current situation prevails.”

“As co-publisher of Six-0-Six, I wish to independently raise the issue of reviewing this publication.”

“In the latter part of 1985 , with an expanded format, I saw the need and opportunity to involve others in its production. The main responsibility for continuity was graciously accepted by Madeline.”

“Since that time, the workload has increased particularly with the overseas mailing list.”

“The problem of long-term viability for the publication still exists as it is even today primarily dependent on Madeline's superb efforts. And we have the ongoing question of the most appropriate editorial policy to represent ever changing times.”

“Is it relevant or even advisable for Madeline now to be given support by the newly formed readers association mentioned elsewhere in this issue? An autonomous editorial board affiliated with the association may feel it can contribute to a more unified approach.”

“It is imperative that Six-O-Six maintain the high reputation and integrity that it has come to enjoy around the world.”

_I have discussed the whole issue with the “third member” of our team, Tony Rudd, and we have developed an approach which we feel should make everybody happy. You will notice that this issue of Six-O-Six is structured differently to other issues. We have included a “Part 2”. We have chosen to put into the main section all issues that relate directly to _The URANTIA Book_, including readers' personal experiences, comments or observations, plus the normal poems, crosswords etc. This is more or less the same content pattern that existed in earlier times. We have then assembled all other material that addresses broader issues into Part 2._

_Any reader who wants only the traditional material should write to Six-O-Six and ask that only the first section be sent._

_I would like to point out that it has always been the policy of Six-O-Six to publish readers' contributions with the minimum of editing. Over the years we have decided not to publish only a few readers' contributions. Where this has happened, it has only been after consultation between editors._

_We would like all our readers, including our overseas friends, to have a say in this new approach as well and are looking forward to your comments._

### Congratulations Six-0-Six

I congratulate you on having the courage to print Six-0-Six's recent editions containing some challenging articles. The second last paragraph of Madeline's article “We're Talking About Attitudes”:

“... But I would like to thank everyone for their responses. I admire you all for speaking up for your beliefs and your great loyalty towards the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_. As long as we keep discussing our viewpoints without anyone getting upset, we've got a healthy situation ...” allows someone to share ideas without another feeling attacked.

Other articles from Sananda have been around for some time. In the early 1970's I regularly received newsletters from the Planetary Center of Light and various other groups on other continents.

Benjamin Creme (United Kingdom) was in Melbourne during January 1991 . For the past 15 years he has been talking about the return of the Christ energy, “the Age of Maitreya”.

There are numerous groups with channelled messages from various celestial beings and also from many not so celestial beings.

The coming years are likely to spawn many more messages through different mediums, requiring each person to test their own truth and be open in their attitude, sharing life with others' opinions and cultural differences.

Stimulating also was the article “A Reincarnation Explanation” by Carol Davidson, reprinted from THE CIRCLES, Winter 1991.

“... mind intellect systems are used over and over, but have no vitality outside of human beings. ... I am using a mind intellect system which was used by individuals who lived prior to me.”

I too found many discrepancies with the theory of reincarnation. Twenty years ago however I read many books on Buddhism, Theosophy, Alice Bailey etc. and the reincarnation aspect explained the discrepancies that existed in my Christian upbringing. Over the past few years I've been faced with putting aside belief structures and theories and admitting there is just so much that my intellect does not comprehend and it's OK not to have a pigeon hole or a handle to hang on to. Ten or twenty years ago my intellect could not embrace the message by Carol's angel. Now however after many years working with computers and recently programming with UNIX and computer language, my consciousness can embrace her angel's description and it opens up many insights.

Thank you, Six-0-Six.

**Ian Esmore, Melbourne**

### “The Light Body”

I thank you for offering me the opportunity to listen to and assess the content of the various tapes mentioned in the last issue of Six-0-Six (I do not refer to the Elijah the Third tapes, which I have not heard).

I was particularly impressed with “The Light Body” tape and found myself playing it over and over again and the more I listened, the more convinced I became of the truth of its message. Maybe I am being misguided or gullible, but I can see no great harm arising from the acceptance of these beliefs as truth other than perhaps one of disappointment if they fail to be true.

If, as _The URANTIA Book_ states, that our planet Earth at some time in the future is to be restored to the spiritual circuits and broadcasts of the realm and has already a circuit and divisional headquarters of Archangels ([UB 114:7.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_16)) on the planet, then surely it's not too improbable or far-fetched to believe in the messages (recorded on tape) that earth's vibratory frequencies are at present being upstepped to higher vibratory frequencies in order to take us into the higher fourth dimension. We have definitely been told that this will take place at some stage in our evolutionary development. So why not now?

If these messages do prove to be revelatory, then we must now be approaching the “Promise of the Ages” — the time of the “Golden Age” — or as _The URANTIA Book_ refers to it, the era of “Light and Life”.

My very special thanks to you, Madeline, for giving me the chance to listen to these tapes.

**Nancy Dempster, Melbourne**

_I would like to correct an error I made in the last issue of Six-0-Six. “The Light Body” tape is Sananda's personal experience and is NOT as previously mentioned material from “The Keys Of Enoch”._

### In Defence Of UB Fundamentalism

Fair go, Madeline! You've left the rails. Kathleen Swadling and Robert Crickett don't have closed minds. It's just that those of us who have experienced “the end of the world” a few times know that we don't really need to listen to the E-3 tapes to have a fair idea of what's in them. I haven't actually taken a count of the number of groups currently prophesying the imminent end of the world, but if it's any less than fifty I'd be surprised. It's quite impossible to give detailed attention to them all. I've examined enough of them to be able to assert with confidence that although they're all different, they're all the same too!

Robert's reasoned analysis and Kathleen's cry of indignation were both right on target. Many of us who believe _The URANTIA Book_ to be what it claims to be have lived through episodes of breathless expectancy where we look to direct superhuman involvement in the world's affairs to solve a 'crisis', or extract us from a mess of our own making. It's heady stuff. It makes us feel so **significant**. But disappointment has taught us to be wary of such excitement, and to heed the warnings which the book itself contains, about human proclivity for self-deception. The whole point about _The URANTIA Book_ is that it pointedly eschews such dramatic predictions and repeatedly warns us about the mistakes we make by allowing ourselves to be excited by the expectation of paranormal events.

_The URANTIA Book_ steels us for the long haul, the slow evolution of mankind to the point where we can co-operate intelligently with the celestial administrators. And this is to be achieved by uplifting ordinary everyday life through increasing consciousness of God.

Millenarianism always increases as a century draws to an end, and the end of the 20th Century is, after all, also the end of the second millennium. There are bound to be many weird and dramatic notions and fancies put about over the next nine years.

Let's not be distracted by them.

**William Wentworth, Towamba, N.S.W.**

_I would first like to reply to the comment made in your personal note to me in relation to this article: 'You won't like it". You should know me better than that, William! I enjoy having a discussion between loyal friends, which I know we are. And I intend to continue with it if you allow me to 'hit a few more nails on the head' as one reader called it._

_I think any discerning reader would by now have recognized that this controversy is not about “the end of the world”, or about E-3 or about the Graceland Tapes, they were just catalysts. This is about PREJUDICE and INTOLERANCE. As one reader wrote to me recently “too many readers are turning _The URANTIA Book_ into a new religion”._

_Don't you think that the Master is not only looking for people who can study and interpret _The URANTIA Book_, but when it comes to the crunch bring it into practice by having love and respect for their fellow men and his/her religious experiences? If someone wanted to sow the seeds of dissension among us it would not be our belief systems that would pull us through, but those much talked about fruits of the spirit. Are we to become hollow vessels or living branches on the vine?_

_I have tried to avoid becoming personal, but since you've brought it up, yes, I've left the rails. It happened when as a 17 year old girl. I left my Catholic parental home. My 88 year old mother is still concerned about it and wonders if I will ever make it to her heaven. But I know that in the many Mansions of our Father's House there is room for ALL. And I am not afraid to stand by my previous statement that I do not want to become a URANTIA Book fundamentalist. (I feel I have explained myself well enough in the last issue what I mean by that.) My understanding of the section in _The URANTIA Book_ on the Spirit of Truth is that the book itself teaches against the very idea of fundamentalism! Not only do I see myself as an Urantian, but as a member of a vast cosmic family._

### Concerned

We in the Auckland study group have become increasingly concerned about the recent articles in Six-OSix on channelling, and the editorial responses to letters and articles on this subject.

We wish to make it publicly known that we do not support this trend. We have enjoyed receiving the Six-OSix in the past because we found it informative and inspirational. However, recent issues seem to indicate that the aims of the publication are no longer to “promote international goodwill and understanding between readers of _The URANTIA Book_”, as stated.

We hope that future issues of the magazine will return to these objectives.

For Auckland Urantia Book Study Group...

**Marion Steward, Auckland, New Zealand**

_Dear friends across the Tasman,_

_I do understand your concern. We are living in times of great changes all over the planet which can cause confusion. However, the important thing to remember in all this is that we are growing TOGETHER and that we respect the God in each and every one of us._

_You may find it helpful to read on [UB 159:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_1) under the section “The Strange Preacher” what Jesus said to John about these things and what his attitude was._

_Can you also not see that had it not been for a 'channel' we would not be sitting here talking to each other for there would be no URANTIA Book and no Six-O-Six?_

_That the Six-O-Six is dedicated to promoting international goodwill and understanding between readers of _The URANTIA Book_ is undoubtedly true, but that doesn't exclude anyone._

_These things are happening to URANTIA Book readers and non-URANTIA Book readers alike and they want to share their experiences with us. Who am I to deny them that right?_

_Doesn't _The URANTIA Book_ tell us:_

> “_While your religion is a matter of personal experience, it is most important that you should be exposed to the knowledge of a vast number of other religious experiences (the diverse interpretations of other and diverse mortals) to the end that you may prevent your religious life from becoming egocentric — circumscribed, selfish, and unsocial._” ([UB 103:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p1_3))

_Do I accept everything they are saying? Nol But God gave me three wonderful gifts to check it out with. The gift from the Father — the Thought Adjuster, the gift from the Son — the Spirit of Truth, and the gift from the Spirit — the Adjutant Mind Spirits._

_One of the urgent ‘messages’ that seems to be coming through nearly every ‘channel’ is the need for us to meditate daily and with a group weekly. I think ‘channel’ or no ‘channel’ that is darn good advice!_

_How many of us URANTIA Book readers can honestly say that we spend at least 15 to 20 minutes a day, every day, just doing that?_

_That you publicly not want to be seen associated with the other New Zealand group in Hamilton has been noted._

_From the reactions I have received to the articles and editorial responses you are referring to I know that some people love them some people hate them and others are sitting on the fence, watching which way the chips are going to fall._

_But when I read through the stack of letters I find that the positive reactions far outweigh the negative ones._

_As they say — “You can't please ALL the people ALL the time.”_

_We all have a right to express our opinion and that includes the editor I hope._

_In this issue we have tried to come up with a solution that should keep everyone happy._

### The Number Of Our Planet

I highly commend the editor for her courage to publish her article in the last Six-0-Six — “We're Talking About Attitudes” — and also for publishing some of the messages we are now receiving from various sources. She has obviously recognized that the number 6-0-6 is the number of our planet and not a code number for _The URANTIA Book_. That is the reason there should be no restrictions on the publishing of messages relating to this planet. What could be more important in this point of time than the survival of Urantia?

**Willi Summers, Perth**

### The Six Commandments

We all know the Ten Commandments. But here are the six for the future of this planet. I found them in a book called “Cosmic Revelation”, by Ann Valentin and Virginia Essene.

Planetary Commandments

It is time for you to relate to all that is and to be in harmony with all.

1. Revere the God force in all things.
2. Honour the Universe and all created matter in it.
3. Honour and respect all lifeforms — not just human, here and beyond Earth.
4. Honour your physical planet.
5. Honour the space around your planet and beyond.
6. Put no destructive devices in space.

**Loui de Keizer, Melbourne**

### Christ In You

“Christ in you, the Hope of Glory” has been picking and pecking, trying to pick His way out of materialism, out of the shell of mortal limitation, that you might hatch out, a Child of the Living God. It is indeed wonderful! The Seed-Idea of Life has been implanted in the Soil of your Souls. If you will bring your bodies into subjection, you will be going through that process which typifies the incubating process, and after a while the CHRIST will develop in you.

**Contributed by Leith Luckett, Melbourne**

### No More Books!

Dear Fellow URANTIA Book Reader,

Thank you for ordering URANTIA Books from the Good Cheer Press. I sadly inform you that Good Cheer Press, along with every other URANTIA Book distributor, secular and non-secular, can no longer buy URANTIA Books. URANTIA Foundation has shut off the supply of URANTIA Books to bookstore distributors and mail-order houses across the land. The major distributors have been told _The URANTIA Book_ is 'out of stock', which means there must be another printing before books will be available, when in reality there are more than 20,000 URANTIA Books in storage at the printer's warehouse. URANTIA Foundation continues to claim they are shipping books to book distributors. We call every distributor twice a week and can assure you URANTIA Foundation has shut off sales.

We do have a few books on hand and will continue to sell them, one to a customer, until they are all gone.

What does the shutdown of _The URANTIA Book_s to book distributors mean to you? Virtually all URANTIA Books sell through distributors. Unless URANTIA Foundation re-opens the book distributor channel, most retail bookstores, all secondary organizations, and Fellowship Societies will no longer have access to URANTIA Books. Availability of _The URANTIA Book_ will evaporate.

What can you do about the situation. I suggest the following actions:

1. Go to your local bookstore and ask for _The URANTIA Book_. The bookstore will attempt to order books from their distributor. Even though the distributor's computer will read, 'out of stock', 'out of print' or 'discontinued', keep piling up the orders from the stores to the distributors. Hopefully this will compel URANTIA Foundation to re-open the book distributor channel.
2. Please keep ordering from The Good Cheer Press. We are here to serve you and will persist until URANTIA. Books flow freely again.
3. If this situation makes you as angry and frustrated as it has me, write one or more of the Trustees and voice your opposition to their heart-breaking actions.
4. Re-commit your efforts to furthering the noble and life gracing teachings of _The URANTIA Book_!

We pray the angels will continue to fortify URANTIA Book believers. In this time when _The URANTIA Book_ is being withheld from new readers and long-time believers, more than ever we need to practice its teachings. We are sorry if we have caused you alarm, but as active readers we believe it to be our duty to inform you of this horrible situation. Jesus told us our work would not be easy but he promised to walk through the waters of adversity with us. If you are feeling discouraged by these latest developments, do not be downcast. This shall pass. As Jesus taught, be of good cheer and have faith that good always wins in the end. The heavenly Father is counting on you to help this Revelation bring love and goodwill to spiritually hungry people worldwide.

In the Spirit,

(Signed by the Director, Good Cheer Press)

**Peggy Anne Douglass, Boulder, Colorado, USA**

_This letter was passed on to me in the past month. It is dated November 1, 1990. I do not know whether this situation still exists. Maybe some of our readers in the USA can enlighten us a bit more on what is happening._

## News And Notes

### Australian Association Formed

After considerable discussion over the years amongst readers of _The URANTIA Book_, we would like to announce that an association of students of _The URANTIA Book_ within Australia has finally been formed. The initial steps of organization have now been completed, the constitution approved and adopted, a small treasury of funds gathered and a committee elected. At present there are members from the Sydney, Canberra, Brisbane and Perth areas. It is our hope that many readers of _The URANTIA Book_ in Australia will seek to support this association.

We have called the association “The Australian Association of Students of _The URANTIA Book_”

(AASUB). It functions under a constitution which ensures democratic procedures and participation on a broad level. It is a non-profit organization. One of the main objectives of our association is to support the steady spread of the revelation through undramatic, everyday means by encouraging local, informal URANTIA Book study groups. Another objective is to encourage the social interaction of readers by supporting an annual conference, a national newsletter and to facilitate contact between readers.

AASUB is purely an Australian entity, founded by Australian readers for Australia and therefore functions autonomously, independent of any other organization. Naturally, however, individuals within the association are free to associate with any other organization if they wish.

It is the intention of AASUB to assist the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_ into Australia without encumbering it with church, temple or other spiritual institutions. Although AASUB will be made up of individual religionists, it is not our intention to create in any form or manner a religious institution of any kind.

We therefore have pleasure in inviting readers of _The URANTIA Book_ to enquire about membership in AASUB. A copy of the constitution and an application for membership are available upon request. Prerequisites for membership are that the applicant has read _The URANTIA Book_ in its entirety and is sponsored by two existing members of AASUB.

For further information please contact:

Kathleen Swadling, Secretary AASUB
7 Walsh St., North Narrabeen, NSW. 2101
Phone (02) 913-7893

William Wentworth — President

## Some Personal Thoughts

I discovered _The URANTIA Book_ in 1977 while visiting a friend in Phoenix, Arizona. The Book changed my life. Until then God could not contact me through any channel that I knew. _The URANTIA Book_ became the channel for me to comprehend my relationship (sonship) with Him.

I have read the blue Book in its entirety once and parts of it many, many times. Over the years I have formed simple explanations of Urantia concepts that I only partly understand. I shall offer them to you — not as an interpretation of the truth within the Book — but as the image within my mind that I receive as I try to understand the Urantia message.

I accept that God always existed. Being a creature of time and space, the statement to my mind is illogical and cannot be true. However, it is my will to do the will of God and I believe it is His will that I accept that statement.

I believe that the physical things I can see and comprehend and the things I reason to exist and cannot comprehend can be called 'existence'. I divide 'existence' into God provoked (occupied) and emptiness. In one sentence: in emptiness nothing works — there are no senses, no will. God's occupied space is like the space inside a balloon which is in a room. Everything outside the balloon is emptiness. God is blowing up the balloon but the boundaries of the room are infinity.

If you will permit me to give God a human attribute, let me say GOD IS LONELY. God can make perfect human beings — as men can make robots. We can program a robot to say it loves us like God can create people to make them love him. For the statement to be true the robot, or created human, must have a free will in order to give truth to the statement. The ability to say “No, I don't love you” must also be programmed into a subject with the free will to say it. Without free will any statement is a tape being played.

I believe that God is in the process of surrounding himself with creatures (or whatever descriptive word you use) that keep him company of their own free will.

On Urantia the pre-creature is a human being who possesses a free will and a Thought Adjuster. The human free will and the Thought Adjuster create a soul. The merging of a Thought Adjuster and a soul can be likened to 'human conception'.

Michael, a creator son, was allowed to create precreatures such as humans. Lucifer, another order of sons, rebelled by saying that Michael's creatures were flawed and his plan, as designed and activated by Michael, needed to be changed. He actively resisted Michael's plan.

Michael's bestowal on earth was Michael's proof that a human being could achieve perfection. He came to Urantia as Jesus, allowed Lucifer to attempt to corrupt the human Jesus and Lucifer failed, thus proving to the Ancient of Days that Michael's plan works. Michael was granted full authority to proceed with his mission in Nebadon.

God invited man to join him in eternity. A part of God, the Mystery Monitor, is within most of our minds. It is our free will to accept or decline immortality. The bridge from doubt to belief in God is not built on fact or proof, it is built on faith. Once you cross the bridge of faith to the solid ground of belief one finds the 'proof' one desires.

We bring to God the gift of our uniqueness — for nowhere else in creation does the individual 'us' exist, or ever existed or ever will exist again. The reincarnation that we 'feel' has happened to us, actually means we 'feel' the past experience of our Thought Adjuster.

Some day, for many of us, shall come the time when we stand on the shores of Paradise — me, the unique individual who has emerged and mixed with the piece of God and thus are an eternal part of God, made so by our free will.

**Dealing with others**

When you are committed to freely doing the will of God you must remember, as you deal with people, that they too are the children of God and resting within each of them is a personal piece of God.

Therefore it is prudent to deal fairly with his children, for he will certainly remember any action to the contrary. 

**Prayer**

I prayed more during the part of my life when I was searching for how God could find me. Now that he has revealed himself to me through _The URANTIA Book_ I have less need for prayer. My prayers are divided. I feel the need to express my gratitude for being accepted as a son of God. I'm thankful for the Spirit of Truth which made my faith strong enough to truly believe in God. The teaching of _The URANTIA Book_ permits me to find my place in God's infinite scheme — and I am contented. I accept that Urantia is peopled by creatures of free will who, of their own free will, may choose to do me harm. I must suffer that injustice. At times I am a child who asks for favours from a Father. I believe that my Father in heaven will grant me the answer to my prayer if the granting is in my best interest.

**Who is God?**

God is everything. He is everything that is within the 'balloon'. God gives direction to his reality and that 'brain' is located in Paradise. He has created an “Eternal Son” as his face. When it is our destiny to 'see' God in Paradise, we shall gaze upon the form of the Eternal Son and see the face of God.

These are some of my thoughts on _The URANTIA Book_ which may be of interest to you and your readers.

**Edward Kendrex, Perth**

## Discussion On The Progress Of The Revelation

As a devotee to the teachings contained in _The URANTIA Book_, I am concerned about the degree of success this revelation will have in bringing about the spiritual regeneration of mankind. I am also very much aware that the degree of success is largely dependent on what the readership does with the revelation. We see the patterns of how the past epochal revelations fitted in with the evolutionary progress of mankind as we study the URANTIA Papers. Those patterns show that a portion of the existing population received a concentrated dose of the truth, then went into the world to live it, preach it or do whatever they felt inclined to do and these actions determined the flavour or the course for the new epochal era. Evolution eventually took over and truth fragmented into cultural interpretations and societies progressed accordingly. Once given, it was up to man to determine the course. When mankind was ready, another revelation was given to serve as an upstep, then evolution continued on. It is slow, subtle and gradual. We are the recipients of the fifth concentrated dose of truth. What are we to do with it?

As individuals, our lives may have been transformed to varying degrees, we attempt to live up to the teaching as best as we can, we interact with our fellow man in family, social or working circles. Each individual unconsciously bears his own fruit according to his or her level of understanding, development, maturity and sincerity. It happens slowly and naturally.

As readers band together in groups, the situation takes on a different dimension. As soon as individuals get together you have the potential for a social problem. However that should be no reason to avoid getting together for on UB 28:5.14 of _The URANTIA Book_ it says:

> “One of the most important lessons to be learned during your mortal career is **teamwork**.” (Emphasis U.B.'s [UB 28:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_14))

The spheres of perfection are manned by those who have mastered this art of working with other beings. Few are the duties in the universe for “the lone servant.”

So it's going to take us all the way to Paradise before we have mastered the art of working together — we are just on the bottom rung! So it's only natural and highly probable that when we decide on how to proceed with the revelation, there will be conflicts and differing points of view.

There are two prominent opposing points of view (with varying shades of grey in between) I see happening within the URANTIA movement around the globe which I would like to attempt to discuss and analyse in this article.

The first one I like to refer to as the conservative approach. This approach would like to keep _The URANTIA Book_ low key and for it to be spread by slow personto-person contact and for many, many study groups to grow at the grass roots level as individuals grow in their commitment to the teachings. It is believed that the book is designed to be studied in its entirety for it to be of maximum benefit. This ensures slow, solid growth as people mature and their understanding grows through prolonged, consistent study and interaction with fellow readers. For this approach, any organizational activity should be concerned with the fostering of the study of the book and arranging for social interaction. The book should always be kept as a FIRST-HAND experience. Secondary works are promoted by individuals.

> Each individual unconsciously bears his own fruit according to his or her level of understanding, development, maturity and sincerity.

The other approach I will refer to as the more radical approach. This approach believes that _The URANTIA Book_ should be made available to as many people as possible and organizational activity should be concerned with spreading the book itself. Books are often heavily subsidised by the group so the book is cheap, a lot of second-hand material describing the book is being published and circulated, and lots of people are being 'turned on' to the book via this approach. Secondary works are promoted by the group rather than the individual. The book is often diluted to become a second-hand experience in order to attract more readers.

If we understand the significance of what is taking place, we need to analyse the wisdom of the different schools of thought. The conservative approach is slow, you do not see instant results but the growth is qualitative rather than quantitative. UB 195:9.4 of _The URANTIA Book_ states:

> “_Religion does need new leaders, spiritual men and women who will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings. If Christianity persists in neglecting its spiritual mission while it continues to busy itself with social and material problems, the spiritual renaissance must await the coming of these new teachers of Jesus' religion who will be exclusively devoted to the spiritual regeneration of men. And then will these spirit-born souls quickly supply the leadership and inspiration requisite for the social, moral, economic, and political reorganization of the world._” [UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4)

The slow, qualitative growth and maturing of individuals does not happen overnight. If the devotion to the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ is instrumental in developing new spiritual leaders, as I believe it is, then it takes time; it take years of study and commitment to understand the book fully, not to mention the attempting to live and degree of success in living the teachings in our daily lives. True leadership requires maturity and maturity requires growth and sincerity. An early mandate handed down by the revelators was that: "_The URANTIA Book_ is being given to those who are ready for it long before its worldwide mission. In the meantime thousands of study groups must be brought into existence. Thus will the book be in readiness to comfort and enlighten the peoples of the world when the battle for man's liberty is finally won and the world is once more made safe for the religion of Jesus and the freedom of mankind."

This mandate suggests to me that it is within the study group that these new spiritual leaders could emerge and it will take thousands of study groups to develop them. We don't even have many hundreds of them yet. We can argue over what is meant by “long before its time” — it could be decades or it could be centuries. At the rate we're going I think more like centuries which is not inconsistent with the patterns of evolutionary growth. The book is always warning us about hastiness. The repercussions of Lucifer's and Eve's impatience should be a lesson well learned as we read. So I see the conservative approach as being consistent with slow evolutionary growth.

However the second, more radical school of thought may produce more readers and even study groups more quickly, but what happens to the quality? Rapid growth can attract cultish type followers, immature individuals with lots of zeal and enthusiasm, but perhaps lacking in wisdom. Leaders can emerge who are charismatic or egotistical or whose motives may be questionable and the zealous followers quickly mass around these leaders and each are fed with emotional enthusiasm until all believe they are on a spiritual mission from God. Anyone who stands in their way is an agent of Caligastia or the devil. Before you know it we have a noisy, sanctimonious crowd evangelising _The URANTIA Book_ and destroying its credibility in the eyes of the world.

Recently I was discussing this topic with a fellow reader and he said _The URANTIA Book_ is like a black box with the power to self-destruct. If this book comes under the scrutiny of the public eye and the media, how will it ever stand? How do we defend it publicly? There are statements, when taken out of context, which are highly offensive. If we attempt to defend these statements we start telling the world about the book which will no doubt be ridiculed by the populous at large. If blown up by the media, _The URANTIA Book_ may be lost to the populous at large forever. We could run this risk with the radical approach. It could become just another cult, ism or religious sect. What an abominable fate for such a superb book! The long-term degree of success of the revelation may be reduced and it will be today's readership that could be responsible.

Personally I have come to the conclusion that _The URANTIA Book_ is not targeted to the general population of today's world. It is too complex and integrated and needs to be studied in its entirety in order to be understood fully. Rather the teachings contained in the book, and more importantly the teachings of Jesus, is the message the world at large is ready for. Does it not follow then that those who have embraced _The URANTIA Book_ should be more concerned with infusing the teachings into society somehow rather than turning masses of people onto _The URANTIA Book_ itself? If we are bearing the fruits of the spirit, as we should automatically be doing as we progress spiritually, then it is those fruits which will bring about the spiritual regeneration of the world. Those who are ready for _The URANTIA Book_ find it through existing readers if those readers are socially active amongst their fellow men. Once someone has found the book, then the contact with other readers through study groups etc. should be fostered as that's where growth and understanding starts happening. Providing that we sincerely attempt to apply the teachings in our daily lives and achieve some degree of success, we will grow spiritually and eventually have some impact on the spiritual progression of mankind.

One more point I would like to make about the nature of this revelation is that because it is in print it has the unique benefit of remaining a FIRST-HAND EXPERIENCE for many years to come. More people will be receiving the concentrated dose of truth for centuries to come, not just a handful in one generation as was the case with the past two revelations. So what's the hurry? It's not going to go away. People who find this book will be attracted to the fellowship of readers if that fellowship is concerning itself with the spiritual growth of the individual — nothing more, nothing less. What better way to assist the growth of the individual than by encouraging the study of _The URANTIA Book_ and the social interaction of readers and believers.

## Living With Our Cosmic Father

How often in reflection I advise
Myself: “Your Father God did make the skies”
His velvet black he flung across the heavens
And organized the universe by sevens.

The many types of being blessed with life 
Throughout extensions seeming without end 
Are cosmic citizens, reducing strife, 
Discovering each person is a friend.

Throughout the asst dark kingdoms of the skies 
The never ceasing pulse of perfect power 
Sustains the universe, though no one spies 
The Maker in creation who, each hour,

Renews the cosmos Spirit, love, and energy. 
Are sweeping through the far-flung firmament, 
Establishing new living entities, 
Intending to make clear and eminent

The many jewels of wisdom's timelessness 
Which wo increasingly can understand, 
True gens of thoughts revealed from spacelessness 
From God's infinity beyond what stands.

For more remains forever in God's mind 
To learn, to do, to give to be, to share
Than we shall ever ultimately find
While always are we in our Father's care.

So let us live with boldness and conviction, 
Remembering, each moment, God-within, 
While seeking to discover God's intentions, 
Our Boundless father and Eternal Friend.

For many are the joys of endless service, 
As pre existence breaks above the surface 
Of all that shoreless sea of what could be 
Throughout the Father's vast Infinity.

## Is God A He Or A She?

I had not realized that there was some discussion on God's sex until a few months ago, when I stumbled into a situation which I try very hard to avoid — getting into theological discussions on Our Father. From past experience I have discovered that the majority of folks who want to 'sort me out' on who God is, hold their views both strongly, blindly, irrationally and determinedly, so I switch the subject to a safer topic such as the weather.

I missed my cue, when a rather inebriated man censured me on my concept of God as a person — having explained HE was a force, to which I asked why he had just given a gender identity to a force, a puzzling use of the English language, acceptable in French, but inappropriate in our nominated communication medium when he rejoined, “And what about your sexuality?”

Now I must admit I was temporarily taken aback. I had just been in the throes of interjecting with a request for a weather report in his geographic area, and he had taken the initiative, or so I thought, to switch the subject from religion to sex, a rather surprising change, but a subject which I am partial to discussing. I was not quite sure whether he meant me to recount the last time I went to bed with someone; if I was feeling insecure as a woman; inadequate or whatever, and so answered his question with one of my own for further elaboration, to which he rejoined:

“Well, how do you feel as a woman, with God being represented as a man?”

Now I had really not thought of Our Father as being “Our Father — a woman!” I gave his question a few seconds deliberation and answered that I really felt delightfully comfortable with God being a man, actually I really could not imagine Him being any sex than male, but added: “a very important type of male — an androgynous one”. He did not understand the meaning and so I said: “God is unisex!”

He is, all in perfection. He is, and knows men and women, for did He not create “in His image”?

He laughed, made some comment as to how I never seemed to be stuck for a reply to anything. He did not seem to want to know anything about my opinions on sex, we chatted about mundane things and said goodbye.

But my curiosity had been aroused, and so I decided to find out what was the issue involved which was putting pressure on Our Father to have a sex change, in the minds of Urantians. Now it appears from my brief research — it had to be brief, for I really found in talking to ladies who feel that this sexist nonsense has got to stop and God should be a She instead of a He — I need to switch the subject to the weather faster and faster with each encounter.

It appears that, in a number of institutionalized religions, they are trying to reduce the continual redirection of spiritual requests coming out of Urantia, and are weaning most of their followers off numerous saints, and in particular, the virgin Mary, and get the congregation to direct all prayers to Jesus in the first instance. This does cause a lot of upset with the feminists who tell me that they feel that a man is not understanding enough of their emotions. My eyes widen in amazement. They don't think that Jesus is understanding of their emotional problems! They re-clarify that, no, they are not really saying this, but somehow they feel more of a bond in praying to a woman. You can guess what my next comment is!

One visit I had was with a lady minister and she explained that women do need to feel the closeness with a spiritual mother. I suggested that perhaps they will find, within the three members of the Trinity, a suitable Mother image, and she told me an amusing story which I would like to share with you.

The Trinity concept is a difficult one to grasp, and in theological college they were taught by a number of audio-visual techniques, one of which was a video of the activities in Heaven on a normal working day, centred within God's home. Perhaps to cut down on production costs, the whole video was ‘shot’ in one locale, God's office. To help the budding theological students, God was represented, seated behind a beautiful desk, discussing matters of universal import with God the Son, who was seated on the other side, while the Conjoint Actor was portrayed as Mum, whose tasks included popping in to replenish their coffee cups, change the vase of flowers on the desk, and run the duster quickly over the bookcase! I am sure this lovely lady has told this story numerous times, but still gets enjoyment to the point that we both laughed till tears were rolling down our faces. She advised that they never saw the end of the video, as the class was so much in hysterics, that their lecturer felt that they were just not grasping the subtle concepts of the Trinity.

But why do ladies want God to be a “She”? Surely the complement to ourselves, is our opposite. A little girl's first love is her Dad. The Blue Book tells us that there is no partnership as effective as members of the opposite sex.

> “A man and a woman, co-operating, even aside from family and offspring, are vastly superior in most ways to either two men or two women.” ([UB 84:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p1_9))

Why do ladies want Jesus and God to be female? I'm darned if I know.

And yet, as I think on this subject, I pose the question, would perhaps men, in this day and age, be benefited by looking at Jesus and God, not as masculine in the current human sense of the word, but more as androgynous? With the shameful way that little boys are educated to be actionists, to stifle and suppress their emotions, I wonder if therefore a goodly number have difficulty in understanding their Thought Adjuster, and the Spirit of Truth's loving guidance on how to “love as our Father loves”!

Maybe, if men could look at God more as a “She”, by Urantian definitions, they would be so much more spiritually responsive to mercy ministering, and be less factual and judgmental. (I love each and everyone of you, but boy, you can frustrate me at times!) I do not really know, as I am a woman and am really pleased that God and Jesus are male. But of this I am confident; the Eternal Son is described as our Mother; Michael of Nebadon is described as having a tinge more personality of the Eternal Son than of Our Father, and so perhaps they can be regarded as “She”, without too much mental discomfort. The reality, as I see it, is that once a man responds to the guidance of the spiritual influences within him, then as a by-product, any ideational confusion he may have on a material level of mind, due to the gender role requirements currently at play on Urantia, will be replaced by his Thought Adjuster and his personality's mastery of his mind; but, in the interim, it may be of value to dwell more on God's love, and Jesus' love and mercy.

## Walk In Harmony

I lead My Loved Ones by many paths. Do not subscribe to a confusion; neither confuse the mind of another by trying to see all things alike. Much strength and time are lost thereby. You, and other of My children, have found a pathway to my presence. What matter if it is a different path or if opinions vary as to the exact way to reach the goal? The thing of importance is that you each, in your own way, keep constant contact with Me. Why murmur among yourselves about the outer symbols along the roadside? Yea, you are like the disciples of old who while walking by the side of the Lord often stopped to argue as to the meaning of it all Be done with such foolishness! I have much work for My children to do together. Shall it be disturbed because as foolish children, you do not al ways think alike? 

If your hearts are filled with a pure, high love for Me, that is all I require. Cannot you trust Me to lead you to the high point of attainment and service? All these minor things of the outer semblance of worship natter so little. I dwell in the heart of each, and have no fear that I shall not be able to care for Mine Own! And so, go on, helping each other, loving each other; and know that a day shall dawn when I come to you and ask, “Who say ye that AM” And you shall all go on in My Service, of one mind and one accord.

**From the writings of Eva Bell Werber**

## An Open Letter To The Community Of Urantia Book Readers

August 1990

Brothers and Sisters in Christ:

My name is Paul Michael Waterman and I am writing this open letter to you all to recount a series of extraordinary events which I shared with a circle of associates in the period between 1981 and 1983.

Since 1983, I have stewarded certain aspects of the story that I shall unfold upon these pages. More recent events in your respective organizations, as well as the counsel of friends close to me, have led me to the decision to dispatch this document for your collective consideration.

As prologue, I should tell you that I have been a student of _The URANTIA Book_ since 1975. Since that time, I have had the privilege of meeting many fellow readers from Canada and the United States, and have come to the conclusion that the book is a powerful instrument for a personal spiritual transformation that must precede the planetary spiritual advance so needed in our time. For me, the book became a catalytic agent, culminating a five year study of cultural history by introducing the master universe context that gave meaning in high
relief to humanity's long struggle for maturity. More importantly, it also made real the personal relationship with the Creator that is the birthright of any son or daughter of God.

Having been given a perception of the great plan, one cannot go back or un-know. Nor would one wish to, however difficult things may become for the owner living on this confused world. How we can ever be certain of what we know has long been a puzzle and I must conclude that the gifts of grace are claimed by faith, and trust in the goodness of the spirit within us. In the hope that the foregoing has established my bona fides in the mind of the reader, let me proceed.

In 1981, my wife and I discovered that we had conceived a child. Initially, we had more concern than joy at this news, for the world seemed a more dangerous place a decade ago. Unclear as to our course, we gave our deep concerns over to prayer and sought guidance. In rather short order, and to our surprise, we received guidance in our meditations from sweet, inner voices that identified themselves as angels. They offered a vision of promise; words of such beauty and goodness that we chose to accept this contact as true and as an answer to our prayers. This gift from the angels helped us to clarify our minds and make the right decision. Seven months later, a beautiful son was born to us and he has remained one of the joys of existence for us since that time.

The contact with the angels was so beautiful, so gracious, that we were intent upon pursuing it, if only to remain in communication with such delightful society. What ensued was a growing document that portrayed for us how the celestials so near us take intimate concern for our lives and are dedicated beyond human understanding to helping us through the maze of mortal experiences.

In the spring of 1982, events took another surprising turn. What had developed as personal guidance and healing advice for troubled friends changed suddenly as the angels, who had come to be like old friends, asked us to consider taking a message from the Melchizedek Brotherhood to an individual who was then a memberat-large in the URANTIA Brotherhood. Up until that time, our experience had been personal, cultivated privately and shared cautiously with only a few close friends. For reasons outlined within the pages of the book itself, and which you all can appreciate, one would approach communication with the orders of being who sponsored _The URANTIA Book_ with some reserve. Nevertheless, the contact persisted and on March 24, 1982, an important message was received in the presence of a long-standing member of the Brotherhood. It is my understanding that copies of this message were later circulated, against my advice at the time. It is not my intention to reproduce the whole text within the body of this letter but to relate to you in context the essentials which remain germane to date.

The Melchizedek identified himself as one of the revelatory commission who remains charged with the responsibility of administering the revelation to this world. We were told that the subject of his dissertation was the URANTIA Foundation and the changes needed within it that it might function more fully in the service of the planet and the service of Christ Michael. He noted 1985 as a significant anniversary in the revelation's history and intimated that changes would begin to accelerate at that time. The changes required within the Foundation centred around its mindset. Individuals drawn to the revelation initially were selected from a mind and personality pattern that would act as good and faithful conservators of the text. Half a century later, this same mindset has become not an advantage, but rather an obstacle to the further dissemination of the revelation to the planet, not because changes are called for to the text, but rather that the same attitude that would preserve the document also has restrained freedom of expression of the Spirit in response to the revelation. The hand of God, having written, moves on to the greater, as should we all.

“It is not our desire to see a schism take place within the burgeoning URANTIA movement, as you would understand it. There is nothing in that which would further the development of the planet. And yet, I speak to you because there is a great potential that such a schism might take place.”

The indicator went on to assure us that there was a power within us to intervene and bring about further understanding of the task appointed to each and everyone who would come to know the Fifth Epochal Revelation. First and foremost, for anyone who would become a teacher of _The URANTIA Book_, is to learn Christ's lesson of love. He stated that had this lesson of love been more fully lodged in the hearts of the trustees, there would not have been such activities as would result in the squandering of the bestowal. Strong words indeed, followed by stronger still.

The Melchizedek spoke of Christy, noting that the time was at hand when the last member of the contact commission would be taken over to the higher level. He spoke of documents taken into secrecy which needed to be examined by the community. He advised individuals to move forward lovingly and fearlessly in open discussion and publication to express what they knew and felt, not to be concerned “with what would amount to the meaningless human noises such as would be raised by the more conservative members within the Foundation.”

He did not counsel rebellion but rather that those who felt inspired to do so act lovingly, spiritually portraying the rightness of their actions.

“It would not further to confront or attack ... but rather to lovingly portray your desire to serve.”

Having outlined the essence of the message, the Melchizedek then directed his words specifically to the individual to whom the task of carrying the message was offered. He outlined his reason for the choice and a surprising antidote to attitudinal deadlock. For the purpose of this letter, I will use the name that the Melchizedek used to address this draftee, Alexander, although he is known in the community by another name.

Alexander was selected because he had established contact with the principle individuals of concern. Then he was advised that he, like they, needed to learn moderation and love. That he should understand that the same ' $\sin$ ' as he would ascribe to members of the Foundation is the self-same 'sin' that he would commit; that being the sin of intolerance and arrogance. “Now it has been given to all of you to understand by the words of the master that we serve that there is no sin, that it is mere error. That guilt be alleviated and all would be liberated from such spiritual bondage is the desire of Christ Michael.”

The final significant piece of the picture came into focus when the Melchizedek advised that before the contact could be considered consummated and the true nature of their plans for the correction of intransigent problems in the Foundation could be conveyed, we would be required to demonstrate our good faith by a sincere reading of the Master's Course. This was a reference to “A Course in Miracles”, received by Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford and published by the Foundation for Inner Peace.

“It is not our desire to see a schism take place within the burgeoning URANTIA movement, as you would understand it. There is nothing in that which would further the development of the planet. And yet, I speak to you because there is a great potential that such a schism might take place.”

In the message, the Melchizedek also offered a grave warning, sufficient to give all of us pause to reflect on present circumstances. This I shall relate at the close of this letter.

After the reception of the Melchizedek contact in 1982, events began to swirl and accelerate. In retrospect, I think it fair to say that passions overran reason, egos trampled personalities and the human elements did not heed sufficiently those wise words of the celestial contacts seeking to gently guide us all to a state of inner peace where we could truly serve their plans.

In 1983, Alexander acted to decry the contact in a letter of personal attack directed toward myself. I sought to understand his actions because in the contact there was surely chaff in the wheat. Yet we were shocked, even devastated, and the Melchizedek contact was brought to a halt, although the celestial ministry continued. The commission was never fully outlined, defeated by human hubris. It is very disappointing to say that since that time within the URANTIA network, more of the same has been witnessed.

Following closely to the Melchizedek retirement came the Grimsley affair, the Boulder troubles, the Santa Barbara travesty and finally the forecasted schism in 1989. Surely other examples of the problem occurred that did not cross my desk. Although I retired from the URANTIA community in 1984, information continues to find me and I have continued to monitor the ongoing situation.

Thus in the fall of 1989 , I was again contacted by several of the human participants of 1982-83. Significantly, Alexander himself sought my advice on how to re-establish the Melchizedek connection since the forecasted schism had become a reality. Brothers and sisters in Christ, why do we insist on sacrificing the messengers if the message is disturbing? Regrettably, at that time, all I could reply to the inquirers was that the Melchizedeks had not offered any contact since 1984 , although I felt that any such communication might simply point to an open barn door and empty stalls.

Since these in quiries, I have wrestled with many emotions in an attempt to achieve such clarity of mind necessary to choose the wise course to chart. At last, while many of you were gathered in Colorado, walking with God, I arrived at the decision to release this letter and let the chips fall. I realize that by so doing, I could be opening myself up to further personal attack, given the demonstrated predilections of some. I think it is necessary for all of us to rise above our egos to hear the Spirit of Truth. I hope that it is possible to resolve the dilemmas facing the URANTIAN community in ways that would speak to history of our maturation in Spirit. At present, I regret that I cannot align with any of your organizations although I hope that in the heart of each of us, we work to the same great plan.

As for the celestial contact, it has continued to develop quietly. Information received has put the case of Gabriel vs. Lucifer into a new context. An invitation has been offered for us to prepare our minds for communication with the Daynals as they work on the planet in anticipation of the next dispensation.

Insights have been offered that point to a miraculous movement of the Supreme on our world, perhaps the last shall indeed be the first.

This material, while most comprehensible to the URANTIAN network with the context for it, is, like _The URANTIA Book_ itself, meant for all peoples. We all have a great work to follow through with and in our hearts we know of these things. For these reasons, and for the love of Christ, can we find peace? Let the Universe Conciliators function and let resolution of your misunderstandings begin with true forgiveness and honest humility in the heart of each of us, from all of us.

Earlier in this letter I mentioned a warning from the Melchizedek. While I have taken little pleasure in the realization of the schism they forecasted in 1982 , I should find great remorse in seeing this warning come to pass, it being too high a price to pay for the verification of the contact.

“The warning being, that should such attitudes (sic arrogance, intolerance, obstinacy) not be changed within the very structure and centre of the Foundation, then that Foundation will fall, for we will not support such rigidity. It is based in fear. There is nothing that can be taken away from the truth, in and of itself it is whole. The truth speaks through the Spirit and to souls of mortals who are on this planet and are ready for the reception of it. There is no need for such rigid safeguarding of the revelation. It is an absurdity to see such rigidity and such fear as the motivations of the responses to requests well taken from members within the organization for a greater release of the information.”

We all have a great work to follow through with and in our hearts we know of these things. For these reasons, and for the love of Christ, can we find peace?

And that is the whole point here. That the squabbling, the personal attacks and the posturing so much in evidence over these last years and so well documented and circulated have certainly impaired and may even extinguish the URANTIA movement as we know it.

The Melchizedeks have indicated that without sincere and meaningful change within the structure and administration of the Foundation, they will consider declaring a default, not unknown on this world, and withdraw their support for the enterprise. What I ask each person who reads this story to consider is this: Is this what you truly desire? What have you done to contribute or to forestall such an action? Please remember that the revelation is written on paper, not stone and thus can become as fragile as it is precious.

Consider also that should the Melchizedeks withdraw their support and that of the planetary government as well, then surely nothing will stop the fall of the URANTIA Foundation. Even in the anger and frustration felt by some, none could truly wish for such an event. I certainly do not.

In closing, I include a prayer offered by the Melchizedek on March 24, 1982. In it he recognizes our weaknesses as humans but also acknowledges our potential for greatness. I share it in hope that it may help us to know more fully the greatness inherent in each of our sisters and brothers in Christ.

O Father of Light,

O Spinner of Divine Universes,

O Creator of All that Is.

I give thanks that beings such as these have evolved on worlds such as this, that we may join in consciousness and be as one, that we may work through Your Plan and through Your Peace. O Divine Father, in our union, are we greatly blessed. And let all be offered up to You in praise and in thanksgiving, for the greater revelations that attend their hour and for the Love and Peace that stands among us. Now Father, I ask that you bless all who have entered into our operation with understanding, with patience and with a tolerance of each other's human foibles. That they may come to see reflected in the growth of the brethren their own spiritual unfolding portrayed. Amen.

... And so say I, remaining Yours in the service of the Prince of Peace,
