## “Thought For The Month” 

“And so I give you this new commandment.: That you love one another as I have loved you. And by this will all men know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another.” ([UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1))

## Editorial

_We are pleased to be able to publish many of the responses from both Australian and overseas readers to our new format. As expected, some agree with our solution and some don't._

_Overall, however, we have heard from only a small percentage of subscribers. We would love to hear more! We feel that as long as we all view developments of Six-O-Six as evolution, not revolution, then we will continue to broadly satisfy the needs of a diverse readership._

_One misconception that is important to clarify is that contributors to Part 2 are by and large URANTIA Book readers, relating their personal experiences and this will continue to be our policy._

_The great strength of Six-O-Six is, and will hopefully remain, that of being an open conduit of ideas and points of view from all concerned, with a minimum of editorial interference. “Strength in unity and unity in diversity”. So as Dean Martin used to say at the end of his TV show: “Keep them cards ‘n’ letters rollin' in!”_

**Madeline Noordzy**

## 1991 Conference

**When**: Labour Day holiday weekend. From Friday 4th to Monday 7th October, with Tuesday 8th an optional extra day.

**Where**: Canberra YHA (Youth Hostel Association), Dryandra Street, O'Connor.

The conference weekend coincides with the Canberra Springtime Floriade (national flower display) and a trip to the gardens will be incorporated into the program. The YHA backs onto the Black Mountain Nature Reserve which has extensive walking trails. Spring in Canberra can be cold — so rug up.

The conference will officially close on the Monday but Tuesday will be available for those who wish to stay on an extra day.

Accommodation for Monday night will be made available at the homes of readers in Canberra.

Registration forms and further information on accommodation and cost will be included on separate forms with this newsletter.

For more information phone:

## Do You Need A Pilot's Licence On Jerusem?

I suspect it will not be necessary if we choose to fly by bird, but the mechanical devices are going to need operational instructions. Actually, as I read _The URANTIA Book_, I get the impression that they are little morontia helicopters, and suspect that there are limited seats on them. Goodness, I hope that they, at least, have room for a navigator, as I get a mental image of me trying to steer the contraption through space with a map upside down on my lap (maybe I will not be left-handed on the mansion worlds) trying to figure out where I am going.

Seeing one can break limbs whilst in morontia form, I can visualize myself and the poor trusting unfortunate who decided to accompany me on my joy flight, bruised and plastered, hobbling out of the Jerusem hospital a few weeks later. Perhaps my apprehensions are unfounded, as I did not note any reference to aircraft disaster statistics in the Blue Book, and we all know that you cannot get killed up there.

Life was definitely less complicated for me before _The URANTIA Book_, when all there was was one place called heaven! We did not do much except play harps; there was eternal indolence! I could cope with having wings, and flitting through heaven, as I imagined that I could never get lost; heaven was like a spiritual Earth, and although it had suburbs and states and countries, if I got lost, some obliging spirit would fly home with me. But this was all so much theorizing, since I really knew I had nothing to worry about, as I would have transcended time and space and could be anywhere my heart desired on forever hereafter, and have found it somewhat disconcerting to be told this is not the case.

I am going to have to learn navigation and languages, and although I am alright when travelling between planets, as then I am enseraphimed, and have the most sublime confidence in the transport Seraphim. They have been travelling the Universe for years, and even if they did get lost, a Solitary Messenger or some such person would locate them, and I would have slept through the whole thing. It is the intra-planetary transport that is worrisome. Maybe they will have the equivalent of Urantia public transport!

Air space does seem to be reasonably well controlled with a designated take off and landing place and times of departure, but I would love to see the radar tracking stations. Must be fascinating to see all the folks to-ing and fro-ing throughout the universe.

I wonder if the morontia machines are like Urantia helicopters. I just love helicopters, and I could fly close to the ground so I did not get too lost, and there are no mountains to crash into if I happen to not be looking ahead of me.

I suppose they provide us with crash helmets, but then I am not quite sure because I do not know whether we wear any clothes up there.

When I go to school up there, I hope that my celestial advisers do not feel that I should undertake a scientific stream of studies, as I really feel my calling is more in the direction of the reversion corps. I suppose I would not mind being a laboratory assistant in the Life Carriers laboratories, as I would be interested in seeing how they decide that a tomato should be red in colour rather than blue. Fine technical details such as that appeal to me, and to think they pack all of this information into protozoa!

Beyond a cursory glance of post-Urantia mansion world living, to date I have not started serious deliberations on Uversa daily lifestyle, but maybe, after being a reader for another ten years or so, I will give up trying to envisage the mansion worlds and see if the worlds beyond are any more clearly described!

## From Our Mailbox

### Growth And Change

The editorial comments by Neil Francey and Madeline Noordzy open up some important issues that we must face. Over the past two years we Australians sat on the fence and tried to understand the processes occuring to URANTIA Book readers in America. The polarization between the fundamental approach of control, slow and steady, consolidate good basic understanding versus that of the broader, open, cross-pollination, reach-out-to-a-wider-audience approach.

Kathleen Swadling's excellent article would embrace the thoughts of many Australian readers. (Read that article again to understand the basic principles involved with the conservative, fundamentalist approach.) However, Madeline, as the focus for the Six-O-Six, is able to gauge from readers' feedback what people want to read. She has taken a courageous stand with some of her editorial comments and to her credit included some stimulating articles, improved production, presentation (some credit also goes to Tony Rudd) and set Six-O-Six on a footing as a respectable international outreach.

Are we at the crossroads for change and natural growth? Here I'd like to quote from the announcement of the newly formed AASUB or Australian Association of Students of _The URANTIA Book_:

“Another objective is to encourage the social interaction of readers by supporting an annual conference, a national newsletter and to facilitate between readers.” (Six-O-Six Vol 12 No 2 March/April 1991)

Is it time for more than one newsletter? Is it time for more than one association? Is it time for three associations and three newsletters? For Keith Bacon has been reaching out also. Is there room for:

1. Six-O-Six international focus and newsletter, Melbourne.
2. AASUB National focus and newsletter, Sydney.
3. FUSOM Victorian focus and newsletter, Melbourne.

What are your thoughts on the current developments which until recently have been of the one accord?

Can I make a request that this topic be placed on the agenda for the National Conference in Canberra later this year?

### Doing A Service

Well, who would've thought my article in _Cosmic Reflections_ would have started such a ruckus? Fact is, I think that you are doing folks in the URANTIA movement a service by airing the ideas of people like Joe Pope, Sananda, etc., so folks are aware of these unusual people and their teachings. Then each person can decide how they wish to react.

It seems that apocalypticism has been with us for a long time. If you remember, the early Christians, because of a mis-interpretation of Jesus' words, stopped working and banded together in communes in Jerusalem in anticipation of the end times. Paul, fearful that they would starve to death, requested that donations be sent to them, and told them to get back to work. The Jehovah's Witnesses have several times predicted the end, retreated to caves, then had to come up with a cover story when the end didn't arrive. Recently, a “prophetess” predicted the end and had her followers build concrete bunkers in the hills of a western U.S. state. A lot of folks fell away when the end date came and went without incident. The list goes on and on. Makes me wonder why seemingly rational, intelligent people would quit their jobs, sell everything and go and live in a cave to become the laughing stock of the media because of some Pied Piper of apocalypticism

And what of the self-proclaimed prophets and channellers in our movement, what is their motivation? Maybe one or two are genuine. Perhaps some have had a profound spiritual experience on which they base their ideas. _The URANTIA Book_ says that many strange 'isms" have arisen because of overreaction to such an experience. Others may have a pathological need for attention. Their strange or catastrophic claims bring either attacks or praise; either is a form of attention. But the ones who bother me the most are those who seek power and money, either consciously or not.

The suicide of Jim Jones' followers in his colony in South America shows how far things can go. And enough people in the URANTIA movement took a ‘prophet’ in California seriously enough to cause divisions and distress within the movement.

There are a few other problems that false prophets and channellers can cause in our movement. One of these is dilution of purpose. There is much worthy work that needs to be done inside and outside the movement. I think it would be a shame to neglect the important work in order to prepare for an end that never comes. It seems to me that there is too much negative emotion involved in this end time business. We may fear that we will be taken unaware by a catastrophe or sudden world transformation. The fear may cause us to focus inwardly, on self preservation. Our only service role may be that of Chicken Little, spreading alarm wherever we go.

Another problem I can see is the movement's image. People's initial impressions of _The URANTIA Book_ and the movement will often be their impression of us or our publications. If our movement is perceived as apocalyptic, many may be turned off by that, and never give the book a chance. It's hard enough explaining the strange names of the authors of the papers; I don't think that we need additional handicaps! Perhaps the appropriate task for those who don't go along with the self-proclaimed prophets and channellers is to make sure that voices of moderation are given equal time.

But I would be less than honest if I didn't look at the other side of the coin. Some people have come to _The URANTIA Book_ by rather unconventional paths, such as _A Course In Miracles_, Transcendental Meditation, the teachings of Edgar Casey or Yogananda, the study and practice of Eastern religions, etc. Because people's psychology differs, different paths appeal to them. The teachings of some of the self-proclaimed prophets may open a door for a few people that leads to study of _The URANTIA Book_. If the self-proclaimed prophet or channeller is not an exploiter, if they don't use fear tactics, if they aren't trying to build a personality based cult, then they may sometimes perform a valuable service for the movement. I recall that Jesus said,

> “_In the generations to come many who are not wholly worthy will do many strange things in my name, but I will not forbid them._” ([UB 159:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_1))

Some people in the movement may do strange things that make us feel uncomfortable, but providing they are bearing spiritual fruits, we should welcome them as spiritual brothers and sisters. We don't have to agree with them, but we can agree to disagree agreeably. After all, we wouldn't want to be caught with rocks in our hands when a real prophet finally appears!

### Concerned

We have watched in amazement as the Six-O-Six has unfolded in the past few months. We are students of _The URANTIA Book_ and as such are concerned at the number of “isms” etc. which are creeping into the publication.

We seem to have received a choice of alternate Six6-O-Six's — i.e. to subscribe to Part I or Part II. We believe there is also another option — to receive neither. We choose the latter, as we believe that we are free to pursue any interest we wish and indeed will do so, but believe also the Six-O-Six should be concerned only with _The URANTIA Book_ and not news of people's personal communication with angels and the like.

**Alex and Jane King, Sydney**

### Listening

I have recently been exposed to Six-O-Six through my friends Sananda and White Cloud. I want to express my appreciation for your efforts to promote international goodwill and understanding between readers of _The URANTIA Book_.

I am also writing to extend my support to you for printing the articles regarding our new Planetary Prince, the Caligastia visit and any others about the Planetary Center of Light.

I can imagine the potential ripples of reaction which might be triggered by these articles. I trust readers of _The URANTIA Book_ will call upon the many tools given for discerning truth, for recognizing and comprehending multi-dimensional concepts and for responding to major transitions with as much inner serenity and balanced inner essence as one is capable of mustering.

As we develop into a planetary community, I feel we must take the time to build into our regional meetings a grounded capacity for listening to and evaluating in a relaxed manner the many claims which are coming forth.

For what it's worth, I have known Sananda and White Cloud for 17 years. For as long as I have known them they have been teaching quality classes on _The URANTIA Book_ and have always acted towards me with the greatest integrity.

I have absolute faith in their exciting developments with our Planetary Prince and with Master Lao-Tse. I have seen Machiventa's and Lao-Tse's faces shining with beauty, compassion and wisdom in the space which normally holds Sananda's face, and encourage us all to consult first the Spirit of Truth within our own hearts before we consult our minds. These are truly challenging times, momentous times with miracles occurring in graceful procession. May the way be opened for a balanced response to all that which is true straight through to the core, and may we be at least a portion as merciful towards one another as our loving Creator is towards us.

### Agree To Disagree

To get away from all the personal tit-for-tat that has been going on lately I would like to start by being a bit more philosophical about the role Six-O-Six has played in the past for readers of _The URANTIA Book_. It started up as a valuable tool to keep students of _The URANTIA Book_ in touch with one another. People who find _The URANTIA Book_ have a tendency to crave for the company of other readers as there are so many changes they go through and so much for them to understand as they study the book. As many readers are spread out over this vast country, the newsletter has played a vital role in keeping readers in touch with one another, sharing ideas and points of view and announcements of study group and conference activities etc. It was a newsletter which was set up for readers of _The URANTIA Book_. Now many of those readers have come from incredibly diverse backgrounds. Many have been searching for years for something which satisfies their spiritual yearnings. Many have found that satisfaction through _The URANTIA Book_ — others are still seeking and _The URANTIA Book_ is one of many wonderful works they have stumbled upon. Whatever the current status of each reader, Six-OSix has been a newsletter which services _The URANTIA Book_ component of people's spiritual quest. The form it was in satisfied all. Anyone wishing to investigate _The URANTIA Book_ found Six-O-Six an assistant to their investigation. However by changing the direction of the newsletter you are catering for anyone and everyone on a spiritual quest of some kind. I have no problem with a newsletter which services this need but I do not feel it is relevant that Six-O-Six becomes a newsletter to service this need without first consulting the entire readership which is made up of people who have been contributing and supporting financially and morally since it first began. The personal attacks which have resulted from this scenario is indicative that a change was imposed rather than discussed.

Nobody (apart from those closest to me) really know what other interest I have in religious or spiritual matters outside of my involvement with _The URANTIA Book_. It is not something that I advertise — it is personal and it is my business. Let us suppose I have a desire to investigate The Bible, The Koran, and the Bahai Faith. I would seek out books, newsletters and groups which would enlighten me in these areas. I would attend the study groups and read their newsletters but I would not try to push _The URANTIA Book_ onto them. I would be extremely openminded and try to glean the truth from their teachings. I would certainly not write articles in their newsletters telling them how they should believe, that there's a new revelation of truth and they must be open-minded to new truths, that they've got it wrong etc. Jesus would never tell the religionists of his day that they've got it wrong — rather he would seek to highlight and add to those truths which existed in their religion.

The splitting of the newsletter into two parts is a compromise and a step in the right direction but I feel that Part II should be given a different name as it is really a separate newsletter dealing with a broader range of material appealing to a different group of people who are on a broader spiritual quest as opposed to those wishing to get their minds around _The URANTIA Book_. The fact that some readers are not interested in E-3, Melchizedek channellings and messages from Gabriel etc. does not mean that they are close-minded to everything outside of _The URANTIA Book_ and I find it highly offensive to have someone presume this and publicly state it.

I would therefore like to propose either of the following:

1. That Part II becomes a separate newsletter running under a new name under the present editorship and Part I remains Six-O-Six and is handed back to the original editor who is presently co-editor, Neil Francey; or,
2. As Neil suggested, an autonomous publications and editorial board be set up to determine an editorial policy and the present editors work with this board. Whether it be affiliated with the new Association or not would be a matter for discussion and debate at a later stage.

Whatever happens I do not think we should be too worried about differing points of view. We are, after all, a group made up of diverse individuals. The only divisions which could be of a harmful nature is if we were divided in our hearts. Remember when Jesus said to his apostles “When did I tell you that you should all think alike?” Differing points of view often result in a separation of some kind — it's only natural at our low stage of evolution when we are so far from mastering the art of working harmoniously together.

> Remember when Jesus said to his apostles “When did I tell you that you should all think alike?”

Let's not kid ourselves that we're spiritually advanced yet. It doesn't mean we stop loving one another. Some of my most cherished friends and I are often at loggerheads with one another over differing points of view. I may be at loggerheads with Madeline over the newsletter issue but it does not mean that I love her any less than before. So why don't we agree to disagree and get on with serving in the areas we feel drawn toward and let's stop accusing each other publicly of being spiritually retarded.

**Kathleen Swadling, Sydney**

### All Of It

I have been enjoying Six-O-Six for quite a few years. The articles are so bright, intelligent, and stimulating that I often thought of writing to compliment Australians for publishing one of the more interesting and worthwhile journals in our movement. I was elated to read of the formation of AASUB and pray for your Australian Association of Readers and associated fellowship of students to grow “... in the Joy of the realization of sonship”.

It was when I received your Vol 12 No. 1 that I noticed a marked change in the policy of your publication that appears to have resulted from the tumultuous confusion over your having previously published the debate by readers over the efficacy of some tapes having to do with a worldwide disaster. Vol 12 No 1 was like the tabloids that we see at the check-out lines in supermarkets — **“Big Foot Captures 12 Year Old Girl in Montana”** or **“Graveyard Found On The Moon”**. I was inclined to send you a request to remove my name from your mailing list just to let you know how disappointed I was with the new direction that you were taking. It seemed as though any outlandish, ego-tripping, misguided material would now be able to find its way into print on your pages under the guise of ‘open-mindedness’. I'm glad, however, that I denied myself the impulsive reaction for I would not have received your next issue with the news of the formation of AASUB, the interesting article by Kathleen Swadling, and the heart-rending letter from Paul Michael Waterman of Toronto, not to mention the bright spot: “Is God a He or a She” which again reminded me of the gift of the Australian spirit that I enjoyed so much about Six-O-Six. I would also like to thank the editors for their frank and open discussion of editorial policy that enabled me to understand you both a little better and the fact that you are working on working together rather than destroy the whole endeavour over a fight.

URANTIA Book readers come from all walks of life, all races and cultures of the planet. Attending a conference of URANTIA Book readers in one way is like going to the public beach where you run into people with whom you would never otherwise have associated. Because of the diversity of cultural orientation among readers in our movement, it is incumbent upon publishers of newsletters in our movement to stick to _The URANTIA Book_, its study, and the experience of readership. New Age religious cults, channelled material and the like have their own publications (or should). I, for one, feel imposed upon to have read all of this other material in the context of the URANTIA movement.

Again let me thank you for your important publication. I pray for your continued production and a good solution to this adventure. I do not want to receive half of the next Six-O-Six, but all of it. Having it in two parts is like what is going on between the URANTIA Foundation and the Fifth Epochal Fellowship. What is going to happen in that situation is that one of them will die or they will go off in two opposing factions splitting the movement up.

**Martin Greenhut, Monterey, Montana, USA**

### Good Solution

I think you have come up with a good solution to your problem of the focus of Six-O-Six. This way URANTIA Book readers who have an interest in the other material are not denied easy access to it; and those who are not interested don't have to sort it out from the URANTIA book related material. Newsletters are similar to study groups in this respect — if you are too expansive in the subject matter, the publication transforms itself into something other than a URANTIA Book newsletter.

Please send me only the first section. I have investigated any number of other channels — including _the URANTIA Book_ readers in New Zealand — and never found anything which rings true as do _The URANTIA Book_ and my own inner guide. As a result, while I'm somewhat open-minded still, my interest in these other sources is lukewarm at best; and I'd prefer you not to spend the money to send me the second part.

**Kaye Cooper, Houston, Texas, USA**

### Polishing Quality

I am just writing to congratulate Madeline and Tony on the last edition of Six-O-Six for its professionalism and courage.

I have enjoyed the extra URANTIA Book material that has crept into Six-O-Six over the last twelve months. Some of it has been inspiring and some of it not so, but it's always been challenging to what I believe and this I welcome for its polishing quality.

I am a little disappointed by the need to keep this current news separate, but if people do not want to know or would prefer exclusive URANTIA Book issues in their Six-O-Six, then that's okay. and I hope the method of avoiding conflict is openly received by everyone. _The URANTIA Book_ instructs us to be aware of other people's spiritual experiences.

We students of _The URANTIA Book_ are connected by a global-cosmic-consciousness that should be strong and loyal enough to overcome any differences, a consciousness that will manifest tolerance that even the angels would admire.

Anyway, keep up the good work and I look forward to the next edition.

### No Spoon-Fed Or Censored News

Six-O-Six is a quality newspaper! (I like the idea of the Part I and Part II so that Part II can be skipped by those who are sensitive to the information.)

Because I continue to keep my physical senses open to all information — which is then filtered through my communication with my Thought Adjuster, I feel you are doing a good job in reporting the “news” which comes through your office.

Editing is sometimes a very unpleasant task because readers have the ability to “second-guess” and criticize everything. Since the purpose of newsletters is to share information and personal perceptions and/or opinions, it is right and intellectually healthy to differ in our acceptance of all articles in the news source.

Just because we have _The URANTIA Book_ doesn't mean that we are all stamped out alike in feelings, intelligence, and abilities to perceive truth. However, because we all have _The URANTIA Book_ and know about our Thought Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth, none of us should be afraid to read and discern truth of any news reporting for ourselves. I for one, would be sorely insulted if I had to have my news “spoon-fed” and censored by any other than my own intelligence guided by my unseen helpers!

It is my life experience “motto” to always **follow Truth from wherever it comes and to wherever it takes us!** We cannot continue in a mistake unless we close our senses and our spiritual ears to the shenanigans of the ego, which usually takes its cues from out-of-balance emotions — fear.

I have 4 study groups in my home. _The URANTIA Book_ readers who attend are from different religious backgrounds ... and are currently practicing many forms of religion. Consequently, we have some very interesting and informing conversations — which quickly become arguments when any ONE person misunderstands the purpose of the discussion. If we can retain our sense of balance and realize that those not **taught**, or practicing a certain form of religion may not **understand a certain point** of reference, we can inform and teach. Perhaps they have been taught by their religious teachers that the point raised by another — taught by religious teachers from another religion — was wrong. Many times it is as simple as semantics — use of the word in different ways. As soon as they **understand** the situation from the second person's perspective, peace once again ensures the rest of the discussion and everyone has learned.

_The URANTIA Book_ teaches us to learn about others' religion. By understanding, one can peacefully accept the other point of view. The word tolerance has been used to mean: **“I accept your way of thinking as wrong but I won't fight you”**. This is not understanding, nor peaceful co-existence.

This can be applied to the news in your Part II of Six-O-Six. Let's at least know about and discern the truth, not hide our heads and intellects in URANTIA Fundamentalism which might make us blind to a new revelation. At this time, I personally have little interest in what is going on in Sedona, Arizona — even feel there is a great deal of “tares planted with the wheat” (Jesus' parable of Truth and untruth growing together until known by its fruit) — however, I have no problem with keeping up with developments until I can make a decision based on intelligence and spiritual knowing.

A few years ago I was impressed by a combination of truth from _The URANTIA Book_ ([UB 117:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p1_1) and [UB 126:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p2_5)) and having shared it (in a personal way) one artist in my study groups drew it out and framed it which now hangs above us when we study and discuss many points of truth and opinion. May I share them with you?

### Appreciating The Delicacy

Thank you for your continuing efforts to link the Australian readers of _The URANTIA Book_ through the Six-O-Six. I appreciate receiving each copy.

I also appreciate the delicate way in which the recent editorial crisis has been handled, as explained in the March/April 1991 edition. Your solution appears to me to embody the teachings of Christ Michael and _The URANTIA Book_, and is an object lesson to our political leaders in how to resolve conflicts.

Would you please only send me the first section of the newsletter in future, as Part 2 contents strike no chord within me like my reading of _The URANTIA Book_ does.

**Mike Taylor, Shepparton, Victoria**

### Balanced Comments

Just a note to say “Thank you” for all your wonderful work on the newsletter. I really enjoy your comments and find them very balanced. Keep up the good work, we think you're wonderful.

**Heather Johnson, Buchan, Victoria**

### Support

Just a note to let you know I truly support your work with Six-O-Six. I'm looking forward to receiving the next newsletter via David Glass, especially Sananda's articles. Although I haven't had the pleasure of being in the presence of Lao-Tse or Machiventa, I am confident that these personalities are indeed using Sananda's light body, having experienced deep meditation with both White Cloud and Sananda over ten years ago. Since their move out of California we had lost contact with them while we were busy with the more traditional roles of bringing up baby and the more conservative aspects of the URANTIA movement, i.e. Brotherhood, Society, study groups, etc. About the time of the break-up of the UF/UB we reconnected and about a year later we received the announcement about Machiventa. I remember thinking at the time that it seemed to be something that Sananda and White Cloud had been working on for as long as we had known them and that it finally had come to pass. As far as writing to say that I have experienced either manifestation of Machiventa or Lao-Tse, I cannot. However I will write something about my experiences at a later time once I am able to formulate exactly what it is I do want to share about these experiences or the possibility of them or anything else that seems pertinent to supporting you and your work. I myself have never been one to shy away from controversy when I feel passionately about something and the URANTIA teachings are one of them! I am currently in the process of looking up references to material complements and other subjects in _The URANTIA Book_ to verify what I believe to be happening. I will keep you posted!

### Working Things Out

Some months ago I started receiving your newsletter. Thanks to David Glass, your Six-O-Six connection, I look forward to each new publication. It gives me the opportunity to have a feel for what you folks are thinking and doing down under as UB readers. I hope this experience will allow me to gain some insight to global awareness.

I too have noticed a change in your format, and yes you do seem to be dealing with more subject matter that is referred to around here as ‘New Age’ stuff. some people are simply not open to that way of thinking, some are.

I guess the bottom line is that as the editors, you can do as you please. I know it's not as simple as that, and sometimes it's difficult to agree that we will disagree. What pleases me most is that you two are trying to work things out. God's speed.

Keep up the good work. There are many of us in the U.S. that enjoy Six-O-Six.

## Love

In Answer to Six-O-Six March/April 1991 “Every Now \& Zen” — A New Age Yogi's Lament, by Kirsten McFadden.

Yes, Kirsten, I'm one of those who, in your New Age Lament -

- Sit with my legs entwined — chanting AUM, and go within and find love!
- Study Eastern Religions and their spiritual outlook: — and finds growth — \& love!
- Eyes on the tip of my nose, my mind stilled from the outside world and finds — love!
- I visualize the hearts of ALL — and find we are all one in Spirit = love!
- Yes, I finger my rosary or Japamala Beads — and find my heart filled with compassion for you, Kirsten, and all other souls who can't allow others to be ... as they are fulfilling their destiny like you, whether it's as:
- A Buddhist = love!
- A Zen Master = love!
- A Yogi = love!
- A New Age Aspirant = love!
- A URANTIA Book reader = love!

Through these spiritual outlets I have found myself looking more deeply past the personality and the not-sonice behaviour, to their truth, which is Spirit — Soul — which is part of me and you, Kirsten.

Think only Love. Live only Love. Practice only Love.

### Name And Number Of Our Planet

Thank you for separating _The URANTIA Book_ related material from the “broader issues”. In future, please send me only Part I, the part relating to _The URANTIA Book_. I have a further suggestion. In view of the fact that “Six-O-Six” was originally intended to serve students of _The URANTIA Book_, and until recently has done nothing other than this, do you not think it sensible to change the name of what is currently “Six-O-Six Part II” to something else, and keep the name “Six-O-Six” for what is currently Part I? The designated number of our planet, and its name as well, for that matter, has never been revealed by any source other than _The URANTIA Book_, as far as I know, and for many of us who study it, the Fifth Epochal Revelation carries a degree of authenticity for transcending any other work.

Surely the name, and the number of our planet, are more appropriately used in a newsletter designed to serve students of _The URANTIA Book_ than in a forum of “broader issues”.

**William Wentworth, Towamba, NSW**

### Two Parts Unacceptable

I would like to support Neil Francey's article on reviewing the direction for Six-O-Six. I feel that the separation of our newsletter into two parts is unacceptable to me as a reader as I feel this is not helping to unify _The URANTIA Book_ movement in Australia. If anything, I feel it will divide and confuse the readership.

I therefore think that it is important that Six-O-Six is kept as a unified newsletter under the original structure that Neil set it up to be. I suggest that Part II should be renamed to something other than Six-O-Six. I feel that under the present circumstances the only proper and fair way to rectify the situation is to restore the editorship to Neil Francey or, as Neil suggested in his article, to elect a publications committee which would be affiliated with the newly formed Association.

**Trevor Swadling, Sydney**

## International News

### Legal Wrangle

Some readers may have become aware of electronic copies of _The URANTIA Book_ being made on some software called Folio Views database which also includes an electronic concordance. It appears that these have been distributed by Kristen Maaherra from Tucson Arizona. The Urantia Foundation has taken legal action against her and J.J. Johnson who was accused of helping her in the distribution of the disks.

On March 15, 1991, the United States District Court of Arizona issued a Preliminary Injunction Order which not only places restrictions upon the two defendants, but also directs that “all other persons acting in concert or participation with defendant, are hereby...required to...turn over all [electronic] copies of _The Urantia Book_ in their possession.” These same people are required to “Turn over all records referring or relating to the dissemination of infringing databases or disks, including the identities of the persons to whom the infringing materials were disseminated; identify each person to whom they distributed infringing disks or whom they otherwise know or believe to possess such a copy” and “... recall each previously disseminated copy.”

Any reader who wishes to comply should send information or material to the Foundation. Any legal obligation to do so for readers outside the U.S. (or Arizona, for that matter) is problematic for two reasons, either the jurisdiction of the court, or whether readers regard themselves as people who “acted in concert or participation with the defendant” as opposed to being passive recipients. Perhaps it should be a matter of individual conscience rather than legal necessity.

Six-O-Six has received quite a large amount of correspondence about this issue. We hope that the Spirit of Truth operating through the various protagonists will shine forth and a resolution be found. If not, the matter will be dealt with on a more secular level with a final legal court case due to occur next December.

Six-O-Six has received the following correspondence concerning this issue and any reader who is interested in more details can write to us and ask for them.

**Tony Rudd**

_Six-O-Six has received a ten page letter written by Mo Siegel in Boulder, Colorado. We do not intend to reprint the letter here, but the following may provide a brief summary. Mo has concerns in four major areas about the Foundation. In the interests of a balanced perspective, Six-O-Six has written to the Foundation to ask for their response to Mo's allegations. We hope to be able to bring this to you in the next issue, but in the meantime here is what Mo is claiming. Interested readers can write to us for a copy of the complete letter if they wish._

### Some Concerns

**1. Shutting Down Sales To Bookstores**

Mo claims that in August 1990, Urantia Foundation stopped shipping to most U.S. book distributors, whose sales volume accounted for nearly 80% of all URANTIA Books sold.

Urantia Foundation claims they now service bookstores directly but Mo maintains that this is not working. In a survey he conducted in 485 bookstores in 15 major markets, _The URANTIA Book_ lost 51% bookstore availability between the months of October 1990 and January 1991.

**2. Financial and Administrative Considerations**

The amount of money the Foundation spends on legal expenses is Mo's second area of concern. In financial years 1988 and 1989, he says The Foundation spent almost $1 million in legal and accounting fees. In 1989 , legal/accounting amounted to 62% of expenditure, while money spent on library placement programmes, money for training leaders and teachers, dollars for study group development, funds for secondary works etc. accounted for 1.5%.

**3. Concerns About Protection Of Copyright**

Copyright lasts 75 years, hence _The URANTIA Book_ has 40 or so years left under copyright. Mo says that in the interests of ensuring the Book's protection after copyright expires, there needs to be between one and three million books sold to prevent “unprincipled or deluged religionists with millions of dollars [distributing] a re-authored and rewritten URANTIA Book.” He maintains that the current attempt by the Foundation to limit book sales runs counter to this intention.

**4. Questions on Authorship**

Mo quotes three instances over the last three years where the Foundation has allegedly assigned human authorship of parts of the URANTIA Book. “While I don't accuse anyone of intentional wrong doing, honest appraisal to safeguard the revelation requires understanding why lawyers might desire to deny divine authorship” Mo says.

**Tony Rudd**

### “Epochal Revolt”

Right from the beginning we have enjoyed the Six-OSix, and in time we have seen it expand, becoming more interesting, varied and professional. Lately articles with additional information have been published in Six-O-Six, articles not “strictly” deriving from _The URANTIA Book_. This has caused an uproar amongst some people.

As Neil Francey (co-editor of Six-O-Six) states:

“It appears that Six-O-Six has in recent issues weighted its articles and editorial comments to a particular interest group and away from a strict URANTIA Book discipline. Readers are now having to address a new direction. Is this publication continuing to assist readers evaluate new ideas providing greater insights and understanding? Is it meeting changing needs? As a result, is Six-O-Six enjoying and increasing appreciation by readers or is it becoming too general?”

Initial unrest about the contents of the Six-O-Six started with the announcement of the E-3 tapes. The message mainly dealt with the lives that we will live when we have passed the latter days of this millennium and moved into the next one with an expanded consciousness, in closer cooperation with our celestial friends. This is in line with _The URANTIA Book_.

> “Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs (‘epoch’ = ‘New Age’) of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment” ([UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

This will not just happen as part of the slow evolution as we have known it so far. At this crucial point in the evolution of our planet and of all mankind special techniques are applied to speed up the process.

> “The only technique for accelerating the natural trend of social evolution is that of applying spiritual pressure from above, thus augmenting moral insight while enhancing the soul capacity of every mortal to understand and love every other mortal.” ([UB 52:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p6_7))

> “But you should not become discouraged by the apparently slow progress of the kingdom idea on Urantia. Remember that the order of progressive evolution is subjected to sudden and unexpected periodical changes in both the material and the spiritual worlds. The bestowal of Jesus as an incarnated Son was just such a strange and unexpected event in the spiritual life of the world.” ([UB 170:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_14))

Events out of the ordinary often prove to be a stumbling block on Urantia.

> “Slavery to tradition produces stability and cooperation by sentimentally linking the past with the present, but it likewise stifles initiative and enslaves the creative powers of the personality. The whole world was caught in the stalemate of traditionbound mores when the Caligastia one hundred arrived and began the proclamation of the new gospel of individual initiative within the social groups of that day. But this beneficent rule was so soon interrupted that the races never have been wholly liberated from the slavery of custom; fashion still unduly dominates Urantia.” ([UB 66:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p6_2))

In light of the reality of sudden, drastic, far-reaching changes in the course of our evolution at this crucial time, we can certainly use guidelines and directions, even though we have _The URANTIA Book_. The last message received, concerning the release of _The URANTIA Book_, came in January 1955. A Being who identified himself as Norson made the following statement: “I am a Melchizedek. I am Planetary Prince of Urantia. While I am not positive that now is the time to publish these Papers, you may publish them if you receive no further communications from me before the first of October of this year.”

_The URANTIA Book_ revelation has been given out ahead of its time and because it is incomplete and partial in itself, additional revelation and information are presently given. In our opinion it is this information that has been shared in the newsletter. Of course this information has to be scrutinized and carefully assessed, but should not be rejected outright because some have no place for it in their comfortable, established mode of thinking. Much of this information is in accordance with _The URANTIA Book_, but it requires discipline and study, cross-reference reading, comparing, contemplating, consulting inner guidance, in order to come to some informed conclusion.

In regard to Neil's questions we can only positively affirm that the Six-O-Six has, as never before, stimulated the exploration of new ideas and concepts, all related to _The URANTIA Book_ concept. In fact, it has made _The URANTIA Book_ even more interesting and has given it an extended meaning, value and challenge.

There are many hints in _The URANTIA Book_ of great impending changes soon to occur. To pick a few:

* **Description of the perfect life**

* **Detailed textbook-like information about social, political, economical and spiritual structure in the future to occur on this planet.**

* **Scientific, astronomical information (revelation) to be applied once our system is fully reconnected with the rest of the Universe** (apparently this has recently occurred).

“The knowledge which man most needs for survival and the conquest of his environment, is scientific knowledge of his universe and a living philosophy which will unite all humankind in one brotherhood. The purpose in giving this new knowledge is to consummate a marriage between science and religion which will give to the world its peace, happiness and culture, that only full awareness of the divine light, which is within all men, can bring.”

From: “_Atomic Suicide?_” by Dr. Walter and Lao Russell, University of Science and Philosophy.

- [UB 101:5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p5) — Religion Expanded by Revelation
- [UB 103:7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7) — Science and Religion

or see Concordex — “Science”

* **Description of a neighbouring planet**

And the list can go on and on. It would be ignorant to place the actuality of this information into the far distant future.

**_The URANTIA Book_ is a “Fifth” Epochal Revelation** although given before its time, to those who are ready for it, long before its world-wide mission.

To quote 2 paragraphs from the Divine Letters Latent:

> 1. _The URANTIA Book_ is a feature of the progressive evolution of human society.
> 
> It is not germane to the **spectacular episodes of epochal revolution.**
> 
> The book **belongs to the era immediately to follow the conclusion of the present ideological struggle.**
> 
> That will be the day when men will be willing to seek truth and righteousness.
> 
> **When the chaos** of the present confusion has passed, it will be more readily possible to formulate the cosmos of a new and improved era of human relationships.
> 
> And it is for this better order of affairs on earth that the book has been made ready.
> 
> 2. In the meantime thousands of study groups must be brought into existence. Thus will the Book be in readiness to **comfort and enlighten** the peoples of the world when **the battle for man's liberty** is finally won and the world is once more made safe for the religion of Jesus and the **freedom of mankind**. (Emphases added)
> 
> Copyright 1973, URANTIA Foundation.

As for our changing needs — additional new information emphasises the importance of our spiritual growth. To get close to our Thought Adjuster, the divine I AM presence within, by means of daily meditation, prayer, worship and actually living it.

We have to be on guard not to fall into the trap of over-intellectualizing the teaching of _The URANTIA Book_ to the detriment of the spiritual message it contains. There is a lot we don't know. Don't assume, but discriminate and master it.

### Hitchhiking

There is an experience to be had by hitchhiking. Compared to the relative neatness of the time schedule associated with punctual transport systems, hitchhiking is arduous and unpredictable. Some would call it unreliable, and it is if you haven't the time.

In adapting to the time-scale of hitchhiking one experiences travail. Emotional swings can be quite radical. For example, the eagerness and anticipation of adventure which you may think you have at the beginning might soon turn sour as car after car after car drives by and your impatience becomes more acute. Frustration and annoyance mount and all sorts of nasties threaten to leap from the mouth. Unnoticed at first, uncertainty chips away at the stoic intellect.

All of this might be so distressing that the hitchhiker decides to catch a bus. But he might, through a mysterious inner urge which he may simply call “craziness”, continue in this painful exercise. Having set himself a goal, he might simply persevere with the project.

At times I have begged in desperation, danced, showed a leg, acted the clown. Other times I have stared in raw, calm ferocity. Still other times I have smiled in nice “friendliness”. But as the sun passes across the sky and the cars continue by, the hitchhiker's weariness begins to predominate and the once “eager adventurer” has become a forlorn blob — ha-ha!

It might take a few days, but eventually the hitchhiker arrives at ground-zero within himself. All of his emotive antics exhausted, his attempts at procurement thwarted, his stoicism eroded away, he sits on the side of the road somewhere while going nowhere. And as he sits, he thinks. Seeing his folly, he renounces his gaining ideas. Having done so he continues his journey as an Initiate. Having discovered the “pearl of great price” (Matt 13:456) he discovers patience. Truly it is written:

> “Defeat is the true mirror in which you may honestly view your real self.” ([UB 156:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_17))

**Dave Budgerigar, Jan Juc, via Torquay, Victoria**

### I Dreamt

I dreamt death cane the other night 
And heaven's gale swing wide:
With kindly grace an angel came. 
And ushered me inside.
And then to my astonishment
Saw folk I'd known on earth:
Some I had judged as quite unfit. 
Or of little worth.
Indignant words rose to my lips 
But never were set free,
for even face showed stunned surprise. 
No one expected me!
