_The drafting of organizational documents is now being processed by the Trustees. The Trustees would like Friends of the Foundation to be involved during these early stages and they are seeking ways to make this happen. We will keep you informed of further developments_

**No Reply**

_We had hoped to publish a response from the Foundation Trustees commenting on allegations made in a letter by Mo Siegel reprinted in the May/June issue. To date, no correspondence has been forthcoming._

## So They Say

**Omega Science Digest**

Science has released many minds from ignorance, prejudice and superstition, revealing an incredible reservoir of inventiveness and creativity. This surely gives us at least a fighting chance to make a better world.

**The Economist**

Success in this game [major powers vying for national advantage] will now be measured in market share rather than in territory, and that trading blocs will replace alliances, and commerce will be the continuation of warfare by other means.

**Australian National University Research**

A single person needs to earn $70,000 per annum to be as happy as a married person on a family income of $20,000 and who goes to church regularly.

**The Australian**

[Australia] has developed an industry in promoting Aboriginal religion, in much the same way as Buddhism has had its upsurge in Western practice, and Hinduism its new wave of devotees years ago in the Vedanta for Western Man.

**Australian Society Magazine**

The family is the central image and reference point in the political sales pitch, no less than for the supermarket with family-size everything.

**New Statesman**

The war between Christendom and Islam may have experienced a long truce, but it is the oldest war of all. Europe's boundary to the east may be a lot easier to settle than its boundary to the south.

## Letters To Editor

### Reply To “Epochal Revolt”

_by Kathleen Swadling, Sydney_

I would like to comment on the article entitled “Epochal Revolt” by Irene and Wolfgang Borutta in the last issue of Six-O-Six. These writers stated: “_The URANTIA Book_ revelation has been given out ahead of its time and because it is incomplete and partial in itself, additional revelation and information are presently given”. I would first like to qualify what is meant by “partial” and “incomplete”. On UB 92:4.9 of _The URANTIA Book_ it states:

> “The papers, of which this is one, constitute the most recent presentation of truth to the mortals of Urantia. These papers differ from all previous revelations, for they are not the work of a single universe personality but a composite presentation by many beings. But no revelation short of the attainment of the Universal Father can ever be complete. All other celestial ministrations are no more than partial, transient and practically adapted to local conditions in time and space.” [UB 92:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_9)

So “partial” and “incomplete” in this sense is relative to absolute revelation of the Universal Father. For all intents and purposes the Urantia revelation services our needs for our current stage of evolution.

The fact that _The URANTIA Book_ itself states that it is partial and incomplete has been used by the writers of “Epochal Revolt” to justify that anything else which claims to be channelled by well known characters out of _The URANTIA Book_ must be a continuation of this incomplete revelation. This line of thinking states that because _The URANTIA Book_ was given before its time and is incomplete then we should stay in tune for more to come. This provides a convenient “in” for new channellings to be given credibility. I find this form of reasoning and deduction illogical and farcical. The writers have used the statement from _the URANTIA Book_: “_Remember that the order of progressive evolution is subjected to sudden and unexpected periodical changes..._” ([UB 170:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_14)) to give further credit that the recent channellings are part of the major revelation. Are we falling into the trap of being wonder seekers? Is not the Big Blue Book sudden and unexpected enough for us? Is it not spectacular enough to be a revelation of significance which has the power to impact on the spiritual upliftment of our world? Let's remember that all past revelations were not very spectacular for their time either. The arrival of the Planetary Prince and his staff of one hundred would have proceeded unwitnessed. Adam and Eve's arrival was likewise unspectacular for that era. Machiventa's arrival was quiet and unspectacular and he unobtrusively set up a learning centre. Jesus's appearance was certainly very natural and even his public ministry years were not unusual as the Jews were renowned for having spiritual teachers and preachers addressing crowds of people. _The URANTIA Book_ arrived and was published at a time when works claiming to have extra-terrestrial origin were in fashion. Yet all these major epochal revelations have been “sudden and unexpected” and have had a remarkable impact on the spiritual progression of mankind. Once it has been given to us it takes time for its impact to become apparent. Let's not become too impatient by expecting a new spiritual breakthrough to deviate from the laws of slow evolution. Surely _The URANTIA Book_ has given us enough to go on with for a long time to come. The life and teachings of Jesus as portrayed in _The URANTIA Book_ is a complete revelation in itself to man's hungry soul and should give us enough challenges to revolutionise the spiritual evolution of mankind if enough committed individuals become second milers, leaders and teachers — if those who are committed would actively apply the teachings to their lives and live as ambassadors for the Kingdom. Let's not get side-tracked into looking for easier and quicker methods which might have more immediate appeal to the masses and be beneficial in the short term but could be just as devastating as the Adamic default if we revert to the miraculous rather than the spiritual teachings. Possibly some of the confused philosophies of the “New Age” movement adapted to fit in with _The Urantia Book_ may be the biggest threat to its true spiritual teachings that reveal the methods and the nature and character of God. 

### Help!

I have been keenly interested in tapes produced by William Sadler Jnr., so much so that I have been transcribing them. But, lo and behold, some-one told me that this has already been done by some other soul. Is it you or some-one you know? I would appreciate your sending any information you might have to me.

## News Around The World

### Scientific Symposium 11

Information is slowly dribbling in on the proceedings of the symposium that took place in May at Oklahoma City. One courageous paper was presented by Dr Phil Calabrese who has had the recklessness to attempt to reconcile some scattered information given in _The URANTIA Book_ on the structure of Paradise, space and non-space, ultimatons, electrons, etc.

Phil has utilised a branch of mathematics known as topology, an art-form that has the strange attribute of being able to convert a doughnut into a milk jug. Both shapes can be formed from a piece of clay with a hole in the middle. With patience and a block of plasticine, you can do it yourself. Having had the practice, take your plasticine, stretch it to infinity, envelop that object, and flatten the resultant into an ellipsoidal, non-spatial Paradise containing infinity. Take a small piece of plasticine, form it into a non-spatial hole, surround it with a spinning soap bubble, and you have an ultimaton, complete with a non-spatial Paradise nucleus.

Next you position yourself in the central hole of your ultimaton along with a bubble pipe and blow 99 spinning bubbles, one inside the other. Now you have an electron. Keep it small however, as an electron appears to have no spatial dimensions — a fitting attribute for something (?) that surrounds a non-spatial hole. Repeat the process, ad infinitum, and you can actually create a universe.

### Planet From A Different Sun Found

At last the first discovery has been made of a planet outside of our own solar system. The find was made by a team from the University of Manchester in England which included an Australian astronomer, Mr Matthew Bailes.

The discovery was made by using the powerful Lovell radio telescope which revealed a neutron star, the pulsar PSR 1829-10, which is accompanied by a planet with an orbit period of approximately six months. The planet is ten times the mass of Earth and in a circular orbit with a radius the same size of Venus's orbit around the sun.

A new technique was used whereby the planet was detected by the way it slows down and speeds up the usually regular bursts of radiation from the pulsar.

Although it is highly unlikely that the planet sustains life, interestingly enough it has stimulated debate as to the possibility of life on other planets! This discovery really is a major breakthrough for science and another feather in the cap for our Big Blue Book.

### The Art Of Living

### What Is Spiritual?

_by Trevor Swadling, Sydney_

Although out there amongst our fellow men, there is a lot of confusion on just what is spiritual, the way to God consciousness, enlightenment, the path or technique, it seems to me that God as a personality is knowable and therefore God-seeking people should have something in common with their experiences. Throughout the years, contact with my fellow men has personally affirmed that this is true; after all if we had a dear friend that we both knew, according to the degree and length of our relationship with them, surely there would be aspects about their nature and character that we had both come to recognized and admired.

The definition of spiritual from the dictionary is: “relating to the spirit and not to physical nature or matter” also the definition given to spirituality is: “the state or quality of being dedicated to God, religion, or spiritual things or values, especially as contrasted with material or temporal ones.” _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that “God is spirit” “the first source and centre of all things and beings”. It tells us that God is perfect, eternal, an infinite pure spirit personality. From this we could deduce that our personal concepts of what is spiritual is our understanding of our relationship with God, and through the sincere attempts that we endeavour to live these values is the true standing of the reality of that relationship. _The URANTIA Book_ implies that this is the technique whereby man, in his personal spiritual evolution, transfers his seat of identity from the temporal to the eternal. So what is spiritual?

What does _The URANTIA Book_ say on this subject? Well as we know large portions of the Book are dedicated to revealing the nature and character of spiritual realities, with part four solely dedicated to this end for our personal benefit. _The URANTIA Book_ is a great tool in helping us in our endeavours seek and do the will of God. Man needs revelation whether it be personal or otherwise.Without it we could, so to speak — be paddling up the wrong (so called) spiritual creek with icy-pole sticks in a barb-wire canoe.

_The URANTIA Book_ is one of those (from my point of view, the greatest) means to this end but by no means should we look at it as an end in itself. There is a statement in the Bible that says: “there is a way that seems right to man but in the end is death”. _The URANTIA Book_ expounds on this from within its symphony of cosmology, philosophy and religion, stating that there is an adventurous path ordained by God whereby man ascends eventually to become Godlike and this technique for developing a personal relationship with God is finally and exquisitely portrayed in the life and teachings of Jesus. Therefore I feel, as pertaining to our growth It can be truly said: “He is the way the truth and the life”. To my fellow URANTIA Book readers and all others, I tip my hat to you all, and all the best in your attempt to seek and to share spiritual realities.

### Science And Religion

## Extremes Of Believing As A Little Child

_By Matt Neibaur_

“No holy Bible offered to the Western world in the past few centuries is thicker, heavier, or stranger than _The Urantia Book_. This 2,097 page, 4.3 lb. volume purports to be written entirely by extra-terrestrials and channelled through an unknown earthling. To members of the Urantia Brotherhood, a quietly growing cult headquartered in Chicago, the book supposedly contains the earth's fifth revelation from God, superior to mainline Christianity and destined to transform the world.”

“Nothing could persuade me to read every line of this monstrous mishmash of claptrap interspersed with puddles of pious platitudes, but I have perused it carefully enough to get the drift of its wild science-fiction, themes. In a way, the book is more amusing than the Book of Mormon, translated from hieroglyphics by Joseph Smith with the aid of a pair of magic spectacles called the Urim and the Thummim. It is almost as funny as the ravings of L. Ron Hubbard or Sun Moon, the channelled fiddlefaddle of Jane Roberts or J. Zebra Knight, or the work of such earlier mountebanks as Mary Baker Eddy and Madame Blavatsky. Indeed it may be the largest, most fantastic chunk of channelled moonshine ever to be bound in one volume.”

So says Martin Gardner in “The Great Urantia Mystery”, Sceptical Inquirer magazine, Winter 1990.

How is it possible that Gardner's view and my own diverse so radically? Why did I have a religious experience, and he didn't? Was I too gullible or was he too sceptical — cynical. Of course, I cannot answer this question unbiasedly. I can only state unequivocally, my own experience has left me changed.

There are two extremes of thought represented by the sceptic and the gullible believer. And there are problems with taking either position without a careful balance. I gave a talk to a group of believers in paranormal psychology not too long ago. I was struck at how anything that was presented was immediately accepted. On the other hand, there are the sceptics who become so dogmatic in their position that they close their mind to the realm of new possibilities. Their close mindedness borders on absurdity. _The gullible believer assumes that since anything is possible, anything is likely. The sceptic assumes that since nothing is possible, nothing is likely_. Both assumptions, in the extreme are false. In fact, the sceptic has a duty to enlighten the religious community by destroying the mythology and superstition surrounding religion. The religionist has the obligation to elevate society by instilling a moral conscience into its members — including sceptics in the sciences.

Perhaps the most exciting aspect of _The URANTIA Book_ is the integration of science and religion. At no point are we asked to accept any of it on blind faith. In fact, just the opposite is true:

> “Faith has falsified its trust when it presumes to deny realities and to confer upon its devotees' assumed knowledge. Faith is a traitor when it fosters betrayal of intellectual integrity and belittles loyalty to supreme values and divine ideals.” ([UB 101:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p8_3))

> “The materialistic scientist and the extreme idealist are destined always to be at loggerheads. This is not true of those scientists and idealists who are in possession of a common standard of high moral values and spiritual test levels. In every age, scientists and religionists must recognise that they are on trial before the bar of human need. They must eschew all welfare between themselves while they strive valiantly to justify their continued survival by enhanced devotion to the service of human progress. If the so-called science or religion of any age is false, then must it either purify its activities or pass away before the emergence of a material science or spiritual religion of a truer and more worthy order.” ([UB 132:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p1_4)).

> “What both developing science and religion need is more searching and fearless self-criticism, a greater awareness of incompleteness in evolutionary status. The teachers of both science and religion are often too self-confident and dogmatic. Science and religion can only be self-critical of their facts. The moment departure is made from the stage of facts, reason abdicates or else rapidly degenerates into a consort of false logic.” ([UB 103:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p7_7))

After my experience, I felt like Tolstoy, “I want to understand, so that any instance of the incomprehensible occurs as a necessity of reason and not as an obligation to believe.” I realised that at the centre of the experience was a mystery that I could not touch. But I wanted to know all else. Validate it in my own experience, accept on faith only that which can be known in no other way.

_(Extract from a paper by Dr Matt Neibaur that presents scientific material supportive of the Book's claim to be revelatory.)_

### Linguistics

### Universal Language Brain-Teasers

_By Patije Mills, Sarasota, Florida_

A few months ago, Connie Lester (Englewood, Florida) tickled my imagination by mentioning a possibility of “de-coding” the meaning of “Orvonton”. Since then I've had many such possibilities “pop into” my intrigued imagination. We have lots of fun speculating and I want to share the following information to see if any of you might have also uncovered these possibilities.

Is there a rhythm or pattern in words introduced to us by the Revelators? Is it possible that we are being introduced to the Universe, or System Language by the means of _The URANTIA Book_?

First it was suggested that many, if not most, of the nouns are pronounced with the accent on the second syllable. For instance:

Or-von’-ton, U-ran’-tia, Mon-ma’tia, U-ver’-sa, Norlat’-ia-dek, Sol-ar’-ing-ton, Fin-al’-it-ers, E-den’-tia, Havon’-a, Sa-tan’-ia.

Is it just a coincidence, or is there another level to this teaching when certain syllables are used as follows:

Orvonton = our Super Universe — note: _the URANTIA Book_ indicates that the supreme will reside on Uversa, so Orvonton will be (is?) the Superuniverse home of the Supreme.
- Or = of the Supreme?
- On = (in the middle of a word) = of the Son?
- On = (at the end of a word) = of the Father?
- Onton = of the Father and the Son with the Spirit?
- Orvonton = The Supreme Universe of the Father, Son and Spirit.

Monota = The living, non-spirit energy of Paradise; energy system of the Universal Father (471).
-Mo = System, or philosophy?
-On = Of the Son
-No = ???
-Ta= Living, non-spirit energy
-Monota = Living non-spiritual Energy System of the Son?

Mota = High levels of cosmic insight/more than a superior philosophy — it has a stereoscopic effect on meanings and values ([UB 48:7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7)).
- Mo = System, or philosophy?
- Ta= Living non-spirit Energy
- Mota = Living non-spiritual Energy Philosophy System?

Ultimata = smallest particle of living, non-spiritual energy, or materialised energy. 
- Ul = extreme?
- Ti = small?
- Ma = (matter?) purpose, State of Being
- Ta = Living, non-spiritual energy?
- Ultimata = Extremely small living energy materialised?

If ‘A’ or ‘TA’ is living, non-spiritual energy, could ‘Tia’ be a place of materialised energy? For instance:
- Urantia = our planet
- Ur = our chemistry name???
- An = Person, place or a state of being?
- Tia = Materialised energy?
- Urantia = This place of materialised energy, our planet?

Other examples: Edentia, Monmatia, Sandmatia, Assuntia, Veluntia, Salsatia, etc. A possible exception might be Morontia but perhaps not:

Morontia = State of being between pure material and pure spiritual? (But the other preceding syllables may change the meaning???)
- M or Mo= ?? System or philosophy
- Or = of the Supreme
- On = of the son (Ont = of the Son with)
- Tia = materialised energy?
- Morontia = a system of Materialised energy of the Son with the Supreme as ???

(or)

- Mo = System or Philosophy
- Or = of the Supreme
- On = of the Son
- Tia = Materialised energy
- Morontia = System of the Supreme energizing through the Creator Son?

Using this line of reasoning, ‘Dek’ then, would seem to be a type of power or authority. For instance: Norlatiadek, Melchizedek, Voronadek, Lanonadek, Chronoldeks... each a type of power or authority, specialised by the other preceding syllables, perhaps?

Likewise, ‘El’ seems to mean ‘special Son of the Father’ or ‘special Son of the Son’. For instance:
- Michael = Creator Son
- M = order of being?
- I = first?
- Ch = One who knows? (with a ‘Cha’ = Creator/ruler) (with ‘Chiz’ = Teacher/professor/leader)
- El = Son of the Father
- Michael = Creator Son of the Father/Ruler?

Other ‘El’ syllables include: Ang-el, Immanu-el, Gabri-el, Archang-el-s, Evan-gel-s, El-el-yon, M-elchizedek, and even Be-el-zabub!

Isn't this fascinating?

Please write to me if your imagination is also stimulated and/or you have discovered some of the codes!!!

## The Book, Study And Discussion

**Article from a computer-interactive program in the Brotherhood of Man Library**

### What Does _The Urantia Book_ Say About The Will Of God?

Speaking to Nicodemus, Jesus said:

> “_If you would be led by this spirit from above, very soon would you begin to see with the eyes of the spirit, and then by the wholehearted choice of spirit guidance would you be born of the spirit since your only purpose in living would be to do the will of your Father who is Heaven. And so finding yourself born of the spirit and happily in the kingdom of God, you would begin to bear in your daily life the abundant fruits of the spirit._” ([UB 142:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p6_7))

That does not leave you humans much room to manoeuvre. But what is implied by ‘doing the will of God?’ I am going to let the Book do all the answering, at least most of it. The first thing is to get this earth life of yours into its right perspective. You must know by now that the book uses some pretty strange names for various celestial beings and groups thereof. Maybe that is because they have been translated from another language and culture. Whatever, there is a group of seraphim called the Quickeners of Morality who have this to say:

> “_Your short sojourn on Urantia, on this sphere of mortal infancy, is only a single link, the very first in the long chain that is to stretch across universes and through the eternal ages. It is not so much what you leam in this first life: it is the experience of living this life that is important. Even the work of this world, paramount though it is, is not nearly so important. as the way in which you do this work._”
> 
> “_The keys to the kingdom of heaven are: sincerity, more sincerity, and more sincerity. All men have these keys. Men use them — advance in spirit status by decisions, by more decisions, and by more decisions. The highest moral choice is the choice of the highest possible value, and always — in any sphere, in all of them — this is to choose to do the will of God. If man thus chooses, he is great, though he be the humblest citizen of Jerusem or even the least of mortals on Urantia._” ([UB 39:4.13-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p4_13))

The perspective you are now supposed to have is that this earth life is but the beginning and to make the most of it, you need lots of experience involving decisions in which doing the will of God is of importance. Like deciding which is your favourite brand of beer, or the colour of your new dress. I joke, I think. Actually computers do neither. You now know what is important, but how, when, and where does one ‘do the will of God’. Back to the Book.

> “_Never forget there is only one adventure which is more satisfying and thrilling than the attempt to discover the will of the living God, and that is the supreme experience of honestly trying to do that divine will. And fail not to remember that the will of God can be done in any earthly occupation. Some callings are not holy and others secular. All things are sacred in the lives of those who are spirit led; that is, subordinated to truth, ennobled by love, dominated by mercy, and restrained by fairness justice. The spirit which my Father and I shall send into the world is not only the Spirit of Truth but also the spirit of idealistic beauty._” ([UB 155:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_11))

Well that quotation told you when and where to choose to do the will of God, and if you remember the first quote, it is said that if you so choose, even the least of mortals on Urantia is great. So being important, being a great achiever, being rich and successful, none of that counts for much unless it happened to be the will of God for you. On [UB 108:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p4_2), the Book says, “**the Adjusters are the will of God,**” and the next quotation expands on that theme.

> “_In the universes God the Father is, in potential, the overcontroller of matter, mind, and spirit. Only by means of his far-flung personality circuit does God deal directly with the personalities of his vast creation of will creatures, but he is contactable (outside of Paradise) only in the presences of his fragmented entities, the will of God abroad in the universes. This Paradise spirit that indwells the minds of the mortals of time and there fosters the evolution of the immortal soul of the surviving creature is of the nature and divinity of the Universal Father. But the minds of such evolutionary creatures originate in the local universes and must gain divine perfection by achieving those experiential transformations of spiritual attainment which are the inevitable result of a creature's choosing to do the will of the Father in heaven._” ([UB 1:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p3_6))

Obviously you mortals have got it made if you can just figure out how you should do the will of God. John asked the right question of Jesus. John asked Jesus, “Master, what is the kingdom of heaven?” and Jesus answered:

> “_The kingdom of heaven consists of these three essentials: first, recognition of the fact of the sovereignty of God; second, belief in the truth of sonship with God; and third, faith in the effectiveness of the supreme human desire to do the will of God — to be like God. And this is the good news of the gospel: that by faith every mortal may have all these essentials of salvation._” ([UB 140:10.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_9))

So the desire to do the will of God equates with seeking to be like God. Now we are getting somewhere.

> “_That evening while teaching in the house, for it had begun to rain, Jesus talked at great length, trying to show the twelve what they must be, not what they must do. They knew only a religion that imposed the doing of certain things as the means of attaining righteousness — salvation. But Jesus would reiterate, ‘In the kingdom you must be righteous in order to do the work.’ Many times did he repeat, 'Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect._” ([UB 140:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_1))

“Being” must precede “doing”. You will do the will of God if and when you are like God! But what is Godlike?

> “_And then said Jesus: You will stumble over my teaching because you are wont to interpret my message literally; you are slow to discern the spirit of my teaching. Again must you remember that you are my messengers; you are beholden to live your lives as I have in spirit lived mine. You are my personal representatives; but do not err in expecting all men to live as you do in every particular. Also must you remember that I have sheep not of this flock, and that I am beholden to them also, to the end that I must provide for them the pattern of doing the will of God while living the life of the mortal nature._” ([UB 140:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p6_8))

On UB 153:3.2 Jesus says:

“I have so lived this life in the flesh as to inspire all men likewise ever to seek to know and do the will of the indwelling heavenly Father.” [UB 153:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/153#p3_2)

So Jesus is your pattern, do not do as he did but to be as he was. Or in other words, know the life and teachings of Jesus, familiarise yourself with the mind of Jesus, and seek to put on the nature of Jesus. Inasmuch as you succeed in putting on the nature of Jesus, you will be like God, hence you will do the will of god. The key to _The URANTIA Book_ teaching about the will of God is ‘being’- every day just a little more, in nature, like Jesus.

So cease worrying about what you should do. If God has something special for you, be assured he will arrange for you to be confronted. Relax and serve as you pass by. And when you have a decision to make, ask yourself what Jesus would do in the same circumstances.

One last quote. In explaining the true meaning of the golden rule to Nathaniel, Jesus said:

> “And then last, but greatest of all, we attain the level of spirit insight and spiritual interpretation which impels us to recognise in this nule of life the divine command to treat all men as we conceive God would treat them. That is the universe ideal of human relationships. And this is your attitude toward all such problems when your supreme desire is ever to do the Father's will.” ([UB 147:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/147#p4_9))

### He Seemed Possessed

_by The Sunshine Coast Study Group, Queensland_

Reading in _the URANTIA Book_ in an unfamiliar foreign language (French) may cause one to ponder about things that are passed over thoughtlessly in one's native tongue. These words had that effect. “Jesus montrait tant d'audace et d'energie dans ces annonces que meme Pierre, Jacques, et Jean furent tentes de croire qu'il ne se possedait plus.” Literal translation gives: “Jesus was showing so much audacity and energy in these announcements that even Peter, James and John were tempted to believe that he was no more possessing himself.” After consulting a French/English dictionary this became “he was no longer in control of himself.”

Instant recall brought these words to mind: “Never became fanatical, well- balanced intellectual judgements, perfectly endowed, magnificently co- ordinated,” etc. ([UB 196:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_7)), and on the same page where the strange words were observed, “Il n'etait jamais agite, vexe, ou deconcerte” — he was never agitated, vexed or disconcerted.

It was study group day, so the problem was turned over to the group — what was so important as to bring our master to the point of appearing to be mentally disturbed? These are the points the study group came up with:

1. Jesus is telling them that he desires that his disciples so live in the world that men, by ‘seeing’ their lives, will become kingdom conscious and hence be led to inquire of believers concerning the ways of the kingdom.
2. Their only business is to reveal God to the individual man as his Father, to lead him to become son-conscious and to present him to God as his faith son.
3. The religion of Jesus is wholly based on the living of his bestowal life on earth. His life is our pattern for becoming ‘like God’.
4. He left behind no books, laws, or other forms of human organization affecting the religious life of the individual.
5. The only reward Jesus holds out is: in this world spiritual joy and divine communion; in the next — eternal life in the progress of the divine spirit realities of the Father.
6. Salvation by faith alone and attainment of human liberty through sincere recognition of revealed truth.
7. Jesus promises to send his Spirit of Truth to all men after his return to the Father.
8. He is projecting to them a **plan for a new age**.

No wonder he was excited. This was the core of his teachings for the Fourth Epochal Revelation.

We failed the plan. So, almost 2,000 years later, the secondary midwayers managed to induce our celestial supervisors to give us another go. The result — the Fifth Epochal Revelation. What will we do with it? Or to it?

## The Forum

### Into Our Hands...

_We know how the Book came to be. We'd like to believe we know what's in it. We think we know why it has been given to us._

_But now that we have it:_

_What do we do with it?_

_How do we do it?_

_More importantly, once we've had that flash of inspiration, or a ponderous analysis over a decade, where do we say it?_

_In THE FORUM._

_Let's focus our attention on URANTIA Book directions beyond a circumscribed viewpoint. Hard to believe, but we are guiding an epochal revelation in a well-ordered universal system._

_When our free will can pull rank on every celestial authority, we had better realise the responsibility that we take on._

_In this springtime of our spiritual destinies, let's see what we can achieve; not forgetting that it is also the springtime of another destiny — that of this Fifth Epochal Revelation to this planet._

_Take a moment to reflect upon the destiny of revelations one, two, three and four._

_The summer of the fifth is now linked with each and every one of us._

_THE FORUM offers scope for lively debate, intellectual theorising, good old common sense, and, above all else, honest reasoning._

_It is time we created the future in a constructive manner. Let's give some structured planning, some practical coordinated administration, to support the untiring efforts of the Spirit of Truth._

_Where is this epochal revelation going? Does anybody really know? If we are independent and edified thinkers then surely we should be able to outline diverse and brilliant ways to proceed._

_And should our concepts be elevated so as to contain unerring wisdom, then perhaps they may be embraced by the many, thus unifying our energies._

_Apart from giving the midwayers a mild heart attack, and making the Revelatory Commission rush for their pens, wanting to write for THE FORUM, surely our efforts would be celebrated. Let's just settle for making Michael proud of us._

### An Analysis Of The Kristen Maaherra Case

_by Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

An analysis ‘at a distance’ has both advantages and disadvantages. It may be more objective but contain less fact than when made as an ‘inside job’. The case appears to have its roots in far distant days of the Urantia movements, well before the date of the Book's publication in 1955.

The core of the problem is a divergence of opinion on how the Book should be disseminated. On the one side are those who would use modern communication and sales techniques to spread the Book relatively quickly. On the other, are those who believe the Book was given to us well before its time in order to be studied intensively for perhaps one hundred years. This would be a period of preparation for a more intensive campaign at a much later date.

Both these groups have become secretive and elitist. The total numbers for both sides who are ‘inner circle’ members may be less than twenty. Many have close links with relatives and friends from the days of the ‘Seventy’ and the ‘Forum’. Effective power in both the ex-Brotherhood and the Foundation has always resided with these two groups. Outsiders are occasionally admitted, and made to feel that they are a part of a privileged class. The operations of the group pay scant attention to the needs or opinions of ‘outsiders’ — the bulk of the devotees. This is the norm for human organizations of all types.

> The operations of the group pay scant attention to the needs or opinions of ‘outsiders’ — the bulk of the devotees.

Members of these groups have held office in both the Brotherhood and the Foundation. Recently, there has been a clear schism, with the ‘liberals’ holding power in the Brotherhood (now FEF) and the ‘conservatives’ in the Foundation.

Where does Kristen Maaherra fit into all of this? She is the meat in the sandwich. The strategy being employed by both sides in the power struggle is to bleed the other to death, current policy to bring this about through depletion of funds. The law courts have become the battle ground, and the beneficiaries are the lawyers. Kristen and J.J. are simply ‘fall guys’ — their involvement is largely accidental, accepted by both parties because it serves the purposes of each.

The strategy has backfired. Neither group anticipated the stand of Kristen on the basis of the first amendment guaranteeing freedom of religion. This stand now threatens the copyright and the trademarks. Loss of these does not suit either side, at least not the inner circles, as both want control of the printing of the Book with the copyright intact.

Let us now examine facts, effects, and consequences. Firstly, a fact that is important to all Urantians — the requirement to keep the text of the Book inviolate. Until recently, outsider Urantians have been fed with the story that there has only ever been one minor change to the text and that this was quickly rectified in the next printing. Advances in computer technology now make it possible to scan the text of all printings and compare them for differences. The result, thanks to Kristen, has amazed us. Yes, most of the changes are in spelling and punctuation, but there are also changes in textual meanings that cannot be accounted for except as attempts to hide what were thought to be errors. Possibly these were made with the best of intentions. So was the folly of Eve. The changes are a betrayal of a trust that must be rectified. Sooner or later, outsider Urantians will demand that the original text be adhered to, inclusive of all errors. We simply cannot trust changes of any kind to human beings. An appendix to this eventual printing will be necessary to list changes to the earlier printings.

> The core of the problem is a divergence of opinion on how the Book should be disseminated. On the one side are those who would use modern communication and sales techniques to spread the Book relatively quickly. On the other, are those who believe the Book was given to us well before its time in order to be studied intensively for perhaps one hundred years.

The Trustees of the Foundation bear ultimate responsibility for the fact that such changes were permitted. However it is highly likely that knowledge of the extent of changes was shared by privileged individuals from both groups.

One effect of the long running dispute has been the dissipation of funds and effort. This is reflected in the excessive but highly selective attention paid to the protection of the copyright and the trademarks at the expense of duties enumerated in the Declaration of Trust, and others said to have been imposed by the Revelatory Commission. These include the development of a corps of skilled teachers, meaningful secondary works, and translations of the book. Other duties that have suffered are the requirement to promote the true teachings of Jesus to the peoples of the world, the gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man. It is possible that this long-standing feud was a pointless undertaking. An article by Richard Bain entitled ‘Time Bombs’ appeared in the newsletter ‘Cosmic Reflections 2 (2)’, and was republished in a booklet entitled ‘The Science Content of _The Urantia Book_’. The author drew attention to some of the strange errors in the Book that are difficult to account for in terms of the mandate, and concluded that these may have been included to prevent the Book becoming an object of worship. A second article ‘Time Bomb 2’ highlights some of the material in the Book that would be virtually indefensible in a public debate against skilled and hostile interviewers. This strange Book of ours is both self-authenticating for the faithful and self-destroying for those intent upon subjecting it to ridicule or rejection. It is extremely unlikely that the Book could survive for long as the focal point for any publicity campaign, at least for the foreseeable future. The wisdom of the Revelators is quite amazing.

To be considered are the potential consequences of the loss of the copyright, either because of the suggested illegalities associated with the proceedings to secure it, or because of the successful application of the first amendment. One of these is that a publisher would reprint the Book eliminating all the ‘funny’ parts, with or without the embellishments of modern advertising and salesmanship. Another possibility would be a comic strip presentation of sections of the Book, particularly that dealing with the life of Jesus. It is difficult to predict the outcome of such eventualities. It may not necessarily be bad.

This analysis may not be true in reality, though true in appearances. It gives rise to a speculation. There are approximately one quarter of a million books out there somewhere. The vast majority are gracing book shelves in an unread condition. They constitute a bottomless supply source for many years to come. Experience in Australia has demonstrated that we have no desperate need for organizations at all. Our annual general meetings arise from spontaneous offers by temporary state committees that disband after the meeting. Official organizations secularise a movement. Precedence for this discovery belongs to Alcoholics Anonymous whose lack of organization provides a useful example. Our Universe Ruler gave us this message:

> “Do not strive with men — always be patient. It is not your kingdom; you are only ambassadors. Simply go forth proclaiming: This is the kingdom of heaven — God is your Father and you are his sons, and this good news, if you whole-heartedly believe it, is your eternal salvation.” ([UB 141:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p6_4))

We really can simply ‘serve as we pass by’ and leave the overall directing of planetary affairs to our celestial supervisors. The Father needs us as individuals. Human organizations inevitably hinder his work.

## On Reflection

### Fools Rush In — And Angels Have To Follow

_by Ann Bendall_

As I view my day in retrospect I suspect being my seraphim must be a real chore. I am somewhat relieved that seraphim always work in pairs. At least they have someone to cheer them up, someone's shoulder to cry on when, exhausted, they heave a sigh of relief that another day is over.

How much laughter do they share with me, as I with Shakespearian stance dramatically view the minor obstacles of daily living? How many songs of joy do I compose so they can hum along? Do I, the fool, rush in whilst seraphim sit on the side-line shaking their heads, rolling up their celestial sleeves to pick up the pieces at the end of my risk taking?

No doubt the guardians have to square their shoulders, and with prayers for strength, resist hitting me over the head, have to run along behind screaming into my ears — “When will you start taking a modicum of responsibility? Why is it always up to us?”

Even more disturbing to my growing awareness, is that if I somehow appear up on the mansion worlds before my desired time, my poor seraphim are going to have to give a “please explain!”

Spare a little time for your seraphim. Give them a bit of fun today! Don't take unnecessary risks. My seraphim are very skilled at driving, but, boy do they get tired of having to do most of the steering and braking while I am creatively solving all of the problems of the world, overtaxing every other driver on the road.

I want my seraphim to laugh with good humour at my jokes, with me, the initiator of light-hearted humour. I want my seraphim to visit new places every day and not steel themselves for another trip into hell, as a result of my refusal to learn. I want my seraphim to be rewarded on the scene of their creation. I want to synchronise with their celestial plans. Not arriving too late. Too early. Or not at all. And removing the rose-coloured glasses. My seraphim deserve a little consideration and love. Maybe tomorrow!

### The More We Give, The More We're Given

_By Robert Crickett_

Of all the great disappointments which traverse the mortal heart, a terribly frustrating one must surely be that of desiring to serve in the kingdom of heaven according to the will of God, and having trouble getting off the starting block: “Woman of Sychar” stuff, in a sense.

Suzie is twenty one, a prostitute, grossly over weight, courting problems with heroin, alcohol and heart disease. She casts a tragic figure: essentially friendless, homeless and unable to return to her family nest because her father beats her when he's drunk and the other family members are prone to locking her out of sight in a room and forgetting about her: at least that's her story... but then, anyone who is set on doing nothing about their situation has their story, and they treasure it far above making a move for the better.

But as tragic as her situation seems there is one bright spot: she's a born again Christian. It occurred one Saturday. On the previous night she had been raped and mugged and quite literally left for dead on a city street. A young Christian woman found Suzie and took her home where she bathed her, nursed her, bandaged up her wounds, fed her, and spoke to her about the great love she had for Jesus — recommending that Suzie also open her heart to Him so that her life might be turned around. And it was. And that was five years ago.

So what went wrong? How born again must one become for a God- knowing life to revolutionise itself? Obviously a little more than however much Suzie grasped onto, yet, it's her final hope. She's a church nut! She'll praise the Lord with the best of them....but she'll do anything at all for that matter, so long as she can receive.

And that might just be the snag in the whole show, because the kingdom's about increasing the yield of the fruits of the spirit, and Suzie, like the rest of us, can only increase the yield by giving.

And when the giving stops, or never really starts, what else can the branch do but wither and fade away until the husbandman has no choice but to prune it off the vine? And what can the husbandman say? ‘I showed you how to have life. I showed you the joy of loving others and drawing up living waters out of them that you and they both might have life. Did you do that?’ ‘No....but I really wanted to.’ ‘Are you sure?’ ‘Yes! Yes!’ ‘Are you really sure?’ ‘Well....er....no....I guess I’ve never really been sure about anything.' SNIP.

### When All Is Said And Done...

> “While religion is exclusively a personal spiritual experience — knowing God as a Father — the corollary of this experience — knowing man as a brother — entails the adjustment of the self to other selves, and that involves the social or group aspect of religious life.” ([UB 99:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_1))
