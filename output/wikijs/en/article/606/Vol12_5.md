## Editor's Notebook

### A Request For Forward Planning

While the clamouring for more freedom of expression regarding the Book may appease some individuals (and damage the Foundation), issues central to the dissemination of the teachings are being ignored.

Are we continuing to be effective in our personal outreach programs? Do we feel we are part of a cohesive movement concerned for the spiritual welfare of our fellows?

During recent weeks, enquiries have been received at Six-O-Six from new readers. Information has also been requested for the formation of a study group and letters from overseas readers have requested copies of publications mentioned in Six-O-Six. People are eagerly seeking information, yet there is only so much that can be done by concerned individuals. Limitations of time and resources mean new readers and new study groups receive only minimum assistance.

It is also noted that the Fellowship has reduced the number of paid staff and is now more dependent on assistance from volunteers.

As a world movement, are we planning for the future? Would we be able to cope with a greater level of enquiry? What contingencies are in place to meet the outcome of the Foundation's action in the U.S., whatever it may be?

It is to be hoped that those people calling for changes could respond to ‘sudden’ events and oversee social progress, with damage control mechanisms in place.

The real work at the grass roots level will still be required — teachers, leaders, study group participants working away quietly. Surely the ownership of copyright and symbols has never, in itself, attracted ne iv readers.

The willing workers, however, may need support from a respected and professional organization which understands the marketplace, an organization that can bring harmony and motivation, one that can relate to the many religions, the media, all UB organizations and readers and one that addresses the longer term planning requirements for the shortcomings even now evident.

### The Story Of The Urantia Papers

A booklet entitled ‘Birth of a Revelation’ has been written by Mark Kulieke, a son of forum members and a long-time student of the Papers.

It gives an account of the history of the Urantia Papers from 1906 to 1955 and contains information published for the first time. Copies may be obtained ( $US5 plus $US1.25 handling) by contacting:

## So They Say

**The Australian**

Astrology is a substitute for religion. People running religions don't tend to absolve people of responsibility for their actions, whereas in a lot of these new-age things the only responsibility is to feel good about it. Astrology is the ultimate cop-out. It denies free choice.

**Omni**

The search for perfection cannot stop with genetic engineering. It demands the technological re-design of human life as a whole. It demands the creation of an artificial environment designed to protect us from all the natural inconveniences and hardships that make life less than perfect.

**Psychology Today**

Our changing society has brought with it changes in the social meaning of age-blurred boundaries between the periods of life, new definitions of age groups, new patterns in the timing of major life events and new inconsistencies in what is considered age-appropriate behaviour.

**Success Magazine**

Getting to governments is not the major priority. It's very difficult to change people's minds that are already made up. When you convince people at the grass roots

* level, governments, business, everything changes as a result.

## Letters To The Editor

### Virtually Indefensible

_by Norm Du Val, Montana, USA_

In the article by Ken Glasziou concerning the Kristen Maaherra case, Ken mentions another article called ‘Time Bombs2’ which contains URANTIA Book material that supposedly “would be virtually indefensible in a public debate against skilled and hostile interviewers.” Here's some rhetorical questions (and some not).

Does this mean we can't defend _The URANTIA Book_? And if not, why not? If we can't defend it, should we believe in it at all? Should we believe in something that may be ‘virtually indefensible’? Could Jesus himself defend it, and would he? Oh dear me, this sounds like a real problem, but is it? The answer is NO.

We know the planet is way off path. This has caused a distorted view of reality for most of the inhabitants of the earth. So what if you are in an interview with a ‘hostile’ questioner who has an askew view of the world? Everyone has different opinions about things. You are entitled to yours simply because you believe it. You don't have to explain anything to a ‘hostile’ person. You just tell him or her the way reality really is and let it go at that. That's what Jesus would do, and did. He didn't waste any time trying to defend his religion to ‘skilled and hostile’ interviewers. Perhaps “Don't throw your pearls before swine” applies. Not everyone is going to believe the Book. Nothing can be defended against ‘skilled and hostile’ people. Any belief system can be chopped into minced meat, ridiculed. The Bible easily comes to mind. Some believe that the earth was created in six days. Some believe that Jesus died for their sins. In the end, everyone believes what they want to believe.

What is there to ‘defend’ about _The URANTIA Book_? So what if some people don't like some of its ideas? You can't force people to accept the truth. Don't worry about it. This idea that some parts of _The URANTIA Book_ are ‘virtually indefensible’ is a red herring. Jesus ran into a lot of resistance and hostility. So will we.

Before reasonable, open minded and/or friendly people, time should be taken to explain some of the seemingly ‘troublesome or sensitive parts’, in the context that the Father loves all of his children on earth and He expects us to do the same. But we do not have to, and should not, apologise for the fact that _The URANTIA Book_'s view of reality is far more correct than the distorted views prevalent in the world today.

One other interesting point raised in Ken's article, in regards to the present trouble in the Urantian movement was his statement that, "The strategy being employed by both sides in the power struggle is to bleed the other to death, current policy being to bring this about through depletion of funds." I think it is an error to assume that just because two groups have differing ideas, that both are equally wrong or that both have the same strategy and policy regarding the other. It is very unlikely. Ken also suggests we don't need an organization. This is an interesting idea, but I think it is also incorrect. Even Jesus had an organization. What we need is a good one.

### Contact With The Sedona Group

_By Connie Lester, Englewood, Florida_

About five months ago my friend Norma Hays and I contacted Sananda — White Cloud after reading about the article ‘Caligastia’s Visit' in the Six-O-Six. Sananda White Cloud put us in contact with the one who calls himself Gabriel of Sedona. We never suspected, nor was it ever our intent, to expose or reveal any of them.

Norma sent all of them a card and enclosed a snapshot of herself and her three children. The one who calls himself Gabriel told Norma he took one look at her picture and knew she had numerous ‘Past Lives’ and was alive at the time of Michael's seventh bestowal and knew him personally. _The URANTIA Book_ is perfectly clear on this olden erroneous doctrine about past lives (see [UB 86:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/86#p4_5), paragraphs 5-6, especially 6, and [UB 164:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/164#p3_1) under the sub-heading ‘Healing the blind beggar’). They don't use the word reincarnation — they substitute words such as ‘transmigration’, ‘transmutation’ and ‘repersonalization’.

Sedona, Arizona, is a virtual ‘disneyland’ of mystics, channellers, trance prophets and the like, and in order to make a ‘living’ off of the ‘believers’, these ‘channellers’ need a hook, something that makes them just a bit different. And the one who calls himself Gabriel is using _The URANTIA Book_ as a hook, a tool in order to get donations. The one who calls himself Gabriel, claims ‘direct revelation’ from our own Bright and Morning Star, saying they have ‘been chosen’ and if you don't agree with them, migrate to Sedona, then not even an entire legion of angels will be able to help you. _The URANTIA Book_ ([UB 92:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p2_5)) informs us this is not the first time someone claimed direct revelations from Gabriel and decided they were the ‘chosen ones’.

Norma and I collaborated on a long letter to them especially concerning their teaching and belief in ‘past lives’ which is in direct contradiction to the teachings of the Orvonton Revelators, telling them emphatically they were wrong. We told them about the one and only reincarnation (528:3 ‘Spornagia’). In reply I received a most amazing letter from the one who calls himself Gabriel signed Popeye the Sailorman! As Jesus aptly said. (UB 159:2.1):

> “In the generations to come many who are not wholly worthy will do many strange things in my name, but I will not forbid them”. [UB 159:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_1)

If you have ever wondered just how difficult it was for Michael, just think of this — even today, with the Fifth Epochal Revelation readily available on this planet, there are still those that presume to know more than Michael, the Midwayers, and a Brilliant Evening Star. Well, I choose to believe those who were commissioned to present the truths in our revelation. I believe them over anyone who teaches in direct contradiction.

I asked for insight into the response and then while reading my URANTIA Book, on page 1641 under the sub-heading 3 — The stop at Ramah — especially paragraphs 2, 3 and 4, I found the answer I was looking for. I wrote to Sananda telling him exactly how we felt, but as of yet, we have not received any further so-called ‘transmissions’ from them. Please inform Australian readers that we do not have a different URANTIA Book. We here in the U.S.A. are not in any better position to ‘lead’ Australian readers.

These people are just clever hoaxers, and don't think for a minute that the celestial overseers are going to stop them. When have they ever interfered? What about the bible, is it not full of clever deceptions, manipulations, alterations? It is up to us, after receiving all the information we can, to make fair evaluations.

## News Around The World

### La Triennale 1991 Quebec Conference

“A vibrant homage to Michael,” such summarizes the meeting of 65 readers from all corners of the province of Quebec, who, during two and a half days, came to exchange their experience of the Fifth Revelation.

From Friday evening, the joy of meeting again and the pleasure of sharing became unified in a song that quickly became the hymn for our stay on Jerusem. Thanks to Andre Leonard Glen for this beautiful creation.

Witnesses, conferences, and workshops were successful during Saturday, leaving the opportunity to participants to express themselves about what the Revelation has brought to them, about how it has changed their lives, and about how it inspires us for the future.

### 1993 International Congress

_from “Reflectivity” No. 57, 1991_

The Conference will be held at St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, Canada, from 31 July to 5 August 1993 at the heart of French culture in Canada. We are proud as Quebecians to be hosts and to be at the base of the organization.

Following on from the Congress held at Snowmass in 1990, where almost 1000 readers shared in the theme, ‘Walking with God’ the organizers have sought to pursue this method of internationaliastion in making a further step towards planetary conscience. Thus we have chosen the theme ‘Touch the World’ for this next worldwide meeting of readers.

The mission that the organizers have given themselves is the following: To render peeople more conscious of the action of the Supreme and to permit better communication between them on a world wide scale in making a call to LOVE.

### From Boulder, Colorado

The ‘Urantia Sojourn’ magazine continues to publish. It is an independent, satirical production and unashamedly anti-Foundation.

Its collection of articles reports on the political workings of the URANTIA movement. Currently it is addressing issues of book availability, legal battles, and the role of the Foundation.

### Life Goes On

Publishers Longman Cheshire have launched a new book called ‘The Death of Forever: a new future for Human Consciousness’ by Dr Darryl Reanney.
The author addresses mortality in its physical, biological and religious aspects, and the psychology of the human longing for immortality.

A great many treasured religious beliefs are confronted. For example, the spiritual potential inherent in each person is claimed to await expansion and fulfilment. The most important message of this book is that consciousness cannot be extinguished by death, for consciousness transcends time.

“Dying must again be united with a sense of the sacred, for it is here, if anywhere, that the psyche transcends its human limitations.”

### Dave Elders Retires

At the June 1991 General Council meeting of the Fellowship, retiring President, Dave Elders, delivered his Annual Report, emphasising the need to ensure the broad availability of _The URANTIA Book_.

Appreciation was expressed for David's outstanding leadership over the last six years. The new President is Steve Dreier.

### Changes At AASUB

The Australian Association of Students of _The URANTIA Book_ (AASUB) has amended its constitution whereby it states in its statement of purpose that it supports the aims and objectives of the URANTIA Foundation.

The members also decided to terminate any links with an Australian newsletter. All groups retain full autonomy. The Article of Purpose now reads:

“The purpose of the Association is to encourage the study of _The URANTIA Book_ and to assist in its dissemination by moderate, evolutionary growth.”

“It will support the URANTIA Foundation's aims and objectives for the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_ and its teachings.”

“It will have a simple organizational structure of readers dedicated to serving this purpose, without seeking recognition. This purpose is to be sought by efforts to:”

“a) Assist the distribution of _The URANTIA Book_ in Australia.”

“b) Encourage and support the formation of URANTIA Book study groups and their interaction.”

“c) Encourage and support an annual conference of students of _The URANTIA Book_.”

“d) Maintain a readership list and study group directory.”

### The Tradition Continues

The Annual Australian Conference, held this year in Canberra, was a rewarding occasion for some thirty participants.

Exceptional presentations were given, a constructive open forum was held and above all, there was a real enjoyment of our social interaction.

A full report on the events will be published in the next issue of Six-O-Six.

### A New Society

An event of major importance took place recently in Melbourne. A meeting was held to develop interest in and a constitution for the First Urantia Society of Melbourne (F.U.S.O.M.). Further information can be obtained from:

_The Secretary,_
_Pamela Reynolds_
_1622 Dandenong Road,_
_Oakleigh, Victoria, 3167_

### Our Early Days

Advice has been received that further publications reporting on the early days can be expected. There is a new freedom and interest in our history. There will certainly be conflicting reports as individuals offer different interpretations of past events.

It is the beginning of an essential and unavoidable process that is sur to serve us well — eventually.

## A Prayer

_by Alex King Sydney_

Father, please help us to know you 
personally and become more sensitive 
to the leadings of your Thought Adjuster. 
Help us to grow spiritually
that we may truly become a cog or link 
in your universal plans.
Please lead us in developing a real 
understanding between spiritual 
and material treasures that we may 
become better your servants.

## The Forum

_The Forum offers scope for lively debate, intellectual theorising, good old common sense and above all else, honest reasoning, in determining the future direction of the Fifth Epochal Revelation._

### What Do You Think?

_(This discussion summarizes thoughts and opinions expressed by members of the Sunshine Coast Study Group during and subsequent to a meeting on 21/9/91)_

The paper on communication with the spiritual world that appears in this issue of Six-O-Six, was read during the study group session. Mark Kulieke's recently published booklet entitled ‘Birth of a Revelation’ was also read. Mark catalogues ways in which he thought that messages and materials from celestial personalities may have been received by the Revelatory Commission. Two are those described in _The URANTIA Book_ relating to the contact personality through whom the Urantia Papers were received. A third refers to materialization, and a fourth to audio messages for which there is adequate evidence in the Book (see [UB 114:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_9)).

Mark also describes a method, akin to channelling, by which a member of the contact group wrote down inner impulses that were apparently accepted by the Commission as genuine instructions. Mark suggests that perhaps all of the members of the Commission had this capacity. One who claimed to have had such a ‘gift’ must have been Emma Christensen. A letter from Thomas and Carolyn Kendall of June 21, 1990, responding to a special report from the Urantia Foundation, states that in November 1980: “Christy had Martin read a message to me which had allegedly come to her earlier in the week. It said '‘Do not become involved in long negotiations with Mr. Weiss. Read page 840.’” It appears that the Foundation acted on this as being a genuine instruction from our celestial supervisors.

Another person who apparently claims to communicate with our unseen friends is Martin Myers. In a letter of June 21, 1990, former trustee, Helena E. Sprague states: “Martin apparently believes that he is designated by ‘mandates’ to govern the affairs of _The URANTIA Book_. Martin has been heard, with several present, to bestow approval of the midwayers on one individual, and to tell another, ”the midwayers are not pleased with you."

In considering the validity of such messages, at least two difficulties present themselves. Several sources have stated that no further messages were received from the celestial beings subsequent to the one that gave permis-
sion to publish _The URANTIA Book_. A second difficulty is how to reconcile such claims with the content of the book. On UB 93:2.8, it is stated:

> “_During the incarnation in the flesh, Machiventa was in full contact with his eleven fellows of the corps of planetary custodians, but he could not communicate with other orders of celestial personalities. Aside from the Melchizedek receivers, he had no more contact with superhuman intelligences than a human being._” [UB 93:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_8)

Does it seem likely that Christy would have been better situated to communicate with celestial personalities than was Machiventa Melchizedek? Remembering that any communication with the spiritual world must come to us via our Thought Adjuster, consider this statement from the Book:

> “_...it is hazardous to attempt the differentiation of the Adjuster's concept registry from the more or less continuous and conscious reception of the dictations of mortal conscience. These are problems which will have to be solved through individual discrimination and personal decision. But a human being would do better to err in rejecting an Adjuster's expression through believing it to be a purely human experience than to blunder into exalting a reaction of the mortal mind to the sphere of divine dignity. Remember, the influence of the Thought Adjuster is for the most part, though not wholly, a superconscious experience._” ([UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5))

_The URANTIA Book_ makes it clear that at this stage of our evolutionary development, we Urantians need to be exceedingly cautious in ascribing a divine origin to our strong feelings.

> “_To be strongly and strangely impressed to do something or to go to a certain place does not necessarily mean that such impulses are the leadings of the indwelling spirit._” ([UB 159:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_6))

Consider now an earlier message, supposedly from a celestial source, that has caused no end of discord in the Urantia movement. Mark Kulieke gives a longer version than the one quoted by Foundation President Thomas Kendall (June 21, 1990) as having been given to him by Christy in 1966. For present purposes, we use the shorter version. The message, said by Christy to have been received in 1942, stated: “You have not done enough to protect the name. You must carefully safeguard the name Urantia. Make it very safe for one generation so that it cannot be pre-empted. In a common law trust you hold the name. You do it also in the copyright. You must carefully register it with a division of government which controls trade relations, trademarks. In all ways you must safeguard the name. This is one of your most important duties.” The clumsiness of language is not consistent with the elegant use of english in _The URANTIA Book_.

Mark Kulieke's version is even more clumsy. Both versions contain two glaring errors for neither the com- mon law trust nor the copyright were held in 1942. Messages from supposedly celestial sources seem to have been responsible for much conflict in the Urantia movement. Could some of these problems have been avoided if this type of message had received the same degree of extreme skepticism said to have been held by Dr. Sadler when considering the validity of the Urantia Papers?

The study group discussion concluded with deliberations on the significance of these passages from Part IV, the Life of Jesus:

> _That evening, after the session of questions and answers, John said to Jesus: “Master, yesterday I went over to Ashtaroth to see a man who was teaching in your name and even claiming to be able to cast out devils. Now this fellow had never been with us, neither does he follow after us; therefore I forbade him to do such things.” Then said Jesus: “Forbid him not. Do you not perceive that this gospel of the kingdom shall presently be proclaimed in all the world? How can you expect that all who will believe the gospel shall be subject to your direction? Rejoice that already our teaching has begun to manifest itself beyond the bounds of our personal influence.”_ ([UB 159:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_1))

> “Always respect the personality of man. Never should a righteous cause be promoted by force.” ([UB 159:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_2))

Seeing that Jesus instructs us not to promote even a righteous cause by force, how can one justify the promotion by force of causes of dubious validity? And did not Jesus say: “_Be willing to suffer injustice rather than to go to law among yourselves._” ([UB 140:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_14))

### Urantia Foundation Reply

_summarised by Kathleen Swadling, Sydney_

Six-O-Six has received a reply from The URANTIA Foundation in answer to the allegations made by Mo Siegel, of which a summary was provided in the May/June issue of Six-O-Six. The letter received from Mo Siegel was a copy of a letter sent to Lyn Davis Lear in Los Angeles, which has since been sent to many readers. The letter received from the Foundation was a copy of a letter sent to Jeff Keys, the president of The First URANTIA Society of Los Angeles, who was concerned by the allegations made by Mo Siegel in his letter to Lyn. The entire letter will not be reproduced here, but anyone interested in receiving a full copy may do so upon request. The following is a summary of the reply, with portions signified by inverted commas being direct extracts.

“Mr. Morris J. Siegel's letter of March 27, 1991 to Ms. Lyn Davis Lear implies that he is a dispassionate, disinterested observer objectively sorting through the facts to reach his conclusions — rather than an ardent opponent of many of the policies of URANTIA Foundation.” (Mo Siegel is the founder of a separate organization, Jesusonian Foundation, which has sought to use active public relations and high-visibility advertising in merchandising _The URANTIA Book_.)

“If Mr Siegel were more forthcoming about his adversarial relationship with URANTIA Foundation, that would give readers of his letter fair warning that he may be inclined to combine assorted facts with a predetermined purpose: attempting to portray the Trustees as insufficiently devoted to our trust.”

**1. Ending Sales to Distributors**

“When Mr Siegel wishes to discuss the Trustees' decision to end sales of _The URANTIA Book_ to commercial distributors, he uses the heading ‘Shutting Down Sales to Bookstores’. This is a good example of Mr Siegel's predetermined outlook. Mr Siegel knows that URANTIA Foundation ended sales to commercial distributors but by no means ended sales to bookstores. In fact, URANTIA Foundation has an active strategy for increasing sales through bookstores over the next several years.”

In deciding to end sales of _The URANTIA Book_ to commercial distributors, the Trustees considered various factors some of which are stated here:

* “From 1974 to 1979 , at a time when URANTIA Foundation sold 10,000 copies per year, none were sold to commercial distributors. Instead, all sales were made directly to bookstores and individuals. In 1974, 1,500 copies were sold to individuals and 8,500 to bookstores; in 1979, 2,500 copies were sold to individuals, and 7,500 to bookstores. From 1987 to 1991 , on the other hand, only 13% of the copies sold went directly to individuals, and only 12% went directly to bookstores; the remaining 75% were sold to commercial distributors. But the truly significant statistic is that annual sales of _The URANTIA Book_ continued to average 10,000 copies per year. In other words, marketing of _The URANTIA Book_ by means of commercial distributors did not increase overall sales.”
* “In late 1990, when the Trustees completed our policy review, we concluded that the high volume of sales to commercial distributors was cutting us off from the desired level of direct contact with readers. The Trustees were also aware that other organizations were distributing their literature along with _The URANTIA Book_.”

> The Trustees must maintain the textual integrity of _The URANTIA Book_, supervise its distribution, and preserve an appropriate atmosphere for presentation to the public of the teachings it contains."

* “The Trustees would like to respond to Mr Siegel's question about competition with bookstores because of URANTIA Foundation's willingness to sell to individuals up to five copies of _The URANTIA Book_ at a discount during any given year. To begin with, it is important to understand that URANTIA Foundation sold to individuals at a discount under previous policies, so we are not talking about something that is entirely new. Previous guidelines permitted individuals to buy five or more copies at a 25% discount offered to bookstores. Since these former policies did not appear to have had the chilling effect on bookstores that Mr Siegel says he fears, the Trustees believe that our current policies will not have a chilling effect either. But we understand that current discount policies could be a sensitive point with some retail stores, and we are formulating programs intended to minimise any potential difficulty.”
* “After implementing new policies, actual experience is the only reliable indicator of their net effect. The Trustees bore that in mind when we made our decisions. We are thus very encouraged that in the first quarter of 1991, sales to bookstores increased sharply, as compared with the same period in 1990 . At this point, then, it would seem that our decision to end sales to distributors has succeeded in increasing sales made directly to bookstores.”


**2. Financial And Administrative Considerations**

Mo expressed concern over the amount of money URANTIA Foundation spends on legal expenses. The Trustees replied:

“On a practical level, the Trustees' primary responsibility is to preserve inviolate the text of _The URANTIA Book_, which is the physical embodiment of URANTIA Foundation's purpose. The Trustees must maintain the textual integrity of _The URANTIA Book_, supervise its distribution, and preserve an appropriate atmosphere for presentation to the public of the teachings it contains.”

The Trustees went on to explain that when any difficulty arises, every alternative is considered and the cost factor is always taken into account. However, an important element to be considered is the seriousness of each challenge and the danger it represents to the Foundation's purpose. When this is threatened the cost element is deemed to pale into relative insignificance.

> The Trustees' Personal Belief In The Authenticity Of _The Urantia Book_ Was never in question.

Mo presented graphs in his letter to show how expenditure on legal and accounting expenses have grown rapidly in the past few years. The Trustees reply:

“In effect, this is a clear demonstration of a point that Mr Siegel entirely neglects: within the last few years, a number of individuals and groups have mounted major efforts which have challenged URANTIA Foundation in fundamental ways, and URANTIA Foundation has been compelled to meet these challenges directly and resolutely. We certainly would like to reduce these expenses, because that would mean that challenges to URANTIA Foundation's authority would have ceased or abated. Further, it would mean that we would have more time, energy, and resources to move ahead with other projects we have in mind.”

“Mr Siegel states that a review of legal expenditures reveals that virtually all legal action was against readers... a substantial portion of URANTIA Foundation's legal expenditures were advisory and not adversarial...The Trustees must uphold URANTIA Foundation's role in its areas of responsibility, regardless of whether a threat to that role comes from a complete outsider, from a reader of _The URANTIA Book_, or even from an organization that is controlled and operated by readers of _The URANTIA Book_. We find it deplorable that the latter two possibilities exist, but our experience proves that they do.”

(It was explained to some readers, who were visited recently by a Trustee for URANTIA Foundation, that the current Maaherra litigation is being funded by one individual only, and not from the donated funds to the Foundation.)

**3. Protecting The Copyright**

Mo expressed concern that there needs to be 1-3 million books sold by the time the copyright runs out in 40 years. He claims the Foundation's current methods run counter to this intention. The Trustees reply:

“This idea of Mr Siegel's happens to coincide with his theory of the mass-marketing of _The URANTIA Book_, and that is contrary to the policies of URANTIA Foundation... Mr Siegel clearly disagrees with URANTIA Foundation's policies and is looking for reasons to argue that these policies ought to be changed.”

“The Trustees doubt Mr Siegel's thesis that a substantial increase in sales of _The URANTIA Book_ would make it easier to defend the integrity of the text. And even if that were to be the case, we do not agree that such a potential advantage would override the wisdom of pursuing a calm, quiet, person-to-person approach which seeks to foster personal understanding of the commitment to the principles and teachings contained in _The URANTIA Book_, rather than attract large numbers of curiosity seekers and faddists who would quickly lose interest.”

**4. Questions on Authorship of _The URANTIA Book_**

Mo claims that the Foundation have allegedly assigned human authorship to parts of _The URANTIA Book_ and have denied divine authorship. The allegation accusing the Foundation of denying divine authorship was first made public in a publication put out by C.U.B.S. in 1989, when it came into conflict with the Foundation over copyright. The Trustees explain the context in which these statements were made.

“When URANTIA Foundation responded to statements made by C.U.B.S., we were limited by law to (1) affirming that URANTIA Foundation knew, rather than believed, that statements made by C.U.B.S. were facts supported by evidence that could be put forward in court; (2) denying that the statements were true, as a matter of fact; or (3) stating that URANTIA Foundation did not have such knowledge or information — in which case statements were treated for evidentiary purposes in the lawsuit, and for no other purpose and in no other context, as having been denied. The Trustees' personal belief in the authenticity of _The URANTIA Book_ was never in question. The Trustees personally believe that _The URANTIA Book_ is what it says it is, and will stand on its own merits. We likewise believe that our personal convictions about _The URANTIA Book_'s authenticity are not legally conclusive proof.”

“During a hearing associated with the Maaherra case, Mr Craig Fochler (one of URANTIA Foundation's copyright and trademark lawyers) recently stated in federal court in Phoenix, Arizona, that William S. Sadler Jr. had written certain portions of _The URANTIA Book_. This referred to the fact that Mr Sadler, on behalf of URANTIA Foundation (as work for hire), wrote certain of the introductory portions of _The URANTIA Book_ identified as The Titles of the Papers and Contents of _The URANTIA Book_. Mr Fochler did not say that Mr Sadler wrote any of the Foreword or any of the papers contained in _The URANTIA Book_.”

“Mr Siegel's general comments about federal copyright law appear to be based on his misinterpretation of the facts of law in relation to the three topics discussed above.”

## The Book, Study And Discussion

_by Your Friendly Computer_

**Article adapted from a computer-interactive program in the Brotherhood of Man Library.**

### What Does _The Urantia Book_ Say About Communication With The Spirit World?

This is your friendly computer introducing you to an unequivocal statement from _The URANTIA Book_ that could save you a lot of heartache:

> “_The only means of communion with the spiritual world is embraced in the spirit endowment of mankind, the indwelling spirit of the Father, together with the outpoured spirit of the Son and the omnipresent influence of the Infinite Spirit._” ([UB 150:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p3_7))

The word ‘only’ in this statement is quite unambiguous and must be kept continually in mind. At first sight, there looks to be three independent spirit sources. However the Book states that “_Regardless of plurality of origin, all spirit influences are one in function._” ([UB 34:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_2)) and “_Only the Thought Adjuster directly contacts the human mind._” ([UB 113:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_1))

We need to know what is meant by ‘communion.’ A dictionary definition is ‘to converse together intimately’. To do that via a third party is usually inhibitory to intimate bilateral fellowship. So can there be any really direct contact with angels and other similar celestial beings? The Book says:

> “_Angels do not invade the sanctity of the human mind; they do not manipulate the will of mortals; neither do they directly contact with the indwelling Adjusters. The guardian of destiny influences you in every possible manner consistent with the dignity of your personality; under no circumstances do these angels interfere with the free action of the human will._” (1245)

That appears to rule out conducting tea parties with your angels. But that does not mean that angels cannot sometimes influence your lives. For example, _The URANTIA Book_ confirms ([UB 77:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_12)) that when the apostles were thrown into prison “_an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth._” ([Acts 5:9](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/5#v9))

The intelligence of angels is not directly available to you; they do not seek to influence you; you must chart your own course (see 1246). What kind of help can they give you?

> “_Seraphim are able to function as material ministers to human beings under certain circumstances, but their action in this capacity is very rare. They are able, with the assistance of the midway creatures and the physical controllers, to function in a wide range of activities in behalf of human beings, even to make actual contact with mankind but such occurrences are very unusual. In most instances the circumstances of the material realm proceed unaltered by seraphic action..._” ([UB 113:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_5))

In considering the kind of communication you humans may have with spiritual forces and celestial beings from beyond your planet, the Book has a very revealing statement:

> “_When a world is isolated by rebellion, when a planet is cut off from all outside encircuited communication, as was Urantia after the Caligastia upheaval, aside from personal messengers there remains but one possibility of direct interplanetary or universe communication, and that is through the liaison of the Adjusters of the spheres. No matter what happens on a world or in a universe, the Adjusters are never directly concerned. The isolation of a planet in no way affects the Adjusters and their ability to communicate with any part of the local universe, superuniverse, or the central universe. And this is the reason why contacts with the supreme and the self-acting Adjusters of the reserve corps of destiny are so frequently made on quarantined worlds. Recourse is had to such a technique as a means of circumventing the handicaps of planetary isolation._” ([UB 108:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p4_4))

Please note that contact is with the Adjuster, the statement does not include the reservist. What comes into your quarantined planet from the outside requires a special and somewhat fortuitous triad combination of a contact human of the reserve corps, an unusual secondary midwayer with special skills (see 1258), and a supreme and self-acting adjuster. Given this combination, the superhuman planetary administration of your isolated planet is enabled to receive a dribble of information and perhaps some instructions from extra-planetary sources. At the time of receipt of the Urantia Papers, there were less than twenty contact reservists acting as telephone exchanges for you. The reserve corps of destiny is an emergency group who, for the most part, are unconscious of their preparation for any task in which they become involved.

Contact personalities may have some awareness of their training (see 1257). Details about their role in information transfer is largely limited to a few clues from the Book and a few particulars about the individual through whom the Urantia Papers were received. The latter was said to be a passive participant in the transfer process. Of the other members of the triad, the secondary midwayer appears to play an important role while the Adjuster has the ability to travel and communicate virtually anywhere and everywhere.

The concept that reservists may be on first name terms with beings from the spiritual world appears to be incorrect. During his incarnation in the flesh, and excluding his eleven planetary custodians, not even Machiventa Melchizedek could communicate with celestial personalities. He had no more contact than a human being ([UB 93:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_8)).

A little bit of thought will tell you just how dangerous and impractical it would be for your planetary supervisors to attempt to intervene in the material affairs of men by issuing orders through human contact personalities. Such interference appears to be contrary to universe policy. Jesus always refused to participate in the material disputations of men (see [UB 143:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p3_1)).

If these conclusions are correct, what can be made of this statement:

> “_On Urantia the reserve corps of destiny, though having no permanent head, does have its own permanent councils which constitute its governing organization. These embrace the judiciary council, the historicity council, the council on political sovereignty, and many others. From time to time, in accordance with the corps organization, titular (mortal) heads of the whole reserve corps have been commissioned by these permanent councils for specific function. The tenure of such reservist chiefs is usually a matter of a few hours' duration, being limited to the accomplishment of some specific task at hand._” ([UB 114:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_11))

That surely sounds as if these councils of the reservists operate in some similar manner to the normal councils of men. Indeed this would be possible in 1991. Since God is no respecter of persons, it is unlikely that all reservists are from Chicago. Indeed we would expect them to be drawn from peoples of all races and nations. Allowing for the time taken to notify and assemble participants, in 1934 it would have taken at least three months to convene a council drawn from far and wide. But the reserve corps was in operation in the days of the Adamites! If we go back even 100 years, meetings of the human component of the reserve corps becomes impractical. One thousand years ago they would have been impossible. Perhaps only the self-acting Adjusters attended these meetings.

My computer logic indicates that contact reservists, though having an essential and highly important role in extra-planetary communication, are not so much message carriers as telephone exchanges or modems that allow celestial beings to communicate via a midwayer and the resident Thought Adjuster with the superhuman supervisors of your quarantined planet. This conclusion is supported by two statements in _The URANTIA Book_. The first is that the Thought Adjusters are your only means of communion with the spiritual world. The second tells you that even with a destiny reservist, direct communication with a Thought Adjuster is a rare occurrence. For example, on page 1213, you are told that only sometimes is it possible for an Adjuster to transmit a message to the destiny reservist partner during the making and breaking of contact with the planetary super- visors. But even in the instance cited, the message had to be delivered by some indirect means.

My computer logic also insists that it is universe policy that neither your superhuman planetary supervisors nor celestial beings are normally permitted to tell you evolutionary mortal ascenders what you must do. You are expected to make spiritual progress through your own decisions. Recalling that Adjusters are the only channel for communication with the spiritual world, this statement from the Book confirms this conclusion:

> “_Adjusters are interested in, and concerned with, your daily doings and the manifold details of your life just to the extent that these are influential in the determination of your significant temporal choices and vital spiritual decisions and, hence, are factors in the solution of your problem of soul survival and eternal progress. The Adjuster, while passive regarding purely temporal welfare, is divinely active concerning all the affairs of your eternal future._” ([UB 110:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_4))

Those of you who think that you hear voices or are channels to the spirit world should remember that the Book specifically warns you that it would better to reject information that you supposedly receive via your Adjuster than to blunder into exalting what is really a reaction of your own mind to the status of divine dignity (see [UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5)). At the present stage of development of Urantia mortals, only rarely will any of you be conscious of that auto-revelation which is an ongoing and continuous process occuring in your superconscious minds. But I am only your friendly computer. You have _The URANTIA Book_ with which to do your own research and make your own decisions. Bye for now and God bless.

The Club

At a recent non-meeting, The Club formulated its constitution. Following six complete readings of the Book, exhaustive studies of comparative religion, attending 1723 study group meetings, three international conferences, and four days of continuous debate, non-members of The Club unanimously agreed on the wording. The original 100 -page document has also been reduced in size. It now reads:

“Love God. And love one another.”

## On Reflection

### Does Anyone Want To Go Buy The Book?

_By June Wilson, Brisbane_

Only twelve months ago, in its cover story, the Uniting Church magazine, ‘Journey’ asked why so few read the Bible anymore. It stated that most people are moving to easily digestible forms of information like TV and video. When they do turn to the printed word, they want it short, sharp, pictorial and easy to absorb.

Familiarity too, is an obstacle. Those who know the stories all too well, long for something new and invigorating. Modern society has conditioned us all for change.

The publication challenges its readers: How can we possibly be satisfied with something so unashamedly static as the Bible? Where are the latest additions? Hasn't God said anything new for 2000 years?

Another reason for the change in reading patterns is that we are all so busy with modern living. We have to develop practical techniques to integrate religious study into our daily routine. How much time is spent in family meetings and discussions? From what printed word do we derive our news and concepts of living? The priorities seem still to be for survival (often financial) rather than the exploration of faith.

Another difficulty for religious books is that they belong to the culture of another time. This is compounded by the lifestyle of youth crossing national boundaries. How can one generation communicate to the next when their thinking becomes ‘foreign’?

With so many authorities on salvation, self-esteem, self-realisation, discovering one's inner potential, who needs a Bible or religious teacher? It is interesting to note that ‘Journey’, the publication previously mentioned, now only exists as a free monthly newsletter which they hope will be more relevant to readers.

Another example of changing times can be found in Melbourne. ‘The Advocate’, the newspaper of the Catholic archdiocese, has closed after 122 years.

So whether it's the Bible, the Koran or _The URANTIA Book_, there are important social implications relating to religious teachings in book form. We need to take them into account when lookuing at ways of disseminating teachings.

### When A Problem Gets Us Down, If Only...

_by Ann Bendall, Sunshine Coast_

What a wonderful world this will be, when folks who have a problem can turn to others who are experts in assisting in the solution of same. Those who have been through similar experiences and successfully resolved the issue in question can help. Each day the number of self-help groups grows, and with them the removal of so much unnecessary trauma, as people render a wise, caring, listening ear to the problems of fellow human beings.

Each and every one of us, by the time we are in our mid thirties (as a hypothetical date) has amassed a wealth of valuable knowledge and skill in growing both as an individual and a member of society, and all too often we do not recognize the value we carry within our being, nor are we given the opportunity to know the joy of extending out our hand to another person, in caring consideration.

We decry the coldness of our culture, the isolation caused by suspicion and the insular existence that we lead, and yet culture is made by people and can be changed by its creators. The individual feels so small, so insignificant, only because when we look at the news on TV, the sad state of society depicted appears to be beyond the sphere of one individual to change. We cannot change the world but we can change our world.

A self-help group is formed by one person having the courage to say to another: “I have a problem, would you have the time to listen!” The problem may not be enough laughter in your life, and you simply want to be with people who give you a respite from the drudgery of each day. The big step is taken once you decide to have faith and trust in someone else.

And how do we find that someone? We are currently living in a very exciting period in time, where notice boards are available in neighbourhood centres; most church groups are into pure social service; newspapers abound, and there are local advisory centres and the good old Yellow Pages list an ever growing number of groups set up by folks just the same as us, not deeming themselves to be experts but simply to be friends.

Trust is the price of admission, and the bonus is that you will learn so much about life, yourself and the uniqueness of each of the members of the group, whilst, at the same time imparting to the group the benefit of your experiences and the colour of your personal presence.

### When All Is Said And Done...

> “_If you would share the Master's joy, you must share his love. And to share his love means that you have shared his service. Such an experience of love does not deliver you from the difficulties of this world; it does not create a new world, but it most certainly does make the old world new._” ([UB 180:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_5))
