## Editor's Notebook

### 97,98,99 ...

Welcome to our first issue for 1992, our thirteenth year of publication ... and ... the ninety-ninth issue of Six-O-Six.

Now is the opportunity to put pen to paper and send your pearls of wisdom, good wishes, or general comments, for our next very special edition — number one hundred.

We would like to present a selection of reader responses from around the world. So let's hear from you and be a part of our history and our celebration.

### Our Challenge

Information exchange and technology continues to set political, social, and industry agendas, interconnecting our global village.

Major political ideologies and new trading blocs are being synthesized into social development.

The irony is that the forces inherent in change from information are not under the direct control of any political or business leaders.

Our pursuit of knowledge reflects on our culture, the philosophies of scientists, and creativity in art, music and literature.

Into this context, _The URANTIA Book_ must take its place. The more effectively and professionally it can be presented, the more concilliatory will be its public perception.

Individuals and URANTIA Book organizations will continue through 1992 to address the challenge of how best to allocate resources so that modern technology can enhance the scope of opportunities for people to become aware of the book and its teachings.

### Crossroads?

How optimistic dare we be for the future of the URANTIA Brotherhood Association?

While it will receive widespread and independent advice on its role and structure, the proof will be in its implementation and administration. We have to be optimistic. What other opportunity for progress looms on the horizon?

While progress may take time, all eyes will be focused on the early initiatives of this organization and the relationship the URANTIA Foundation may choose to impose upon it. Does the Foundation realize the support it will receive for creating a fair and representative association? Does the Foundation understand the urgency for such an association? Does the Foundation see that, if they fail to win the court case, such an organization will be more important than ever?

## So They Say

**Now Sclentist**

Pressure is growing for international safety standards for nuclear reactors. Such a move would make the expansion of nuclear power more acceptable politically and to the public. It would also make it easier to license new designs of reactor.

**World Review**

Recourse to the United Nations is usually a final attempt to manage a problem that individual governments have found insoluble. The growing majority of non-Western countries tend to use the UN as a platform for the advocacy of causes instead of as a forum for negotiating compromises and promotion of solutions.

**Time Magazine**

The Eclipse — July 11, 1991

Studies showed that the sun is bigger than previously thought. Looking at invisible wavelengths that represent hydrogen emissions, the sun's chromosphere, or lower atmosphere, extends 6000 ~km beyond what is normally visible. Measurements suggested that the atmosphere is hotter and denser than had been thought.

**21 — C Magazine**

We are moving rapidly from an industrial era in which material values of growth, status, and production were dominant, into an era where people's psychological and spiritual growth will become more important.

## Letters To The Editor

### International Conference 1993

_By William Wentworth Area Co-Ordinator — Australia_

Preliminary information about The Fellowship for Readers of _The URANTIA Book_ 1993 International Conference is now becoming available. The Conference will be held from the 31st July to 5th August in St. Hyacinthe, Quebec, near Montreal, Canada.

The Conference theme is to be “Touch the World”, and it appears as if there will be a strong emphasis on outreach. As St. Hyacinthe is in the French-speaking part of Canada, the conference will be fully bi-lingual, Canadians being very experienced in this type of function.

The Fellowship is the successor to the Fifth Epochal Fellowship which grew out of the URANTIA Brotherhood following its split from the URANTIA Foundation. It is far and away the largest organization of URANTIA Book readers in the world, and includes 18 of the 21 former URANTIA Brotherhood Societies which had been affiliated with the URANTIA Brotherhood. This organization, under its successive names, holds an international conference every three years, the last one in Colorado in 1990 attracting over one thousand readers to a superbly organized program of information sharing, specialist presentations, socializing and entertainment. The 1993 Conference is the first of these triennial conferences to be held outside the U.S.A., and it will therefore be an important milestone in the Fellowship's progress.

The Canadian organizers are very enthusiastic, and are sure to produce a memorable program. All readers are welcome, so note the date and start saving! For further information contact:

Conference Chairman, Brent St. Denis

### Scientific Unity

_By David Cook, Jan Juc, Victoria_

There are many cultures and their associated religious teachings. If truth is discernible, should not their extra-dimensional science, if they have any, be taken seriously also? For example, the knowledge that there are seven heavens all about the globe we call Earth or Urantia, is widespread among the seers of history.

## News Around The World

### Tenth Printing Completed

The tenth printing of _The URANTIA Book_, consisting of 25,000 copies, brought the total number of books in print since 1955 , to 235,000 .

_Le Livre d'URANTIA_ has completed its fifth printing with a print run of 6,000 copies.

Dust jacket designs for each have been altered to include a wider range of book references.

### Price Increase Inevitable

The URANTIA Foundation, after a decade of maintaining the price of _The URANTIA Book_, is now reviewing its pricing policy and a price rise is inevitable.

Even with a reasonable increase it would still be considerably less expensive than publications of similar size and quality.

### Thick With Lawyers!

Brisbane Sunday Mail, December 8, 1991

The U.S., with 5 percent of the world's population, has 70 percent of the world's lawyers.

That means that American lawyers, just to stay in business, must expand their fields of operations to cover previously benign activities.

So, will Congress step in to halt this madness? No way. 42 percent of the House of Representitives and 62 percent of the Senators are lawyers.

### Advisory Committee Appointed

The Trustees will confer with readers in a more definite way to plan for the future. Seven readers are members of an Advisory Committee to the Trustees (ACT) for the Friends of the URANTIA Foundation and the URANTIA Brotherhood Association.

ACT will primarily serve as a sounding board and a resource on ideas on how to proceed in a practical way with the efforts of Friends of URANTIA Foundation and the implementation of URANTIA Brotherhood Association. ACT will function in an advisory capacity to the trustees for all of 1992 , and have its own operating methods.

The advisory body is not meant to be a political body. To insulate them from political pressure, ACT members will preserve the confidentiality of their deliberations and communications with the Trustees, but they will develop and pass along to them any helpful ideas they may receive from others.

The presentation of _The URANTIA Book_ is an evolutionary process and human wisdom must evolve. It is expected the members of ACT will bring a tested experience which will further the social and fraternal aspects of efforts to disseminate the teachings.

### Calling All Truthists!

Dave Strang is interested in hearing from people who may wish to receive his publication, Now Highlights for Truthists.

In particular, he would like greater contact with readers in New Zealand and Australia.

For further information, write to Dave at: 

_The Jesusonian's Study Group Fellowship,_
_2326 Hecker Av., Rockford, Il. 61103, U.S.A._

### Correct Posture

Book reader, Carl Sarelius, considers proper body posture is very important during meditation. As a result he designed and built a meditation stool for which a patent is pending.

Anyone wanting further information can write to SixO$-Six and we will forward your request on to Carl.

## Articles

### Is Copyright Really Necessary?

_by The Sunshine Coast Study Group_

That _The URANTIA Book_ is still being offered in its virtually original form, we give thanks to the URANTIA Foundation. But times change and we are forced to ask:

**1. Can a person really own a divine revelation?**

Common sense says that the answer to that question is no. Certainly the first four epochal revelations belonged to mankind as a whole. Is it likely that our celestial supervisors would order that the Fifth Epochal Revelation should be owned by a self-nominated, self-perpetuating board of trustees? The book states:

> “Pentecost marked the end of special priesthoods and all belief in sacred families.” ([UB 194:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_15))

_The URANTIA Book_ also states:

> “_No revealed religion can spread to all the world when it makes the serious mistake of becoming permeated with some national culture or associated with established racial, social, or economic practices._” ([UB 194:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_9))

Copyrighting and taking out trade marks, are these not social and economic practices? And how does enforcing the will of the Foundation upon URANTIA Book readers by means of the law courts stack up against the content of our revelation:

> “_Be willing to suffer injustice rather than to go to law among yourselves._” ([UB 140:3.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_14))

**2. Is it likely that our celestial supervisors would grant authority to the Foundation Trustees to assert control over the utilization of the Fifth Epochal Revelation?**

Even with our limited wisdom and vision, we mortals are unlikely to have considered granting such authority to a self-nominated, self-perpetuating board of trustees. The very content of _The URANTIA Book_ is such that we find it inconceivable that our celestial revelators would have done so.

> “_Pentecost was designed to lessen the self-assertiveness of individuals, groups, nations, races._” ([UB 194:3.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p3_18))

To the apostle, Philip, Jesus said:

> “_There is but one law to obey — that is the command to go forth proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom. Cease to fear men; be unafraid to preach the good news of eternal life to your fellows who languish in darkness and hunger for the light of truth._” ([UB 192:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_11))

Can you imagine Jesus telling an apostle that, if they should write an article for one of their congregations, they must only quote 500 words from his gospel, else they would infringe copyright? And be subject to legal action!
A man named Aden was teaching in Jesus' name in the village of Ashtaroth. The apostle John did not like it, so he forbade the man to do so. On relating this to Jesus, the Master said:

> “_Forbid him not. Do you not perceive that this gospel of the kingdom shall presently be proclaimed in all the world? How can you expect that all who will believe the gospel shall be subject to your direction?_” ([UB 159:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_1))

Aden was not taken to court. In fact he raised up a considerable company of believers at Kanata before going on to Mesopotamia ([UB 159:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p2_4)).

**3. What are the likely consequences of loss of copyright of _The URANTIA Book_?**

The URANTIA Foundation was set up as a nonprofit organization. We see its main task as being to keep the original plates (or authenticated copies thereof) intact so that inviolate copies of the original text will always be available. That is its most important function. Irrespective of the fate of the copyright, the Foundation's vital role will remain unaltered — that is to keep in print an unabridged original text.

Some say we must protect the book. Protect it from what? This divine revelation is safe, it has no need of human defenders. What if another publisher chose to print and distribute the book? Perhaps the text would be altered! There are many publishers of the Bible. All aim to sell as many copies as possible. So they want the most authentic text that they can get. This opinion was put forward strongly by French readers at the 2nd International Conference near Paris in 1989. Many French readers eagerly await their new translation because they believe it will be more authentic than the Weiss translation, which, with 7 out of 10 for merit, has already served them well.

> “Be Willing To Suffer Injustice Rather Than To Go To Law Among Yourselves.” (UB 140:3.14)

Some may say that perhaps the book would be published in comic book form. If it is done well, many may get the message of the gospel of the kingdom who would otherwise have missed out. Some of these would eventually want the real thing. And if it is done badly, it wont sell. An illustrated book is another possibility. If that is done well, then it too will introduce new readers. Eventually the serious ones will want the real thing.

The sale of _The URANTIA Book_ is not the number one priority. The number of people who receive and accept the true gospel of the kingdom from any source whatsoever, that is what is important. And if that happens, then the following exhortation from the book itself will be fulfilled:

> “_The religious challenge of this age is to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness._” ([UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10))

> This divine revelation is safe, it has no need of human defenders.

A Divine Counselor wrote those words. For URANTIA Book devotees, the book itself is the only possible reference source of “the enlarged and exquisitely modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty and divine goodness”. New and appealing philosophies are to be constructed from it. That means secondary works. One well-known Foundation trustee of long standing has been reported to have stated that secondary works are not necessary. _The URANTIA Book_ says otherwise. So if they come in the form of children's picture books, comic books, illustrated URANTIA Books, videos or multimedia presentations, and these bring the gospel of the kingdom to the peoples of Urantia, then God's will shall have been done.

**4. Is the first obligation of URANTIA Book readers to the URANTIA Foundation or to God?**

That is scarcely a necessary question. But if you are helping a person or a group to understand the book, and it is essential to quote more than the 500 words from the book, as recommended by the Foundation, do you deny them that help, telling them to wait while you see if you can obtain permission? And if you feel that a blind friend would greatly benefit if you used a computer program to transcribe URANTIA Book text into Braille would you deny that benefit to your friend because of fear of the Foundation (it has already threatened prosecution for such an ‘offence’).

**5. Is the current situation real or have we, like Alice, stepped through the looking glass? It is difficult to say. Conclusions:**

> “_The Father in heaven loves his children, and therefore should you lean to love one another; the Father in heaven forgives you your sins; therefore should you learn to forgive one another. If your brother sins against you, go to him and with tact and patience show him his fault. And do all this between you and him alone. If he will listen to you, then have you won your brother. But if your brother will not hear you, if he persists in the error of his way, go again to him, taking with you one or two mutual friends that you may thus have two or even three witnesses to confirm your testimony and establish the fact that you have dealt justly and mercifully with your offending brother. Now if he refuses to hear your brethren, you may tell the whole story to the congregation, and then, if he refuses to hear the brotherhood, let them take such action as they deem wise._” ([UB 159:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p1_3))

> “_You well know the commandment which directs that you love one another; that you love your neighbor even as yourself. But I am not wholly satisfied with even that sincere devotion on the part of my children. I would have you perform still greater acts of love in the kingdom of the believing brotherhood. And so I give you this new commandment: That you love one another even as I have loved you. And by this will all men know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another._” ([UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1))

How can we pretend to be believers in and witnesses to the Fifth Epochal Revelation in the light of the shameful behavior that has been evident from all levels of the URANTIA movement these last several years? How can personal and slanderous attacks of individuals upon one another be justified? How can we excuse or justify litigation in the law courts against individual brothers and sisters with no semblance of an attempt at communication or reconciliation first having been made?

> “_Jesus loved men so much because he placed such a high value on them. You can best discover values in your associates by discovering their motivation. If someone irritates you, causes feelings of resentment, you should sympathetically seek to discern his viewpoint, his reasons for such objectionable conduct. If once you understand your brother, you will become tolerant, and this tolerance will grow into friendship and ripen into love._” ([UB 100:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_4))

Is this not a command that we, too, must place a high value on our brothers and sisters?

Many of the recent deviations from the legitimate pathway of loving service have come about because of the existence of the means for one group to control all others -the privileges conferred by copyright and registered trade marks.

What would happen if these powers were revoked? Whatever happens could hardly be worse than what is now happening, behavior that exhibits not the faintest sign of the brotherly and sisterly love that the Master expects from us. In a post-resurrection appearance he said:

> “_You are all to proclaim this gospel of love and truth by the lives which you live in the flesh. You shall love one another with a new and starting affection, even as I have loved you. And when men see that you so love them, and when they behold how fervently you serve them, they will perceive that you have become faith fellows of the kingdom of heaven and they will follow after the Spirit of Truth which they see in your lives._” ([UB 191:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p6_2))

Are we going to fail our Master, or are we prepared to try again to tread the true pathway to brotherly love?

### To Make Fair Evaluations

_by Madeline Noordzy, Perth_

The last four words in Connie Lester's letter to the September/October 1991 issue of Six-O-Six, “...to make fair evaluations.” prompted me to study _The URANTIA Book_ a little more in regards to the claims made by Gabriel of Sedona as to ‘repersonalizations.’ says:

On UB 114:7.13 a mysterious paragraph in brackets

> “_(The cosmic reserve corps of universe-conscious citizens on Urantia now numbers over one thousand mortals whose insight of cosmic citizenship far transcends the sphere of their terrestrial abode, but I am forbidden to reveal the real nature of the function of this unique group of living human beings.)_” [UB 114:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_13)

On UB 55:3.11, _The URANTIA Book_ tells us:

“_When a settled world progresses beyond the third stage of light and life, all ascenders are destined, before attaining the minor sector, to receive some sort of transient assignment on a planet passing through the earlier stages of evolution._” [UB 55:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p3_11)

I am asking myself now whether this cosmic reserve corps are ascenders from other worlds who are on a “transient assignment” here on Urantia because they put their hands up when volunteers were needed to help advance this backward planet during this renaissance of spiritual awakening. They would not be ‘chosen ones’, they volunteered. There is a difference!

Sananda's claim that Machiventa appears through his light body does not seem so strange to me when I read on UB 50:2.7:

> “_...the Melchizedeks can and do make themselves visible to the inhabitants of the evolutionary worlds._” [UB 50:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_7)

Especially it does not seem strange when on UB 93:10.6, I read:

> “_Recent rulings handed down from the Most Highs of Edentia, and later confirmed by the Ancients of Days of Uversa, strongly suggest that this bestowal Melchizedek is destined to take the place of the fallen Planetary Prince, Caligastia. If our conjectures in this respect are correct, it is altogether possible that Machiventa Melchizedek may again appear in person on Urantia and in some modified manner resume the role of the dethroned Planetary Prince, or else appear on earth to function as vicegerent Planetary Prince representing Christ Michael, who now actually holds the title of Planetary Prince of Urantia. While it is farfrom clear to us as to what Machiventa's destinymaybe, nevertheless, events which have so recently taken place strongly suggest that the foregoing conjectures are probably not far from the truth._” [UB 93:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p10_6)

On UB 114:1.4, The Chief of Seraphim stationed on Urantia, writes:

> “Still others, including this narrator, look for Melchizedek's appearance any day or hour.” [UB 114:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p1_4)

This was of course written in the first half of this century.

The people of Sedona claim that this has in fact happened.

In Paper 50 on “The Planetary Princes”, the book mentions on UB 50:2.4:

> “_The entire staff of a world ruler consists of personalities of the Infinite Spinit and certain types of higher evolved beings and ascending mortals from other worlds (emphasis mine). Such a staff averages about one thousand, and as the planet progresses, this corps of helpers may be increased up to one hundred thousand or more._” [UB 50:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p2_4)

Urantia being the unique planet it is, could this be the cosmic reserve corps of destiny?

On UB 50:4.9 we are being told:

> “_A Planetary Prince is not visible to mortal beings: it is a test of faith (emphasis mine) to believe the representations of the semimaterial beings of his staff._” [UB 50:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p4_9)

On UB 50:7.1, when speaking of agondonters, the book says:

> “_We have discovered that such ascenders are very early intrusted with numerous special assignments to cosmic undertakings (emphasis mine) where unquestioned faith and sublime confidence are essential to achievement._” [UB 50:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/50#p7_1)

Is it not possible that Sananda, White Cloud, Gabriel and Niann have had previous experiences as agondonters on special assignments?

Could it not be that Gabriel of Sedona is the material complement of Gabriel of Salvington when _The URANTIA Book_, when discussing self-acting adjusters, tells us that

> “_a self-acting Adjuster is one who has served in a time of crisis in the expereince of some human being who was the material complement (emphasis mine) of a spirit personality intrusted with the enactment of some cosmic achievement essential to the spiritual economy of the planet._” ([UB 109:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_7))

I feel it is important not to become too dogmatic about _The URANTIA Book_ and perhaps have a look at this ‘repersonalization’ from another angle.

Jesus always taught us that love is the key to everything and when looking for the motives of someone else's behaviour, not first to look for the worst one, that of material gain and self-aggrandizement, but trust that the God within that person is guiding him or her to give service — and maybe a very high one — to his or her fellow. men.

When all is said and done, how many of us have really checked this out for ourselves? Has Connie ever met these people in Sedona?

Somebody once wrote:

“What would happen, If everybody said, ‘What would happen?’ And nobody went, To take a look, At what would happen, If something happened.”

To the people who prefer to watch on the cosmic fence and say “What if?”, _The URANTIA Book_ has this to say:

> “_Universe difficulties must be met and planetary obstacles must be encountered as a part of the experience training provided for the growth and development, the progressive perfection, of the evolving souls of mortal creatures. The spiritualization of the human soul requires intimate experience with the educational solving of a wide range of real universe problems. The animal nature and the lower forms of will creatures do not progress favorably in environmental ease. Problematic situations, coupled with exertion stimuli, conspire to produce those activities of mind, soul, and spirit which contribute mightily to the achievement of worthy goals of mortal progression and to the attainment of higher levels of spirit destiny._” ([UB 154:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/154#p2_5))

If there are over one thousand in the cosmic reserve corps, I wonder if most of them have a bit of trouble waking up and remembering why they are here at this time.

> Jesus Always Taught Us That Love Is The Key To Everything...

After reading Transmission S, the title of which is “Delusion Energy Frequencies, Distortion Waves and Distortion Sound Waves in Relationship to the Adjudication of Urantia, Implemented by Machiventa Melchizedek, present Planetary Prince of Urantia” and another communication called “Concerning Earth Changes”, which were recently sent to me from Sedona and which sound like a warning from Machiventa himself to the sometimes smug Urantia movement, it seems to me that the earth changes described are self-evident. We can see them happening all around us, not only in the planet, but to its inhabitants as well. But most people do not know the real reason behind it all.

Schopenhauer once wrote:

“Before a problem achieves recognition as a such it has to go through three stages. In the first one it is laughed at, during the second it will be fought against until, in the third, it is accepted as being self evident.”

I feel we are entering the third stage.

### The Parable Of The Sower

_By Dave Cook, Jan Juc, Victoria_

Imagine you are one of the people on the shore listening to Jesus of whom you have heard favourable reports. He is sitting in the boat speaking words of life. You are seeking truth. You are not there out of idle curiosity with nothing better to do, nor are you there to contend with him as some obviously are.

You hear the first words of a parable he has begun to speak in answer to someone's dejected plea about the woes of life.

“Imagine a sower going out to sow.” You have yourself done much sowing, being as you are, a farmer. You listen on. You see the footpath and the pigeons feeding on the grain that has spilt there. You warm to the story thus far told, for it is a familiar picture, part of everyday life with its ups and downs, its hardship and its humour, good times and bad. You do not begrudge the birds getting their fill on grain that would otherwise be trodden under foot to rot. You listen on.

“...patches of rock..." Ah, yes, those rocks in your field. But you cannot spend all your time clearing away rocks — there are so many of them! So you sow and compromise the ideal of a rock-free paddock with the practicality of survival. You see that the man in the boat is sympathetic because of the warmth with which he portrays you to yourself. You listen on.

“...thorns...”

“Yes, yes”, you nod to yourself, “just like the rocks. Alas, a perfect paddock is a fools's dream.”

“...rich soil and produced their crop, some thirtyfold, some sixtyfold, and some a hundredfold.”

“Yes”, you say somewhat dejectedly, but then correcting yourself, “yes, though much seed did not grow due to the imperfections of things, yet was my toil fruitful in the end.”

Then this man in the boat, this man whom some have hailed as the Messiah, simply concludes his little story with: “Listen anyone who has ears.”

“Yes, I hear you”, thinks the farmer, “though things are imperfect, yet does my toil produce enough food to get my family through the year. My labour is fruitful.”

And with this comforting reassurance the farmer returns to his home carrying a new lease on life in his heart and joyfully greets his wife and children after having incurred their wrath for going off to seek out ‘that bloody Messiah character’. But now they see the farmer's joy and they all rejoice as he relates the words and warmth of Jesus to them.

## “Before The Cock Crows...”

_by Ann Bendall, Sunshine Coast, Brisbane_

Peter loved Jesus so much, how could he have done this? As a child reading the bible, I was so relieved that Jesus knew that Peter was going to deny him three times before the cock crowed on the morn of his crucifixion. I knew that Jesus was capable of foretelling the future and assumed it was because his Father told him. The motive of our Father in revealing Peter's forthcoming denial, I deduced, was to lessen the disappointment of His beloved Son.

I had all of that sorted out in my mind and arrived at the conclusion that Peter was frightened and a bit of a coward. What a pleasure to be given insight into the functioning of Peter's mind!

It required the crowing of the cock to bring Peter...

> “_to his better senses, he had only thought, as he walked up and down the porch to keep warm, how cleverly he had eluded the accusations of the servants, and how he had frustrated their purpose to identify him with Jesus. For the time being, he had only considered that these servants had no moral or legal right thus to question him, and he really congratulated himself over the manner in which he thought he had avoided being identified and possibly subjected to arrest and imprisonment. Not until the cock crowed did it occur to Peter that he had denied his Master. Not untilJesus looked upon him, did he realize that he had failed to live up to his privileges as an ambassador of the kingdom._” ([UB 184:2.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_11))

How amazing is the human intellect which rationalizes thoughts and actions, irrespective of which occurs first, into a satisfactory story which aggrandizes the ego!

After describing the above, the midwayers add a “pearl”.

These are the foundation of human life and religion can help provide them.

> “_Having taken the first step along the path of compromise and least resistance, there was nothing apparent to Peter but to go on with the course of conduct decided upon. It requires a great and noble character, having started out wrong, to turn about and go right. All too often one's own mind tends to justify continuance in the path of error when once it is entered upon._” ([UB 184:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_12))

In telling of Peter's tragic denial, I ask if there is a parable for myself. How easy it is for us mortals to get onto the path of error. In our innate mental tendency to create order in our existence; to categorize and group situations and people; to seek causes for the effects of our actions and inactions, how many times am I a Peter of the early morning denials. Unlike Peter, I am not blessed with a mental cue by way of connection of the denial to the hearing of the cock crowing. Jesus gave Peter that tip, so as to quickly trigger his mind to the reality of the situation for which he was busily applauding his acumen.

I think maybe I should pray to Jesus to provide me with a cue. I get so sick and tired of spending most of my time on the wrong pathway of life. I truly want to be a great and noble character. I seem to have the innate ability to approach perfection by a process whereby I make every imaginable error and as a last resort, all thanks to the dedication of my Thought Adjuster, finally stumble onto the pathway of righteousness. And then I smile, as I remember that our beloved Creator Son has graced me with the answer to my prayer for a ‘cue’ — he has given me — _The URANTIA Book_.

## The Book — Study And Discussion

### Should The Original Text Have Been Altered?

_by Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

We have been led to believe that, following the completion of the plates for the first printing of _The URANTIA Book_, orders were given for the original URANTIA Papers to be destroyed. Hence the text for that first printing is the most authentic one now available, and is the text that future translators and scholars will need for their work.

The number of corrections made since the first printing is in excess of one hundred. Apparently some changes were made to correct the grammatical errors of the revelators. Then there are a number of textual changes that appear to have been made in attempt to correct what were perceived as errors made by the revelators.

For example, on page 477 , para 1 , the first printing stated:

> “_Each atom is a trifle over 1/100,000,000<sup>th</sup> of an inch in diameter, while an electron weighs a little more than 1/2,000<sup>th</sup> of the smallest atom, hydrogen. The positive proton, characteristic of the atomic nucleus, while it may be no larger than a negative electron, weighs almost two thousand times more._” [UB 42:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p6_7)

In the second and subsequent printings the wording was changed to “_an electron weighs a little more than 1/2000th..._” and “_weighs almost two thousand times more._”

> In My Opinion There Can Only Be One Edition Of The U.B.

Nobody could make a proofing error such as that. My correspondence with a former trustee contains these words, “I had only one experience with a textual change being made between printings. This was due to the diligence of a high school science teacher who had a B.S. in science and had read in a scientific journal that a specific figure given in _The URANTIA Book_ expressing the relationship between the mass of the nucleus and the planetary electron had changed by one digit. He was able to persuade the people at 533 to change it in the second printing... I raised quite a ruckus about the matter and it was returned to its original status in the very next printing...In my opinion there can only be one edition of the U.B., the first..” It appears that the change back demanded by this ex-trustee was never made.

There are at least eleven textual changes that seem to have been attempts to correct what were thought to be mistakes by the revelators.

These are:

[UB 0:1.24](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p1_24), “other” deleted from “all other manifestations”

[UB 37:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p8_3), “secondary” changed to “tertiary”

[UB 41:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p4_4), “sixty” changed to “forty”

[UB 42:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p6_7), “less” changed to “more”

[UB 42:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p6_7), “from two to three” changed to “almost”

[UB 42:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p7_7), “well-nigh” added before “instantaneous”

[UB 53:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p7_8), “681,227” changed to “ 681,217 ” (to agree with p. 581 — 13 plus 681,204 ‘Adams’)

[UB 79:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p5_2), “west” changed to “east”

[UB 119:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/119#p7_6), “in the manger” deleted from “newborn child in the manger”

[UB 168:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/168#p3_4), “day” changed to “week”

[UB 179:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_2), “twelve” changed to “apostles”

In agreement with my retired-trustee friend, I believe that it is imperative that all of these changes be returned to the original text. If they are genuine mistakes by the revelators then so be it. The revelators made no claim to infallibility. Neither can I conceive of any valid reason to correct supposed grammatical errors attributable to the revelators.

Many of the punctuation and spelling changes are probably real errors in proofing. When this is not in doubt, then perhaps changes are warranted, but even those should be listed in an appendix. Personally, I would prefer to stick to the unaltered text of the first printing.

I will leave it to readers to reconcile my comments with the following statement from the November 1991 issue of the Foundation's publication, ‘URANTIAN News’: “From time to time the Trustees have authorized changes which corrected spelling, grammatical, or printing errors. The current trustees are also aware of a few changes to the text undertaken in the second printing. These were corrections made necessary because of incomplete proofing of the first printing.” Few of the textual changes enumerated above appear to even resemble the normal kind of proofing error and most, if not all, appear to be attempts to rectify what were conceived to be errors by the revelators.

### Do We Have Any Idea? It's A Debatable Point

_By Max Harris, South Australia_

How I miss it, the power and thrust of ideological debate; good minds propounding ideas and better minds demolishing them.

How important to our social destiny the clashing and concord of minds can be, especially when the weapons of wit, irony, ratiocination, analogy and common logic have led to thoughtful sense winning out over silliness.

It is not an age of great debates and involving controversies. The Blaineys and the Keneallys and the Santamarias still give it a go, but they know they are merely shadow boxing.

By and large competitive ideas are expressed as a form of minor field sport, played before a mass audience of television viewers of the kind that are habitually plugged into the commercial networks. The jargon of politicians, journos and saloon bar screamers says it all.

Even the most visible modern form of testing ideas and policies, the television interview, has become a Spanish Inquisitional skill rather than an asking of hard questions which evoke revealing answers.

It is all a great pity, because there are so many issues which are for and of the present times, which could be described as ideological or socio-philosophical, and of some urgency.

A completely different and new age of superpowerdom is coming upon us at high speed. Do we respond by rationalising the idiotic State-Federal divisions of responsibility that bedevil any attempts at dynamic management of our economy and social cohesion?

There is the Australia that lives in the under-educated heads of the young, the psychic instability of the mature, in the values held by one area of the country as against another. The tyranny of distance is an outmoded cliche. The tyranny of insulated thinking is a reality. The country is divided by more factors than simple migrant multiculturalism.

It matters not. The fact is that the world is reshaping its powers and forces and especially its future sets of relationships at such a whizzbang speed that our little noodles can't keep up with it.

It is not that the shock of the new is not being recorded and reported and ideologically analysed by our much maligned media. I am proud of the quality press for the almost quixotic fashion in which good minds with polymathic abilities are recruited and their prognostic thoughts published.

The best is in danger of being degraded, through the domination of the public mentality, by the worst.

But it is the nature of the aural and visual media to subsume that its patrons possess a short attention span.The convulsive changes in the power and policy configurations of the big distant outside world have to be conveyed in what I understand are called “ 60 -second grabs”. The mass of people are fed endless impressionism which they absorb with minimal understanding.

And that is why most of us are reacting to vast historic global change with catatonic mental insulation.

Gifted ideologues may write for newspapers and what they write may be read by the literate minority. But changed modes of thinking and economic behavioural responses have to come from the whole community. Otherwise tomorrow's Australia will still be today's Australia preserved in the aspic of ignorance. We will pay the price for it, the price for shrivelled minds in a time which calls for sharpened reflexes from ordinary people.

> A completely different and new age of super-powerdom is coming upon us at high speed.

Our pastors and masters are of no help. They have fallen into the trap of exploiting the electronic media to communicate immediate urgencies. It can't be done via the short attention span and the expediency of pandering to shallow minds with shallow thinking.

All that comes across is the good old bloke syndrome. I am the same as you. I am an ideological bankrupt like you. I, too, am the living endorsement of the contented ‘she's right’ mediocrity, just like you viewers.

The world is remaking itself and I have a sense of impending danger, especially for Australia. I have a feeling we are including ourselves out.

The blockage that causes this is the communication problem, that is, the media. The line of communication from ideologues, from those with speculative expertise, runs via politicians through the media to the public. But in the process politicians trivialise because the electronic media make their profits through trivialisation. Even Sartre would admit that this is a pretty vicious old circle.

So there I am. I read the serious thinkers on what's happening and what will happen. New patterns of power and poverty are shaping up in a context which may involve vicious wars of fanatic, newly-awakened nationalism. Will a new order co-exist with a new chaos?

It is frustrating that not even such questions are entertaining the consciousness of ordinary people. Until we know the questions we can't prepare the national psyche for the changes to be made within the national character and within ourselves.

We will remain the dumb country, dedicated to the philosophy that this is the future that was. Whoosh!

## On Reflection

### Keep The Faith

_By Lee Lester, Saratosa, Florida_

We greatly enjoyed the recent celebration of the Master's birth on our planetary home. Although we couldn't gather together in one place as we are scattered from one end of the planet to the other, the brotherhood of faith sons were united in spirit if not in locality. The newsletters after the event seemed like the echo of the same note — “This was definitely the best yet.” We in Sarasota, Florida, USA, like many others, observed the remembrance of Michael's planetary bestowal. Our's was a joyous occasion, commemorating the life Jesus lived among his fellows and the faith he had for their faith in his Father. Our thoughts were turned back like pages in time to the evening when Jesus established the remembrance with his mortal associates so long ago.

The twelve arrived at the upper chamber before the Master. They noticed pitchers of water, the basins, and towels for washing their dusty feet, but no servant had been provided to render this service. The apostles began to think to themselves, each one refusing in his own heart to act as a servant to the others.

As they stood there debating in their hearts, they surveyed the seating arrangement of the table. Traditionally the preferred guest reclined at the seat of honor to the left of the host. A certain apostle chose this place for himself, setting in motion a scene of angry recriminations, personal exultation, and uncomplimentary remarks.

When the Master appeared in the doorway, the room fell quiet. Jesus looked at each one and eased the tension with a smile.

“_Why are you so slow to learn that the secret of greatness in the spirit is not like the methods of power in the material world?_”

“_Jesus feared none of those who sought his spiritual overthrow anymore than those who sought his death. He had but one anxiety, the safety and salvation of his earthly brethren._”

“_Now the Master instituted a new remembrance as a symbol of the new dispensation, a new spirit wherein the enslaved individual emerges from the bondage of ceremonialism and selfishness into the spiritual joy of the brotherhood of the liberated faith sons of the living God._”

We have all had experiences when beliefs have caused divisions between even the closest associates. Faith on the other hand, unites those who share even the most diverse beliefs. If you were to search for the definition of belief in the dictionary, you would find the word ‘faith’. Likewise if you sought the word ‘faith’, you would find the word 'belief. The only way to know the true meaning of either is through living experience.

At some point in our experience we may even find it necessary to choose between what we believe and the faith we have within. Jesus walked this path as a young boy when he made his first journey to Jerusalem with his parents.

Jesus would not accept belief in the wrath of God or the anger of the Almighty. When his father became mildly insistent that he accept the orthodox Jewish beliefs, Jesus refused to believe anything that should assault his faith in his Paradise Father's love.

Diversity of beliefs unquestionably provides the basis for insightful exchange between progressive and truth searching personalities, but as Jesus demonstrated through a faith-choice decision, the highest ideal should never be sacrificed for an inferior idea.

Each of us are the captains of our own ships. The indwelling fragments of Deity are the pilots charting the course of progressive evolutionary destiny, but as the Master once said, “_faith is like the sails of a ship_”. And unless the sails of our ship are hoisted up, the ship will either drift aimlessly, remain motionless, or can even flounder and crash when the waves of adversity strike.

Jesus also once said, “_if you have faith that your Paradise Father loves you with an infinite love, you are already in the kingdom of heaven_”. This faith can only be realized by trusting in God's infinite goodness.

The religion of Jesus Christ will forever stand in contrast to complicated, intricate, and dictatorial forms of philosophical beliefs. So simple, that even the most wide-eyed child can understand: God loves you and we are all his children.

### When all is said and done..

> “Jesus' usual technique of social contact was to draw people out and into talking with him by asking them questions. The interview would usually begin by his asking them questions and end by their asking him questions. He was equally adept in teaching by either asking or answering questions. As a rule, to those he taught the most, he said the least.” ([UB 132:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p4_2))
