## Editor's Notebook

### One Hundred

Milestones occur because a good number of people contribute with a sustained effort to a shared vision.

To each person involved with Six-O-Six in a myriad of ways since 1980 , congratulations for a great publishing effort.

The future of Six-O-Six? A continuation of our independence and a determination to do the best we can to bring the world a little closer together.

In commemorating this centennial edition, it is a time for us to be at one for a moment, to review our purpose, and consider the future.

As stated in our only policy, this publication exists to serve the interests of readers of _The URANTIA Book_. The readers! Not any single organization or special interest group. Alienation felt can only arise from inaction, for Six-0-Six provides a public arena for opinions to face the light of day.

Sectional interests have one goal — to see their viewpoint accepted by the majority. Their commendable courage of conviction can however be subverted by their moral high ground and professed indignation.

At all times the general interest and common good must be protected from groups who might feign support, yet would express hostility to those who question their view of the world.

We are in the business of unravelling a major revelation. The market place of ideas is ruthless towards ideals. So it will always be easier for vested interests to challenge publications on their motivation. It would be preferable to see the issues that are raised demolished by counterargument.

Backroom critics fear freedom of the press. We say speak up!

But let's all endure the cost of evaluating the special interest in order to determine the general interest. Only issues withheld from scrutiny have the potential to cause damage.

Contributors in their articles present their thoughts their ‘facts’. The implications affect readers as individual members of the community. Their collective response represents public opinion, and only as such, does this publication presume to ‘form’ public opinion.

Opinion unacceptable to the scrutiny of time does not damage the book. Its basic contents have remained unassailed for 2000 years.

Nor can that opinion damage Six-0-Six, The Fellowship, study groups or the URANTIA Foundation, undeservedly. Insomuch as the article is misguided, it is the writer's credibility that is damaged.

We need to be team players, flexible of mind, or many's the opportunity that shall be squandered. When ignored, history re-surfaces as current affairs.

Readers are tremendously supportive of each other. It's great! Without such activity, including well-intentioned criticism, the work will stagnate. If ever we are suppressed, the suppressor shall be vanquished.

How glorious our right to question, disagree with, implore, review, reflect, decide, wait... as we strive to retain objectivity.

The process of democracy — free will — requires open and rational debate. The currency is the teachings in _The URANTIA Book_. The agenda is God's will.

The policies we thereby decree must provide spiritual opportunities in the context of economic and social realities.

## So They Say

**“On Writing Christian Fiction for Children” by Veronica Heley**

I aim to put across the message simply but clearly, with the emphasis on a loving God. Of course there are ‘don't do this’ warnings — like don't lie to your friends or you'll end up without any — but the main thrust of the Christian message is a positive one. Love God. Love your neighbour. God loves you.

**Australian Consumer Association Magazine**

Corporations and governments want to establish industries based on the genetic manipulation of wild and domestic plants, animals, and micro-organisms. They envisage products with the potential to revolutionize agriculture, industry, human health care, environmental management, waste treatment, and minerals recovery.

**Habitat Australia**

Global trends in declining frog populations were indisputable. Existing on earth for 230 million years with a body form much like that of modern species, frogs have outlasted countless other species. They have survived the ice ages and global warmings. Any synchronous decline in frog populations should therefore be taken seriously.

**21-C Magazine**

The way forward now is back to our soul's world of happiness, naturalness, peace, and sensitivity. The 21 st century won't be a world of escapist high-tech plastic and glitter, as we are currently told. Rather, it will be a world of nature and fellowship; a world free of ego, aggression, and alienation. The human condition has ended. [Oh Yeah?]

## Letters To The Editor

_Geoff Lund, Runaway Bay, Queensland_

In the November/December issue of Six-O-Six there appear to be two sections closely related that account to a large extent for the emptying of the formal churches.

The first is a quote from Quadrant. It states (page 2), “Let Bishops stick more to prayer etc. etc.” The second is the article by John Hyde (page 7) who states in his opening paragraph that the church has largely given the ‘Morality’ game away.

Personally, I eventually gave away an established church (Anglican) when as a Parochial Councillor and what else, I was prepared to stand shoulder to shoulder with the local Rector in a matter in which I$ believed and he believed the Diocesan Council had acted immorally. The Rector stated that he did not wish to raise a storm as it could affect his elevation in the church. (Some years later he died immediately prior to being installed as a Bishop in a capital city.)

Another person who led various women's groups and was looked upon as important in the church admonished me as she claimed we had to look at expediency, even though she also believed the action to be immoral. No other councillor was game, although I know most agreed with my view, to stand up and be counted. The cock will crow thrice.

Believing, and probably rightly so, that all other churches faced similar pangs of conscience, I eventually became ‘unattached’. The years in the wilderness gave me great time for contemplation and a complete review of what I did believe, what the churches did, and what really was man's relationship to God.

Then the miracle(?) happened and yours and my old friend Joe Hausler introduced me to the Book. So much of what I suppose I worked out in my sub-conscious(?) became crystal-clear particularly as I read the life of Jesus probably for the third time. I cannot now even say that I have read every word in the Book. That would be more than ten years ago that Joe introduced me to it.

Wouldn't it be wonderful if we could in some way encourage the Bishops and other ordained persons and those seeking spiritual help, direction, and guidance to read, learn, and absorb the Life of Jesus. Just that section alone would open an amazing spiritual world to the seekers after truth who really do abound in large numbers — see those in newspapers condemning religion and churches — WHY ? Are they not really seekers after truth who are disillusioned and no wonder? That would form an essay on its own. The life of Jesus and other sections will put the Bible in perspective as its contradictions worry many people; but they know nowhere else to go.

All we read in the press, hear on the air and see on television are eminent church people acting as if they are the Social Security Department or telling governments what economic policies they should adopt, or how else to run the country. God and religion run a very poor fourth or fifth. Should not these people be trying to convey to the people the basic concepts of love of God and mankind. They are attacking the results of their own ineptness, not the causes. Of course we must have compassion for the sick, the maimed, the poor and the lost souls. No amount of monetary handouts will solve that problem. Ask Mother Teresa. Ask our own Aborigines. Love will, though.

I recall a couple of lines from the Ballad of Beau Brocade which reads:

“Whitefield preached to the colliers grim,
Bishops in lawn sleeves preached at him”.

Perhaps nothing much has changed, but it must and it will. It is up to us.

### “The Meaning Of Life”

_Tony Rudd, Melbourne_

When I first showed a copy of _The URANTIA Book_ to my mother, she had one look inside the cover, saw it was published in Chicago, and dismissed it out of hand.

My father showed an interest. I lent him a copy and, although it graced his coffee table for a couple of years, it remained un-read. I took it back.

I then had a long, hard look at my overall “conversion rate” of getting people on to the Book. In the five or so years I have been a reader, I discovered that to the best of my knowledge, I had succeeded in introducing no-one. Zero. “Selling” the Book doesn't appear to work for me, although it clearly does for others.

I then thought about the possibility of “selling” the inspiration of the Book, rather than selling the Book itself. One, of course, would lead to the other. I then set about the task of putting together my version about what I thought the Book was saying.

After more drafts than I care to remember, I ended up with a script which I then committed to cassette tape. I don't mention the Book in the tape at all. I even decided to not even mention the word “God” in the title in order to increase its breadth of appeal. I eventually settled on the title “The Meaning of Life” and the recording lasts around forty minutes. If anyone is interested in the tape, I am supplying copies free of charge. If you would like one, please write to me at:

_PO Box 281, Ashburton, Victoria, Australia, 3147._

I have had reasonably good response to the tape so far, so it at least appears that some people find it a useful tool to add to their tool box in helping spread God's truth around the world.

## News Around The World

### 10th Annual Conference In Australia

This year's annual conference will be held from October 9-12, 1992 at The William Arnott Lodge, Elanora Heights, Sydney.

The theme will be “Human Nature and the Twelve Apostles”.

The conference will be hosted by the Sydney Study group who look forward to meeting new and old friends.

Further details on registration to follow in future issues.

### The Third International Meeting Of _The Urantia Book_ Readers

This takes place in France from August 1-8, 1992.

The theme of the meeting is “To Have — To Be — To Do.” As stated in their brochure: Having _The URANTIA Book_ is one of the means at our disposal to lead us to being sons of God, those very sons who produce in their daily life abundant fruits of the spirit; it is doing the will of the Father in all we do.

For further information contact the organizers.

_Blennes, France._

### A Trip To Heaven?

In marked contrast to Tony Rudd's tape, a series of twelve tapes at a cost of $60 is currently being marketed under the headline:

“I walked in Heaven with Jesus”

The copy goes on to claim: “Five and a half days of glorious experiences inside of Heaven talking with the apostles, the prophets, the archangels, and hearing the voice of God”.

The ads have attracted the attention of the Australian Direct Marketing Association, who are “doubtful that the author can conclusively prove his claim”.

Interesting to note that ‘Marketing’, the magazine which ran this story, also carried a large display ad for the suspect tapes.

### Fusla Affiliation

The First URANTIA Society of Los Angeles (FUSLA) has voted to affiliate with the Fellowship. FUSLA is the eighteenth of twenty-one societies to join the Fellowship.

### More On Text And Copyright

_William Wentworth, Towamba, N.S.W._

I find myself in complete agreement with Ken Glasziou (January/February 1992) over preserving the original text of _The URANTIA Book_. If it is not practicable to alter future editions, then it may be admissable to include an appendix listing all alterations from the original text. This would provide, at very little cost, the basic information required.

However, I cannot agree with the attitude of the Sunshine Coast Study Group (SCSG) towards the copyright. The copyright, as they point out, may not be strictly necessary, but it is extremely useful.

In their article, the SCSG ask five questions:

_1. Can a person really own a divine revelation?_

Well, no, of course not! But this divine revelation is presented in the form of a book, and the Urantia Foundation took responsibility for the task of protecting the text. It has performed that task very well, at least until recently. In our civilisation, the technique for protecting texts is copyright, and so naturally enough the text which the Foundation is protecting is said to be “owned” by the Foundation. But this is an entirely different matter from claiming to “own a divine revelation.” The revelation is for all mankind, and is not owned by anyone. The existence of copyright over the text does not alter this unless, for some reason, Urantia Foundation should try to restrict access to the text. Urantia Foundation would hardly be likely to attempt to do this as one of its main functions is to make the text available to anyone sincerely interested in it. Refusing to allow corruption of the text by the ownership of copyright is not to be confused with claiming ownership of the revelation itself.

_2. Is it likely that our celestial supervisors would grant authority to the Foundation trustees to assert control over utilization of the Fifth Epochal Revelation?_

Likely or not, apparently they did give the Foundation the responsibility of preserving the text of _The URANTIA Book_, and the Trustees, very properly in my view, sought the legal protection of copyright.

The conflict taking place at the moment has nothing to do with the copyright itself, but rather grows out of recent attempts by the Trustees to establish tighter control over efforts to spread the revelation. My understanding is that the Trustees decided to impede the activities of some of the more radical evangelists in the (former) Urantia Brotherhood, and used ownership of the copyright as a weapon in their campaign. The radicals refused to be muzzled; the Trustees persisted in their attempts to control them. Neither side was prepared to compromise and so now the copyright is under threat. It is profoundly to be hoped that the copyright survives intact. It is not the source of the problem, but simply a weapon in an ideological dispute.

_3. What are the likely consequences of loss of copyright of _The URANTIA Book_?_

The loss of the copyright would end the Foundation's legal power to prevent corruption of the text. I have no real idea as to how likely it is that such corruption will actually occur, but a casual glance around some of the current “spiritual” enthusiasms and fashions certainly gives ground for genuine concern. There are some very unscrupulous movements and leaders in both America and Australia who may well feel that a selective adaptation of certain parts of _The URANTIA Book_ could help them spread their message. Only the copyright prevents this style of misuse of the text.

> Refusing to allow corruption of the text by the ownership of copyright is not to be confused with claiming ownership of the revelation itself.

It is, of course, true that the copyright does expire in a couple of decades, and this problem will have to be tolerated then, anyway. But the longer the expiration is delayed, the greater will be the number of sincere readers of the unadulterated text to argue for its authenticity, and the greater will be the number of such texts in libraries, bookstores and private hands to balance the influence of corrupt texts.

This, incidentally, is one of the chief reasons why it is useful to increase the sale of books, even to people who do not read them very often, as a bank of books will be on bookshelves in all sorts of likely and unlikely places where their sheer numbers may help to undermine the authority of rival corrupt texts.

The final two questions asked by the SCSG need no further comment. It is true that we readers of _The URANTIA Book_ have not exactly covered ourselves in glory in this dispute over the copyright. Nevertheless, I am one reader who thinks the copyright is valuable enough to be worth a bit of a fight.

### “Is Copyright Really Necessary?”

_Further Comments, By Ann Bendall, Nambour, Queensland_

As a member of the Sunshine Coast Study Group, I would like to expand on a point raised by ourselves in the previous issue of Six-O-Six on the need or otherwise for copyright.

We feel that there may be confusion in folks' minds between copyright per se, and the need for the production of an inviolate copy of _The URANTIA Book_. Judged by all of the evidence available to us, we feel that the mandate from the Revelators was only for the latter.

The human custodians of _The URANTIA Book_, in their wisdom, attempted to fulfil their mandate by means of taking out the copyright. This was an interpretation of the requirements of the Revelators, which perhaps had some beneficial effects during the “heady” early days of the Urantia movement.

However, the copyright was, as we see it, purely a human idea. An inviolate copy of the book could have, and still can be, produced with or without copyright protection.

It appears that the copyright has always caused problems within the movement. It has come to represent a powerful asset which is fought over with embarrassing regularity.

Worse still, the price paid by all those involved in arguing over, trying to enforce, attempting to thwart, destroy, or gain possession of copyright, serves to delay the further development of The Brotherhood of Man so beautifully envisaged in the book.

A human creation which satisfies human needs by utilizing human laws is being placed as of higher import than the teaching and living of the book. The tragic side-effect is that it is destroying the credibility of all who hold themselves up as believing in _The URANTIA Book_'s teachings — for we are seen to be breaking Jesus' greatest commandments.

### In The Real World, Inequality Is Only Natural.

_by Ronald Conway, Melbourne_

“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by the creator with certain inalienable rights.”

So runs the famous preamble to the American Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776. This is the fundamental statement behind the ideal (but hardly the reality) of modern democratic government.

What a pity it isn't true!

Indeed the American republic and its part-imitations, such as the Australian Commonwealth, rest upon a basic doctrine that modern science does not support and the founder of Christianity never taught.

There is nothing “self-evident” about human equality, even before the State and the law. Even the grandfather of all modern political mischief-makers, Jean Jacques Rousseau, was forced to admit that the whole notion was merely a noble concoction of the mind.

We are certainly not “created equal” but to a wide variety of inherited and environmental circumstances that clearly limit our options in life and therefore much of our freedom.

The late B.F. Skinner, doyen of American behavioural psychologists, even went so far as to dismiss the whole idea that we are socially free as a romantic political delusion.

With the classless society, all conventional inequalities could be erased. Even the Catholic church then contributed its portion by spreading the now familiar catchcry of “social justice”, which was ironically often at variance with its own authoritarian ecclesiastical structure.

Strangely corresponding with the recent collapse of socialism has come an increasing body of research evidence in psychology and biology that nature — via natural selection and genetics — is usually more important in the human development than the shaping factors of later environment.

If so, we are forced to face the reality that nature itself, and indeed the whole known universe, does not provide a level playing field. We see an immensely complex hierarchy of entities and events in which each phenomenon and creature has its own appropriate slot. Because of our superior intellects and skills, humans may substantially vary, modify or compensate for the pressures of this natural hierarchy. But they can neither abolish it nor stand aside from it. We, too, are creatures of the natural order — a fact which the arrogance of recent technology has often caused us to forget.

One of the most fascinating research projects of recent decades — and perhaps unrepeatable — is the famous Minnesota twins study, whose findings by Dr Thomas Bouchard were published in October last year. One hundred sets of identical twins sharing exactly the same genetic structure, from several parts of the world, were assembled for study. Each twin in every pair had been reared apart from birth.

A hundred cases does not sound very many in global terms, but considering the rarity of such examples, it constitutes a very powerful research project indeed. Bouchard studied the progress of the twins since 1979, and produced a detailed study of the role of nature versus nurture, which is like nothing before it. His conclusions were that the effects of inherited characteristics in youthful development outweighed those from the environment by three to one.

I was not at all surprised to hear that the intelligence (insofar as it can be measured) was more inherited than acquired, but the finding that personality characteristics were similarly weighted in favour of inheritance was startling.

Bouchard has hastened to point out that the power of families, parents and peers to shape our development, while less potent than originally thought, is still very significant. This is particularly true if parents are bright, resourceful and persistent.

Critics have pointed out that the Minnesota study may have produced a self-selecting group with only those twins who are very similar tending to present themselves. The argument is far from settled, but most recent studies of genetic influences tend to favour Bouchard's conclusions.

We are certainly not “created equal” but to a wide variety of inherited and environmental circumstances that clearly limit our options in life and therefore much of our freedom.

The social significance of such findings can hardly be underestimated. Many random questions offer themselves. Are we wasting too much effort and money trying to raise the educational standard of untalented children who can gain little benefit from the exercise? Are many criminals beyond any hope of rehabilitation because of “bad genes”?

In refusing to discourage breeding among the handicapped and underprivileged while failing to persuade the gifted to have more children, are we loading the genetic dice in favour of cultural backwardness and decay?

Such embarrassing questions will doubtless turn the faces of many modern clerics, social planners, and civil libertarians a bright purple. To them, all human creatures must be uniformly precious.
But merely announcing such a conviction in the media, public forums or from pulpits does not make it a fact of nature. The Christian gospel merely proclaims human beings as being spiritually beloved and equal as souls in the sight of God.

To extend the vision beyond this point is not to invoke the Christian ethic but merely to sing along with Rousseau, Jefferson, Marx and all their other chums.

The most that modern “democracy” can hope to bring about is to provide decent opportunities for every person according to his or her capacity and motivation. To deny the wide variety, and therefore natural inequality, of the human species is to mouth political cant.

It is also dangerous cant because out of it the bloodiest revolutions of our century have been hatched. It is not essential to human happiness that we all enjoy the same status and possessions as our neighbours, but to use what we have wisely and well.

> “_While a good environment cannot contribute much toward realty overcoming the character handicaps. of a base heredity, a bad environment can very effectively spoil an excellent inheritance, at least during the younger years of life._” ([UB 76:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p2_6))

### Only The Best

_Reprinted From “The Diary”._

The best things in life are free we are told (except for pizzas, chocolates, ice creams...)

But how often do people say those words without thinking of their real meaning?

The best things in life cost dearly — but not in terms of money.

My list of things I consider best are: the love of the man I love; the development of my children into happy, useful members of the community; the chance to bring a little joy to the world; the opportunity to help another person grow emotionally; and of course, the freedom to worship God in the way I believe is right.

The cost of having all that is high indeed. They all require huge investments of my self, my time, my knowledge, and my skills.

Naturally the time and effort I put into expressing my feelings for my loved ones is given gladly, but there are also hidden costs. Sometimes I feel emotionally drained by the effort of balancing all the roles I fill — home, work, committees, hobbies.

But the compensation for loving is great joy and bliss. The love from my family gives me so much strength, happiness, and laughter that my soul and mind are nurtured and once again restored.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### A Statistical Investigation Of Writing Styles In The Urantia Papers

_by Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

#### Introduction

_The URANTIA Book_ claims that it is a revelation given to we mortals by celestial and other-than-human beings. When first introduced to this book, I assumed that it had been written by a committee of well-meaning academics on a save-the-world mission. On becoming more familiar with the content of the book, I was impressed by the quality and consistency of its message, but also noticed material of a scientific nature that could only have been guesswork at the time of receipt of the Papers. It did not make sense that a group of obviously knowledgeable and talented authors would risk jeopardizing acceptance of their work by including contentious prophetic material, particularly as the book could easily have earned recognition as a philosophical and religious work of great merit.

There have been suggestions that various single authors wrote _The URANTIA Book_ — Dr W. Sadler, Wilfred Kellogg, Carl Jung, H.G. Wells, and Robert Millikin being among those named.

There are many ways by which investigators have attempted to verify or deny authorship of documents. For example the Epistles attributed to Paul in the New Testament have long been a subject for investigation. One of the methods for investigating authorship is based on style analysis, as authors tend to stamp their personal idiosyncrasies on documents that they produce. A method that was used for the Pauline letters was based on the number of sentences having zero, one, two,...occurrences of ‘kai’ (Morton, 1965).

Recent advances in computer technology and the existence of excellent search programs have made possible the investigation of even lengthy works. The methods chosen by this author to investigate _The URANTIA Book_ were largely dictated by the convenience in which facts of a statistical nature could be extracted from a FolioViews database for the book.

Initially a very simple approach was made in which it was attempted to demonstrate that there was a style difference between Parts 1,2, and 3, taken as a whole, and Part 4. The reason for this choice was that the Papers in Parts 1-3 were all stated to be written by celestial beings whereas the authors for Part 4 (the midwayers) are stated to be terrestrial. When this analysis indicated that the two components were indeed significantly different, the work was extended to test each of the parts separately, and then some individual authors, or groups of authors, were selected for investigation.

The method chosen was to determine the number of occasions sentences commenced with a particular marker word, a method used by Mosteller and Wallace. Those chosen were: ‘how’, ‘when’, ‘and’, ‘but’, ‘this’. A second study also used marker words described by Mosteller and Wallace as ‘function’ words, such as ‘also’, ‘an’, ‘by’, etc.

#### Method

The FolioViews search program, in combination with a URANTIA Book database, will give the frequency of occurrence and position of any individual word in the whole book, the frequency and location of combinations of words in a paragraph, or the frequency and location of phrases in paragraphs. For example to find a phrase such as “son of God”, the words must be enclosed in inverted commas otherwise one obtains paragraphs in which all three words occur, but not necessarily as a phrase. This same method can also be used to obtain the frequency and position of occurrence of words that start or end a sentence. To locate sentences commencing with a particular word, one searches for a period followed by a space then the required word. To find sentences that end with a particular word, the word followed by a period is adequate. In both cases the search phrase must be in inverted commas.

> Recent advances in computer technology and the existence of excellent search programs have made possible the investigation of even lengthy works. The methods chosen by this author to investigate _The URANTIA Book_ were largely dictated by the convenience in which facts of a statistical nature could be extracted from a FolioViews database for the book.

For the purposes of a first investigation, the papers were split as follows: Foreword (pages 1-20); Part 1 (pages 21-354); Divine Counselor Papers (pages 21-107); Part 2 (pages 357-648); Part 3 (pages 651-1307); Life Carrier Papers (pages 651-740); Melchizedek Papers (pages 1003-1175); Solitary Messenger Papers (pages 1176-1240); Papers 120 and 121 (pages 1308-1331); and Part 4, The Jesus Papers (pages 1332-2097). The Chi Square distribution was used for all statistical testing. The Table shows the words that were used as those beginning sentences and the various comparisons that were made, together with the Chi Squared estimate of probability that the parameters tested were truly independent.

It has been proposed that Dr Sadler was capable of writing the scientific, geological and biological material describing the early history of the earth (Papers 57-62), the Papers providing an in-depth cover on religion and theology (Part 1 and Papers 99-107), as well as Part IV (The Life and Teachings of Jesus). A second study was undertaken to investigate whether these papers were indeed written by a single author. In this case, marker words suggested by Mosteller and Wallace such as ‘an’, ‘also’, ‘upon’, ‘by’, ‘there’, ‘this’, etc., were used to test this hypothesis following procedures suggested by Kenny (1982).

A third study was conducted on the only available sample of Dr Sadler's writings, a 1946 public lecture of about 6000 words entitled “The Evolution of the Soul.” This was scanned onto computer disk and converted to both Word Perfect and a FolioViews database. Slightly more than 50% of the text consisted of verbatim quotations from _The URANTIA Book_. This was separated from the remainder of the text and analyzed using a style analysis computer program (Readability Plus).

#### Conclusions

When tested by use of the Chi Square distribution, the hypothesis that the Foreword, and Parts 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all distinct works was highly significant for the words ‘when’, ‘and’, ‘but’, and ‘this’. No sentences in the Foreword commenced with the word ‘how’, but the use of sentences commencing with this word indicated that Parts 1, 2 and 3 were distinctly different from Part 4.

Parts of the book attributed to Divine Counselors, Life Carriers, Melchizedeks, and a Solitary Messenger were also found to be distinguishable. The results presented in the Table indicate that there may have been in excess of nine authors of _The URANTIA Book_.

The second study showed that Papers 57-62 differ from Papers 99-107 (P = 0.01)
; Papers 57-62 differ from Part 4 (P = 0.001); Papers 99-107 differ from Part 1 (P = 0.01); and Papers 99-107 differ from Part 4 (P = 0.001). Hence the postulate of single authorship for combinations of this material is not supported.

<figcaption>Hey Mac, the UB is right after all!.</figcaption>
</figure>

The third study on Dr Sadler's published lecture “The Evolution of the Soul”, of which more than half is verbatim quotations from _The URANTIA Book_, clearly differentiated two distinct writing styles on the basis of sentence structure (P = 0.005), sentence length (P = 0.05), and the Flesch Reading Ease Index (P = 0.05).

Besides indicating that Dr Sadler did not write _The URANTIA Book_, the results of this investigation add another dimension to the task of objectifying claims that human agencies may have compiled _the URANTIA Book_. It now becomes necessary also to offer a rational explanation on how the involvement of so many outstanding individuals in such a major task could have been kept totally secret over a period exceeding fifty years. A further problem is how the remarkable consistency of the material found in this book could be maintained by multiple human authors (or even a single author) working well before the days when computer search programs and data bases became available.

### A Vision For The Future

_by the Sunshine Coast Study Group_

The rate of change in our present day society is so rapid as to negate almost any attempt to envision what the long-term future may hold. So let's not get carried away with any concept of converting Urantia to a light and life planet within the next thousand years. Perhaps a first task should be to limit ourselves to trying to convert the potentially convertible. But where do we start?

Currently there are three groups among which teachings from _The URANTIA Book_ have the potential to make headway. Firstly, there are all those people in dominantly Christian countries who have, for one reason or another, failed to become involved in any depth with the Christian churches. The ingrained thinking of these peoples is very much conditioned by 2000 years of Christian heritage.

A second is the followers of Islam, at least some of whom would subscribe to the concept of the fatherhood of a God who is love, and of the brotherhood of all men.

The third group is the one in which there is perhaps the greatest immediate potential, the congregations of the mainline Christian churches. Excepting for those with strong fundamentalist views, all that is really needed is a shift in emphasis of teaching rather than a radical reconstruction of theology. Relatively few practicing Christians would be able to write a thesis on doctrines such as atonement and transubstantiation. Many, possibly most, would not know what the terms really mean. However, _The URANTIA Book_ teaches that a frontal attack upon erroneous beliefs or outmoded doctrines is not the way to go; the better way is to allow truth to do its own work in displacing error.

There are already signs that fundamentalism is waning among the mainline churches. The CatholicStudy Edition of the Good News Bible, first printed in 1979, carries scholarly essays on bible history that make it quite clear that their Roman Catholic authors do not pursue the fundamentalist notion that the bible is the infallible word of God. This is also recognized in a document of the Second Vatican Council on revelation (Dei Verbum \#11) which acknowledges that the individual authors of biblical texts worked in full freedom under divine inspiration, each in accordance with their individual nature and character.

The demise of the 3rd Epochal Revelation and the limited success of the 4th should teach us something. Melchizedek had warned his followers to teach about the one God, the Father and Maker Of All and to preach a definite gospel concerning the truth of the reality of the Universal Father. The missionaries in Mesopotamia attempted too much, they preached a moral standard too high for the people and in one generation the Salem headquarters at Kish came to an end. (1043)

Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom, the Fatherhood of God, our sonship with the Father, and the brotherhood of all men. He spoke of a spiritual kingdom in the hearts of men. However his disciples were quite unable to give up their concepts of an earthly messianic kingdom. They converted Jesus' death on the cross into a sacrificial act for the forgiveness of sins, a doctrine that brought enormous relief to the poor, the sick, and the unfortunate who believed that their lot was a punishment for sin. Later Christian doctrine failed to come to terms with an apparent contradiction between the perfect love and mercy of God and the perfect righteousness and justice of God; hence the atonement doctrine lives on to the present day. _The URANTIA Book_ teaches that:

> “_The affectionate heavenly Father, whose spirit indwells his children on earth, is not a divided personality — one of justice and one of mercy — neither does it require a mediator to secure the Father's favor or forgiveness. Divine righteousness is not dominated by strict retributive justice; God as a father transcends God as a judge._” ([UB 2:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p6_6))

The concept of a Father-God who is love and our sonship with the Father not only predicates the brotherhood of all men, but also has the potential to displace the atonement doctrine. Both of these concepts have scriptural backing in the New Testament. The Lord's prayer begins with the words ‘Our Father’ and the concept that we are sons and children of the Father has backing in the gospels of Matthew, Luke, and John, in Paul's letters to the Romans, Galatians, and Philippians, and in 1 John. The latter also tells us that God is love.

The gospels of the New Testament state that Jesus and the disciples went about the countryside preaching the gospel of the kingdom. This gospel could have had nothing in common with the post-resurrectional doctrines concerning salvation from sin through the cross. The original gospel is discoverable from teachings in the Sermon on the Mount and the parables that portray God as one who, far from condemning sinners, goes out to recover them and welcome their return with great joy. These are the familiar parables such as the lost sheep, the lost coin, and the prodigal son, the last being one in which the father does not wait for the son to return and seek forgiveness but dashes out to welcome him home even prior to that forgiveness being requested. In none of these stories does Jesus hint that a sacrifice is necessary before his Father will forgive the sinner.

On still other occasions, the gospel stories tell that Jesus readily forgave sin to those who sought healing, but without any sacrificial offering being required. Thus there is adequate New Testament backing for the gospel of the kingdom as portrayed in _The URANTIA Book_.

_The URANTIA Book_ has made little obvious headway in the churches over the past forty years. If its teachings are being incorporated into present day Christian teaching, it is being done without reference to the book itself. It is not consistent with the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ that its revelators would demand credit for such incorporation. If that is the most effective way of fulfilling one of the aspirations mentioned among its teachings, then so be it:

> “_The time is ripe to witness the figurative resurrection of the human Jesus from his burial tomb amidst the theological and religious dogmas of nineteen centuries. Jesus of Nazareth must no longer be sacrificed to even the splendid concept of the glorified Christ. What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions!_” ([UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2))

How can URANTIA Book readers hasten the process? It should already be apparent that the clergy, even those who know of its existence, are not going to announce the 5th Epochal Revelation from the rooftops. Considered reflection may lead to the conclusion that not even the Pope himself could do this without splitting the church asunder. The same careful reflection may also indicate that a better course of action would be slow evolution rather than destructive revolution. So how do we get the primary teachings of the gospel of the kingdom at the forefront of the main body of church dogma? First let's consider what these teachings may be.

### Our Mandate

1. _We will love the Lord our God with all our hearts, with all our minds and with all our souls._
2. _As children of the Father, we are obligated to love one another as Jesus loves us._
3. _In our group worship, we practice the presence of God._
4. _We believe that Jesus' Spirit of Truth dwells with us to guide us into all truth._
5. _We believe that the Spirit of the Father dwells within us as part of us, forever._
6. _We believe that God is love and that love transcends all else._
7. _It is our will that we do the will of God._
8. _We aspire to be like God as he is revealed to us in the life of Jesus._
9. _We aspire with all our hearts to divine unselfishness, truth, beauty, and goodness._
10. _Having discovered God as our spiritual Father, we no longer have servant status, but are truly his children, brothers and sisters in the family of God._

The experience of church-going URANTIA Book readers has already revealed that seeking to draw the attention of fellow church-goers to the book is not very fruitful. It is not easy to alter in adults, those ingrained habits of thinking already acquired in childhood. So can we start with the children? The answer to that is Eyes', it can be done in normal religious instruction classes and Sunday Schools through the simple expedient of emphasizing the essential teachings of Jesus about the kingdom. Surely, though, the most rewarding way to promulgate these teachings throughout Christianity is by means of well written and illustrated children's books. For the immediate future that is surely the most urgent need. If you have the necessary talents, _The URANTIA Book_ bids you to use them.

> “_The religious challenge of this age is to those farseeing and forward-looking men and women of spiritual insight who will dare to construct a new and appealing philosophy of living out of the enlarged and exquisitely integrated modern concepts of cosmic truth, universe beauty, and divine goodness. Such a new and righteous vision of morality will attract all that is good in the mind of man and challenge that which is best in the human soul._” ([UB 2:7.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p7_10))

Because Jesus is its central figure, _The URANTIA Book_ will be judged by its effect upon Christians; the behavior of Christians towards one another is likely to be the sole factor that can catalyse a transformation among non-Christians.

Perhaps the reference in _The URANTIA Book_ to a second John the Baptist is figurative and really represents that group of individuals who will prepare the way for the book by first reviving the true gospel of the kingdom. The book itself sets us a very limited objective:

> “_The ultimate goal of human progress is the reverent recognition of the Fatherhood of God and the loving materialization of the brotherhood of man._” ([UB 143:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p1_4))

## On Reflection

### On The Early Christians

_from “The Religions of Man”, by Huston Smith_

The people in the streets who first heard Jesus' disciples proclaiming the Good News were as impressed by what they saw as by what they heard. They saw lives that had been transformed — men and women ordinary in every way except for the fact that they seemed to have found the secret of living. They evidenced a tranquility, simplicity, and cheerfulness that their hearers had nowhere else encountered.

Specifically there seemed to be two qualities in which their lives abounded. The first of these was mutual affection. One of the earliest observations about Christians that we have from outsiders was, “See how these Christians love one another.”

Just before his crucifixion, Jesus told his disciples, “My joy I leave with you.” This joy was the second quality that pervaded the lives of the early Christians. Outsiders found this baffling. These Christians were not wealthy or powerful. If anything, they faced more adversity than the average man or woman, yet in the midst of their trials they had laid hold of an inner peace that found expression in a joy that was almost boisterous. Perhaps radiant would be a more exact word, but radiance is hardly the word we would use to characterize the average religious life. The joy of these early Christians was unspeakable — life for them had ceased to be a problem to be solved and had become a glory discerned.

What produced this love and joy in these early Christians? The explanation, in so far as we have been able to gather it from the New Testament records is that three intolerable burdens had been lifted from them. The first of these was fear, even the fear of death. The second was release from guilt. The third was release from the cramping confines of the ego. They knew, in the words of a contemporary poet, “the human curse is to love, sometimes to love well, but never to love well enough.” Now this curse had been dramatically lifted, and in the concept that “it is no longer I that liveth but Christ that liveth in me”, the circle of self was broken, leaving love to flow from its former, self-demanding constraints.

How did the Christians get free of these burdens? And what did a man named Jesus, now gone, have to do with the process that they should credit it as his achievement? The only power that can effect transformations of the order we have described is love.

It remained for our generation to discover that locked within the atom is the energy of the sun itself. For this energy to be released, however, the atom must be bombarded from without. So, too, there is locked in every human life, a wealth of love and joy that partakes of God himself, and it too can be released only through external bombardment, in this case the bombardment of love.

If we, too, really felt loved, not abstractly or in principle but vividly and personally, by one who united in himself all power and perfection, the experience could melt our fear, guilt, and self-concern forever. As Kierkegaarde says, “if at every moment, both present and future, it were eternally certain that nothing has happened or can ever happen, not even the most fearful horror invented by the most morbid imagination and translated into fact, which can separate us from God's love, here would be the reason for joy.”

This love of God is precisely what the first Christians did feel. They became convinced that Jesus was God and they felt directly the force of his love. Once it reached them it could not be stopped. Melting the barriers of fear, guilt, and self, it poured through them as if they were sluice gates, expanding the love they had hitherto felt for others until the difference in degree became a difference in kind and quality which their world called Christian love. The apostle Paul described this love for the very first time in a letter to the Christian community in Corinth:

> “_Love is patient and kind, love is not jealous or boastful; it is not arrogant or rude. Love does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrong, but rejoices in the right. Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends..._” ([1 Cor. 4-8](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/4))

So astonishing did the first Christians find this love and the fact that it had actually entered their lives, they had to appeal for help in describing it. Paul, in closing one of the earliest recorded sermons on the Good News, turned back to the words of one of the prophets: “Look at this you scornful souls and lose yourselves in wonder, for in your days I do such a deed that, if men were to tell you this story, you would not believe it.”

> “_True, a marvelous manifestation of brotherly love and unexampled goodwill did spring up in these early communities of believers... they were filled with joy and they lived such new and unique lives that all men were attracted to their teaching about Jesus._” ([UB 194:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_6))

## When All Is Said And Done

“One of the most important things in human living is to find out what Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement of his exalted life purpose. Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it ” (2090.5)

My best wishes and greetings to all Urantian and non-Urantian friends in Australia.

I have always looked forward to receiving my copy of Six-O-Six and every one is filled with news, ideas, thoughts, quotes, and people's views. But most of all, it is the spark that triggers my mind to take off in the direction of _The URANTIA Book_. This is the basis of Six-O-Six. And by the way, Congratulations!

**All of us at Six-O-Six thank you for your kind comments and well wishes. It will be a pleasure to keep 'em coming:**
