## Editor's Notebook

An interesting topic currently generating comment relates to the subject of channeling. Articles in this issue present a range of views on this matter. In addition, there is an item or two on book distribution, although the Foundation's policy has not been specifically addressed.

All this, plus our usual features. We hope our continuing diverse collection of information assists in the understanding of fellow readers.

Now for a few words lightheartedly dedicated to those selfless people who have contributed, so often unintentionally, to the revelation.

Our simple ideas, our dearest dreams, win small gains and endure spectacular losses. For each and every occasion, our dear friends, God bless them, offer their god-like objectivity and insight. Often, they too, are hapless victims in our cause.

But they hang in there for us, realizing there was no real solution and no criteria for success. At least that opinion serves us well as our survival technique.

Surely that aspirant appreciated our one-hour explanation about the third mansion world! And what — about those sentences we knew by heart and finished off with the page number just for good measure. Their childlike faith did not buy our power of reason, our pearls of revelation, our expectations. Unnoticed by us, their suspicion of our quest was already changing to certainty. Their loss of course. Our approach was so reasonable, so gentle. Oh well, they obviously weren't ready!

Then we move to the take-it-or-leave-it approach. Enough of those lengthy explanations, the carefully selected brochure. Just give 'em the book. Cop that!

See, they're not ready either!

With a little patience, and lots of different dissemination techniques, we can have confused people everywhere. It's lots of fun. Swap stories with colleagues. It's like God has given us creative control over the spiritual destiny of a whole planet.

By comparison, being CEO at Time magazine would bc a little mundane, don't you think?

The best part is being only accountable to God. Now who can argue with that? No shareholders, no losses. No worries, sport!

Now, here are some very important tips:

* Never smile. Leave people to ponder on your seriousness.
* Seem absent-minded, the sign of greater awareness and higher contact.
* Never be stuck for an answer. Act like you always know whereof you speak.
* Be articulate. Be able to out-manoeuvre your own subconscious.
* Leave meetings early. Wear the latest joggers for a fast get-away.
* Always leave your book at home. Borrow, and make someone feel important.

In honour of us poor souls saving this planet, we need a book to rescue us, to overcome our unhappy lot. Perhaps research could be done on Les Miserables, The Revolt of the Masses, and Dicken's Hard Times. There, I feel better already.

I have to go now. Turn on my answering machine with the UB message, put my feet up, and learn a few more lines from the book. I've got another big day tomorrow.

Hey, by the way! What's the best way to remember those flamin' page numbers?

## So They Say

**Environment Magazine**

[With] The increasingly international nature of environmental problems... one nation's problem is, in fact, every nation's problem. The traditional notion of national sovereignty has been severely challenged and is being transformed.

**Professor Goodman, Murdoch University**

Australia needed to refine social science theory which is woefully inadequate for dealing with change in East Asia. The existing concepts are all based on Western European experience.

**University Of Queensland Contact Magazine**

New areas of study derive from new discoveries and knowledge. Consequently, a university that wishes to provide a curriculum that maintains currency for undergraduates cannot rely on elderly administrators who haven't taught or researched for many years, and certainly it cannot rely on government bureaucrats.

**Nobel laureate, Eugene Wigner**

The concepts of mathematics are not chosen for their conceptual simplicity...but for their amenability to clever manipulations and to striking, brilliant arguments.

## Crafts Magazine

According to Plato, the question of whether art is of value is the question of whether it has any clear relationship to knowledge. Plato concludes that art has a little to do with knowledge, but very little and accordingly he assigns it a rather minor place in his conception of the best possible State.

## Letters To The Editor

### The Fellowship International Conference

_St Hyacinthe, Canada, July/August 1993_

It is the plan of the Canadian organizers of the conference that 30% of the presenters should come from outside of the United States.

No doubt many of these 30% will be Canadians. However, the organizers want to hear from readers who plan to attend the conference in the hope that some of them would be prepared to make a presentation.

Apparently the facilities at St. Hyacinthe are first class, and very versatile, so that a great range of different types of presentation can be scheduled. The organizers plan a strong emphasis on small groups.

If any Australian or New Zealand reader who plans to attend the conference would like to make a presentation, or participate in the program in some way, please contact either:

_Sue Tennant_

or

_“Elmgrove”_
_Towamba, NSW 2550, Australia_

### Photos Sought

Dear Readers of Six-O-Six,

We are in the process of processing the third issue of the Study Group Herald. I am therefore requesting further that you send black and white photos or negatives of your study groups or yourselves with the names of the people on the photos at the back as soon as possible to:

_P.O. Box 692, Montery, MA, 01245, USA_

### Broad Perspective

_Geoff Lund, Runaway Bay, Qld_

In 1990, while in the United Kingdom, I picked up some books on religious topics, such as ‘Encyclopaedia of World Religions’, published in the 19th century, and one entitled ‘The Myth of Christian Uniqueness’, and they have been most informative.

I find most religious journals push their own line only and are not interested in discussion of wider religious thought, although there may be one or two in the USA encouraging that line. I do feel there is a great searching, particularly in the Western world, for some faith that will bring brotherly love between peoples.

## News Around The World

### Local Office

The Urantia Foundation advises it now has an office in Australia. It is to provide copies of _The URANTIA Book_ and other Foundation materials to individuals and bookstores throughout the Southwest Pacific.

So that bookstores know that they can order books direct, _The URANTIA Book_ has been listed in Australian Books in Print.

For individuals, up to three books per year may be purchased at a 40% discount from the suggested retail price of $55 Australian (plus shipping and handling).

This policy has been implemented to encourage purchases from bookstores. In this way it is expected that the book will become available to a wider readership.

Further enquiries and orders can be addressed to:

_Urantia Foundation_
_7 Walsh St. North Narrabeen N.S.W. 2101,_
_Australia, Telephone/Fax: (02) 9706200_

### Museum Open

The Jerusalem Bible Lands Museum is now open. Mosaics, sarcophagi, terra cotta figurines from Syria, jewellery from ancient Egypt, Phoenician ivory inlays, Sumerian seals, and countless other objects reveal the ancient world, the cradle of our civilization.

It is largely the collection of Dr Elie Borowski, who gathered the pieces over 45 years. Of his museum, Dr Borowski says: “The focus is on the Bible, the moral and spiritual source of Western Civilization.”

### Channel Of A Different Sort

An Open Learning Project, based on a British concept, is being run by ABC television in Australia.

These degree courses are directed at mature age students, and students who have missed out on University acceptance.

Initial response has been strong, particularly from rural and regional areas.

The preference has not been for the usual courses of statistics and marketing. Interest has been directed to French, Australian studies, and comparative religion.

Demand and Government support are in place. Availability of overseas programs, new course production, and textbooks are in short supply.

### New Zealand Connection

Book readers in New Zealand have requested affiliation with The Australian Association of Students of _The URANTIA Book_ (AASUB).

Such a move would provide an expanded network of reader contacts, encourage additional study groups, and address the wider issue of book availability in New Zealand libraries and bookstores.

### Court Case

In the court case against Kristen Maaherra, the Foundation has successfully delayed bringing it before the court on the grounds of a conflict of interest by the defence lawyers. It appears that a now-deceased lawyer who once worked for the Foundation had an informal conversation with a member of the law firm representing Kristen Maaherra. Her lawyers did their standard search before accepting her case and found no conflict. However it seems that the court case could be delayed for possibly a further six months. It also appears to be true that the Foundation cannot voluntarily withdraw.

### Cosmology '92

_By Eric J. Lemer, from ‘Sky and Telescope’, Feb. 1992_

The Big Bang predicts that the universe is homogeneous on the largest scale, but astronomers have discovered vast conglomerates of galaxies stretching across billions of light years. Given the known velocity of galaxies today, it would have taken at least 60 billion years by any process to form these structures (the age of the Big Bang universe as derived from the Hubble relation is less than 20 billion years).

Isotropic blackbody background radiation has been cited as the greatest confirmation of the Big Bang. This requires an inflationary universe and a density of matter 50 to 100 times larger than observed. So ‘dark matter’ was invented. However if the large scale structures now observed had that the density dark matter theories predict, the galaxies would be flying around at speeds 10 times higher than observed.

New results by Fuller and colleagues show that there is less helium than the Big Bang calls for, and estimates for deuterium and lithium are out by a factor of ten.

An alternative theory that describes a virtually infinite universe filled with plasma and shaped by electricity and magnetism as well as gravity is receiving growing support. Theorists say that there are plasma explanations for the Hubble relation as compelling or more so than the Big Bang's. The Wolf Effect in which resonant frequencies interact to cause wave length shifts may account for large red shifts observed from quasars.

[Note: very recent evidence indicates that the isotropic background radiation may not be isotropic after all. Remarkably, after so long being the strongest supporting evidence for the Big Bang, mental gymnastics are now being performed to use the lack of isotropism as also its strongest supporting evidence! And this before the data is even confirmed.]

### Channeling And The Urantia Movement

_by Meredith J. Sprunger_

Psychic or paranormal psychological phenomena variously referred to as extrasensory perception, channeling, spiritualism, mediumship, and activities of the marginal consciousness have been rather common throughout human history. Many years ago I made a study of these paranormal communications and found they varied in quality as widely as the capabilities of the human mind. Some of the psychic communications studied present verifiable factual knowledge for which scientists find no reasonable empirical explanation. The great bulk of this material, however, is demonstrably inaccurate and unreliable.

Since the publication of _The URANTIA Book_, there have been many claims by book readers of “special” channeling information or guidance. Some even claim _The URANTIA Book_ came through a channeling process although the authors of the book deny the spiritual authenticity of channeling-mediumistic psychic phenomena ([UB 77:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_13); [UB 146:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p7_2)). Dr William S. Sadler, leader of the group receiving the Urantia Papers, after listing every conceivable form of psychic phenomena (marginal consciousness), unequivocally declared: “The technique of the reception of _The URANTIA Book_ in English in no way parallels or impinges upon any of the phenomena of the marginal consciousness.”

**Basic Error In Evaluation**

The basic error in evaluating knowledge — especially psychic communication and revelation — is to look for verification in its source, author, claim, or ‘authority’. There is a natural human desire for superior, unearned knowledge; we yearn for surety, a ‘hot line’ to higher guidance. This is the source of fundamentalistic, literalist, dogmatic thinking.

Claim or authority, however, is never a criterion of truth. The only road to truth is through earned, evolutionary, experience. We should always evaluate information by its content, not its claim or supposed source. In our earned experience we have the highest resources to guide and verify our judgment: the Spirit of God (Thought Adjuster), the Spirit of Truth, and the Holy Spirit. Judgments must also always be tested by personal experience, the experience of others, and time.

When measured by these earned, experiential standards over time, the value of channeled communication does not rate very high. We should not, however, allow fear or prejudice to prevent us from honestly and critically examining the content of information received through channeling. We should be open to carefully evaluating all types of knowledge.

**A Specific Case**

Recently I examined recordings of ‘Teachings of Ham’ channeled to the Salt Lake Study Group. I found their general quality good. They are of the quality which I would expect from a creative, intelligent student of _The URANTIA Book_. While, in my judgment, they are not in the same league with _The URANTIA Book_, they are basically constructive and insightful.

There are a number of limitations to the above generalizations. I find no empirical-experiential evidence for the claim that the Lucifer rebellion has been adjudicated and that the system circuits are being opened. I question the truth of the claim of giving people their ‘spiritual’ names. The authors of _The URANTIA Book_ tell us that we are given a new name only after fusion with our Thought Adjuster ([UB 47:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p8_5)). I further question the wisdom of this practice. Why is Rebecca more spiritual than Jan or Joshua more spiritual than Thern? This is the kind of technique used for controlling people through ‘special’ or secret knowledge. Many cults use such practices.

Ham discourages a member of the study group from taking an eight week summer course because he will miss these channeling sessions. Even the higher ranking authors of _The URANTIA Book_ do not use this style of manipulative control. Why would the Vicegerent Planetary Prince single out the Salt Lake Study Group for special attention as they were told? And through this special attention Ham tells them “you are...under...my direction.” Group leadership and direction is a common practice, but I see in this kind of atmosphere the danger of acquiescing to uncritical manipulation.

> We Should Always Evaluate Information By Its Content, Not Its Claim Or supposed source.

Ham tells the group the spiritual center of the planet is Manitoba, Canada. This differs from the Chicago contact information designating it as at the Grizzly Giant in the Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias in Yosemite National Park. When Ham is asked about Norsen, he identifies him as a teacher which is markedly different than the Chicago contact information telling that Norson is the new ‘take charge’ planetary supervisor.

One wonders why people feel a need for channeling guidance which, historically, does not have a very good track record, when they have direct personal contact with much higher sources of truth: their Thought Adjuster, the Spirit of Truth, and the Holy Spirit? It seems to me that the study of _The URANTIA Book_ would be superior to preoccupation with this quality of channeling information. I further see a danger in the possibility of giving the channelor undue respect as an authority figure which might by-pass higher spiritual guidance. When this happens, cults are formed with a susceptibility to manipulative control.

**The Bottom Line**

The content of Ham's teachings is basically constructive and is no doubt helpful to some people. There are also those who have not summoned the courage and confidence to initiate outreach work who will do so when encouraged by channeling messages. At best such channeling activity can be a supplement to URANTIA Book study, guidance, and individual initiative; at worst it could be a substitute for it. We should always critically evaluate the quality of any kind of guidance.

### Channeling And Communication With The Spirit World

_The Sunshine Coast Study Group_

> “_The only means of communion with the spiritual world is embraced in the spirit endowment of mankind, the indwelling spirit of the Father, together with the outpoured spirit of the Son and the omnipresent influence of the Infinite Spirit._” ([UB 150:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p3_7))

The word ‘only’ in this statement is quite unambiguous and must be kept continually in mind. At first sight there look to be three independent spirit sources. However the book states that, “_Regardless of plurality of origin, all spirit influences are one in function._” ([UB 34:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_2)) Only the Thought Adjuster directly contacts the human mind ([UB 34:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_3)).

We need to know what is meant by ‘communion.’ A dictionary definition is “to converse together intimately”. To do that via a third party is usually inhibitory to intimate bilateral fellowship. So can there be any really direct contact with angels and other similar celestial beings? The book says:

> “_Angels do not invade the sanctity of the human mind; they do not manipulate the will of morals; neither do they directly contact with the indwelling Adjusters._” ([UB 113:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_1))

That appears to rule out conversing with our angels. But it does not mean that angels cannot sometimes influence our lives. For example, _The URANTIA Book_ confirms ([UB 77:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_12)), that when the apostles were thrown into prison “an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors and brought them forth.” ([Acts 5:9](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/5#v9))

> “_The intelligence of angels is not directly available to your; they do not seek to influence you; you must chart your own course._” ([UB 113:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_4)).

So what kind of help can they give us?

> “_Seraphim are able to function as material ministers to human beings under certain circumstances, but their action in this capacity is very rare. They are able, with the assistance of the midway creatures and the physical controllers, to function in a wide range of activities in behalf of human beings, even to make actual contact with mankind but such occurrences are very unusual._” ([UB 113:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/113#p5_5)).

In considering the kind of communication humans may have with spiritual forces and celestial beings from beyond our planet, the Book has a very revealing statement:

> “_When a world is isolated by rebellion, when a planet is cut off from all outside encircuited communication, as was Urantia after the Caligastia upheaval, aside from personal messengers there remains but one possibility of direct interplanetary or universe communication, and that is through the liaison of the Adjusters of the spheres._” ([UB 108:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p4_4))

A very widespread activity called channeling in which individuals claim to receive messages from extra-terrestrial sources, has been going on for many, many centuries on our planet — a planet in quarantine! Hence the logical conclusion is that this phenomenon is an aberration of the human mind. Or alternatively, the channel's source is really Caligastia. But for this to occur, the person acting as a channel must really desire to have Caligastia enter into their lives ([UB 53:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_6)).

The book is quite adamant that the only channel to the spiritual world is via our Thought Adjusters. This implies that any spirit beings who reach into our minds by channels other than our Thought Adjusters are not of the spiritual world. However even the Thought Adjuster pathway itself is fraught with the danger of contamination. The book states:

“_During mortal life the material body and mind separate you from your Adjuster and prevent free communication_ ([UB 110:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p7_8));_...it is hazardous to attempt the differentiation of the Adjuster's concept registry from ...the dictations of mortal conscience_ ([UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5)); _Adjusters find it next to impossible to communicate directly with the human mind_ ([UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5)); _more often, in beings of your order, that which you accept as the Adjuster's voice is in reality the emanations of your own intellect_ ([UB 110:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_6)).”

Unless studied carefully, references in _The URANTIA Book_ to the role of contact personalities of the reserve corps of destiny may generate much confusion. The book states:

> “_No matter what happens on a world or in a universe, the Adjusters are never directly concerned. The isolation of a planet in no way affects the Adjusters and their ability to communicate with any part of the local universe, superuniverse, or the central universe. And this is the reason why contacts with the supreme and the self-acting Adjusters of the reserve corps of destiny are so frequently made on quarantined worlds. Recourse is had to such a technique as a means of circunventing the handicaps of planetary isolation._” ([UB 108:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p4_4))

Please note that contact is with the Adjuster, the statement does not include the reservist. What comes into our quarantined planet from the outside requires a special and somewhat fortuitous triad combination of a contact human of the reserve corps, an unusual secondary midwayer with special skills ([UB 114:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_9)), and a supreme and self-acting adjuster. Given this combination, the superhuman planetary administration of our isolated planet is enabled to receive a dribble of information and perhaps some instructions from extra-planetary sources.

> The Book Is Quite Adamant That The Only Channel To The Spiritual World Is via our Thought Adjusters.

The reserve corps of destiny is an emergency group who, for the most part, are unconscious of their preparation for any task in which they become involved. Contact personalities may have some awareness of their training ([UB 114:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_2)). Details about their role in information transfer is largely limited to a few clues from the book and a few particulars about the individual through whom the URANTIA Papers were received. The latter was said to have been a passive participant in the transfer process. Of the other members of the triad, the secondary midwayer appears to play an important role while the Adjuster has the ability to travel and communicate virtually anywhere and everywhere.

The concept that reservists may be on first name terms with beings from the spiritual world appears to be incorrect. During his incarnation in the flesh, and excluding his eleven planetary custodians, not even Machiventa Melchizedek could communicate with celestial personalities. He had no more contact with superhuman intelligences than a normal human being ([UB 93:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/93#p2_8)).

Careful thought reveals just how dangerous and impractical it would be for our planetary supervisors to attempt to intervene in the material affairs of men by issuing orders through human contact personalities. Such interference appears to be contrary to universe policy.

In November 1980, a former Foundation Trustee, Thomas A. Kendall, reported that he was read a ‘message’ said to have been received by and acted upon by the Trustees regarding negotiations with the Weiss family on the French translation of _The URANTIA Book_. Such a ‘message’ would appear to be a contravention of Jesus' stated policy of non-interference in the material affairs of men ([UB 143:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p3_1)). Furthermore this supposed ‘message’ belies a statement by a former Trustee that no more messages were received from the Revelatory Commission subsequent to January 1955 when conditional permission was granted to publish the Urantia Papers. This statement has been corroborated by Dr Sadler. So was the message about the French translation genuine or could it have been an aberration of the human mind? Since _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that the only pathway for communication with the spirit world is via our Thought Adjuster, we must evaluate the validity of all supposed ‘messages’ in the light of this statement:

> “_But a human being would do better to err in rejecting an Adjuster's expression through believing it to be a purely human experience than to blunder into exalting a reaction of the mortal mind to the sphere of divine dignity._” ([UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5))

It makes sense that The Urantia Papers themselves would have contained all the necessary information for the dissemination of its message. Anything else would be liable to corruption by humans, no matter how well intentioned. The book makes it clear that it is universe policy that neither our superhuman planetary supervisors nor celestial beings are normally permitted to tell evolutionary mortal ascenders what they must do. We are expected to make spiritual progress through our own decisions.

> “_Adjusters are interested in, and concerned with, your daily doings and the manifold details of your life just to the extent that these are influential in the determination of your significant temporal choices and vital spiritual decisions and, hence, are factors in the solution of your problem of soul survival and eternal progress. The Adjuster, while passive regarding purely temporal welfare, is divinely active concerning all the affairs of your eternal future._” ([UB 110:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p1_4))

Even the validity of the conditional message referred to which authorized publication of the Urantia Papers must now be treated with scepticism. It is said to have come from one identifying himself as Norson and is reported to have stated: “I am a Melchizedek. I am the Planetary Prince of Urantia. While I am not positive that now is the time to publish these Papers, you may publish them if you receive no further communications from me before the first of October of this year.” This message has a false and familiar ring about it which is remindful of other highly doubtful channeled messages claiming to originate from a Melchizedek.

It has become apparent that right from very early days, many URANTIA Book readers at all levels, have flirted with channeling and similar psychic phenomena. Based directly on the teachings of the book, it is our opinion that most messages, supposedly emanating from superior beings, are simply the mind products of the human participants. However it is well to remember that Caligastia is “_still free on Urantia to prosecute his nefarious designs_” ([UB 53:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_6)), and that channeling and similar psychic practices may be the only effective means by which he can implement his plans. Those who think that they hear voices or are channels to the spirit world should be aware that the book specifically warns that it would be better to reject supposed ‘messages’ than to blunder into mistakingly exalting them to divine status. There is really no way of knowing the difference other than by the effect such messages may ultimately have on the bearing of spiritual fruits. Remember too that the apostle Peter believed that, at Jesus' behest, he walked on water. The book tells us he did not.

### Channeling And Mental Disorder

_by Ann Bendall and Ken Glasziou, Queensland [Ann's expertise is in psychology; Ken's in biochemistry]_

Professor A.C.P. Sims is a well-known authority on the subject of mental disorders, including schizophrenia. In his book, ‘Symptoms in Man’s Mind', he writes, “The religious nature of the delusion is seen as a disorder of content... So religious delusions are not caused by excessive religious belief... but they simply accentuate that when a person becomes mentally ill his delusions reflect, in their content, his predominant interests and concerns.”

M.V. Dunlop is a well-known Christian author who has written extensively on the subject of contemplative meditation as a means of training our minds to live continuously in the presence of Jesus. He makes these two statements, “Sooner or later our mental states are bound to reflect that on which we keep our attention,” and, “our minds take their quality from that on which we dwell.” His system of meditation aims to help us on our way to obeying Jesus' command, “Be ye therefore perfect as your Father in heaven is perfect.” (Matt. 5:48; U.B. 1574:4)

In the light of Professor Sim's observations it is well to beware of the possible harm that may arise from excessive or obsessional preoccupation with a narrow set of interests. Remember that _The URANTIA Book_ describes Jesus in this way:

> “_The all-consuming and indomitable spiritual faith of Jesus never became fanatical, for it never attempted to run away with his well-balanced intellectual judgments concerning the proportional values of practical and commonplace social, economic, and moral life situations. The Son of Man was a splendidly unified human personality; he was a perfectly endowed divine being; he was also magnificently co-ordinated as a combined human and divine being functioning on earth as a single personality. Always did the Master co-ordinate the faith of the soul with the wisdom-appraisals of seasoned experience. Personal faith, spiritual hope, and moral devotion were always correlated in a matchless religious unity of harmonious association with the keen realization of the reality and sacredness of all human loyalties — personal honor, family love, religious obligation, social duty, and economic necessity._” ([UB 196:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_7))

The gradation between the ‘normal’ mental state and the more extreme states such as schizophrenia is continuous. Probably nobody is completely ‘normal’ and few are totally mad.

Given the appropriate environmental, physiological and psychological conditions, most of us are capable of acting in an irrational way and can be pushed to the borderline and beyond of mental disability. Usually, it is only when we become severely socially dysfunctional that we get a label such as paranoid, manic, schizophrenic, etc.

It is an established fact that many kinds of psychotic disturbances, including schizophrenia, can be simulated using drugs known to interact with the electrochemistry of the brain, and specifically with the complex system of neurotransmission of electrical impulses across the nerve synapses regulated by substances such as dopamine, serotonin, gamma aminobutyric acid, etc. Schizophrenia is believed to be a disorder of this system and can be treated with drugs such as chlorpromazine that act at the level of the neurotransmitters.

Professor Sims uses the term ‘communicated insanity’ to describe the transfer of psychotic behaviour from a deluded person (the Principal) to ‘Associates’ who come to share false beliefs. In one such relationship (folie impose), separation from the Principal is often followed by remission of symptoms in the Associates. Sims also states that it cannot be stressed too often that patients believe their delusions literally, and that such delusions differ from mere fantasy. The reality of the delusion is ‘known’ with unconcerned certainty.

What we call channeling is not a new phenomenon and is found among the inmates of mental institutions where patients ‘hear’ voices that they may ascribe to God himself, extraterrestrials, celestial beings of many kinds, and disembodied spirits.

When ‘channeling’ is a delusion of the mind induced by malfunctioning electrochemistry, at present the only immediately effective treatment appears to be with appropriate drugs. However, even in some quite severe cases, remission does occur spontaneously.

A great danger associated with ‘channeling’ is when the channel has a charismatic personality combined with acting, oratorical, and organizational skills in which case communicated insanity may become a very real problem in that such people may have a profound and harmful influence on their followers.

A well known example is the case of the Reverend Jones who, claiming to be instructed by God, induced hundreds of associates to indulge in murder and suicide. Because of the dangers involved, and since _The URANTIA Book_ advocates a one-to-one relationship with both our Thought Adjuster and Jesus' Spirit of Truth, it is highly questionable that one should ever divert attention to lesser beings for our guidance.

### Midwayer Communications

_Excerpts from “ A Report on Channeling in the Urantia Community” by Ernest Moyer_

> “_But it should be made clear that the midway creatures are not involved in the sordid performances taking place under the general designation of ‘spiritualism’_”. ([UB 77:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_13))

There it is! A concrete and specific statement about spiritualism, about mediumship, and about channeling. Midway creatures are not involved in such sordid performances. They do not invade the sanctity of the human mind; they do not offer spirit communications; they do not mislead poor misguided human mortals; they do not desecrate the dignity of human personality. They do not provide channelings, or any other form of mediumship falling under the general designation of Spiritualism.

How did some Urantians get into the belief that channeling was an authorized technique of communication?

The notion is based partly on the tradition that _The URANTIA Book_ was channeled, and partly on statements within _The URANTIA Book_.

When Sadler wrote ‘The Mind at Mischief’ he discussed an individual who produced ‘revelations’ both through ‘automatic’ writing and ‘automatic’ speaking. These revelations, as described by Sadler, contained material which had close parallels with the material we now find in _The URANTIA Book_. Therefore, everyone concludes that the Book was channeled. Was it not?

Sadler's rejection of channeling as the mechanism for the transfer of _The URANTIA Book_ was clearly indicated to a group of ministers brought together by Meredith Sprunger in May of 1958. Although he would not say how _The URANTIA Book_ was given, he was willing to say how it was not given. His list included automatic writing, automatic talking, automatic hearing, automatic seeing, and other automatic phenomena. As a result of his meeting with the ministers, he wrote a paper entitled, ‘Consideration of Criticism of _The URANTIA Book_.’ In that paper he made several important remarks.

“No living person fully understands just how the URANTIA papers got translated into the English manuscript which was authorized for publication.” (p.9)

Here it is evident that he distinguishes that “manuscript which was authorized for publication.” This was different from the papers previously given to the Forum.

>“_I can testify that the URANTIA Papers were not the product of automatic writing or any other technique of psychic legerdemain known to me._” (p.13)

Here Sadler is explicit that _The URANTIA Book_ did not come through automatic writing or automatic speaking. After listing all the automatic methods by which _The URANTIA Book_ did not come, he states explicitly that the reception of the Book had no parallels with any of the phenomena of marginal consciousness. Nor did the technique of reception impinge upon any of the phenomena of marginal concsciousness. This eliminates the sleeping subject as the source of _The URANTIA Book_.

But there are other factors to midwayer communications and activities which have served to confuse the general readership and more serious students of _The URANTIA Book_.

The midwayers serve as guardians when the Thought Adjuster is absent, for those human mortals who are members of the reserve corps of destiny. The midwayers do not manipulate the mind during these periods, nor do they transgress the will or the dignity of personality of those human mortals.

We do not know from fact the nefarious designs of Caligastia. but we can surmise, and we can use our heads to come to some fairly certain conclusions.. He can enter the minds of human mortals and can draw near to their souls to tempt and corrupt them — if they wish to be cursed by his wicked presence. They probably do not go around saying, “Caligastia, I wish you would enter my mind.” But they do go around saying, “Spirit Intelligence, I wish you would communicate in my mind. I wish you would channel with me so I can tell my compatriots the secrets of the ages.” That most certainly is done everywhere, a thousand times a day.

Even more, the Thought Adjuster must depart for ‘Spirit Intelligence’ to come into the human mind. Thus it is clear that the Thought Adjuster, and hence God, knows the heart of the human mortal. God knows that such individuals are not centered on him, but rather have their hearts centered on such wicked deeds. Furthermore, those individuals cannot be members of the reserve corps of destiny. If they were members the midwayers would serve as contact guardians during the period when the Thought Adjuster is absent, to prevent ‘Spirit Intelligence’ from entering.

From a review of passages from _The URANTIA Book_, we can reach a deeper appreciation why ‘Spirit Intelligence’ would not pretend to be a midwayer.

## The Bookstudy And Discussion

### Spreading The Massage

_Brisbane Study Group_

How do we spread the message of _The URANTIA Book_? Good question. There was a time when many of us thought that we could rely upon instructions said to have been given to the human members of the Revelatory Commission. Presently there is considerable doubt about the validity of some of these supposed instructions. This may be a good thing, for it makes sense that the book itself should contain all the instructions necessary for its own dissemination. And at least we know that what we find in the book is authoritative. The following statement by the Master himself is both challenging and somewhat bothersome.

> “_Let me emphatically state this eternal truth: If you, by truth co-ordination, learn to exemplify in your lives this beautiful wholeness of righteousness, your fellow men will then seek after you that they may gain what you have so acquired. The measure wherewith truth seekers are drawn to you represents the measure of your truth endowment, your righteousness. The extent to which you have to go with your message to the people is, in a way, the measure of your failure to live the whole or righteous life, the truth co-ordinated life._” ([UB 155:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_5))

The extent to which we have to take the message to the people is the measure of our failure! Speaking about the earliest Christian community, the book says: “_Nevertheless they were filled with joy, and they lived such new and unique lives that all men were attracted to their teachings about Jesus._” ([UB 194:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p4_6)) It was the joy and the unique lives of these people and not the written word that drew attention to the teachings of Jesus.

Professor Huston Smith, in his book ‘The Religions of Man’, tells us that one of the earliest written observations from an outsider about these early Christians was, “See how these Christians love one another”. Smith says that there were two qualities that distinguished them, one a tranquility, simplicity, and cheerfulness that their hearers encountered nowhere else; the second, a joy that pervaded their lives. Outsiders found this baffling because most of them faced much greater than average adversity. Yet in all of their trials they laid hold of an inner peace that found expression in a joy that was almost boisterous. Perhaps radiant would be a better word, Smith says, though St. Paul himself described this joy as intoxicating.

Professor John Hicks has described the remarkable fortitude of early Christian martyrs. He quotes from a second century document, ‘The Martyrdom of Polycarp’ which says of certain Christian martyrs of that time, “they reached such a pitch of magnanimity that not one of them let a sigh or a groan escape them.” Professor Hicks also describes the martyrdom of a noblewoman named Perpetua who behaved as if in a trance whilst being gored to death in the arena by a bull, not appearing to realize even that she was being hurt. Among the early Christians, martyrdom was considered to confer an immediate, oneway ticket to heaven and some even sought martyrdom.

> These and many other observations indicate that our inner attitude can exercise a powerful and transformative effect upon how we interpret suffering and misfortune.

Dr H.K. Beecher, reporting observations made during the Second World War, says that severe wounds were sometimes construed as a good thing if the wounding meant release from an intolerable situation. In particular, he describes the reactions of wounded men at Anzio during the Allied invasion of Italy where troops were pinned down for a long period by a frightful German bombardment. Only one quarter of the severely wounded men, having had no analgesics for at least four hours, and none at all in many cases, wanted anything done about it!

These and many other observations indicate that our inner attitude can exercise a powerful and transformative effect upon how we interpret suffering and misfortune. Huston Smith also tells us that there can be little doubt that the joy seen among the early Christians was a reaction to their release from three intolerable burdens firstly the fear of death itself, secondly, release from the burden of guilt, and thirdly, release from the cramping confines of the ego.

_The URANTIA Book_ brings us the message that we are all indwelt by the Spirit of a Father-God who loves us, whose intent is that not one of his beloved children should be lost. For the asking, we all have an exciting universe career open to us in which we will ultimately be ushered into the very presence of the Father himself, then into the Corps of Finality from where we will be launched upon an everlasting and exalting adventure of service and discovery. None of us need miss out on achieving these goals; we can only do so by preferring self-destruction through the wholehearted embracing of iniquity. Even then we must approve of our own fate (615:5).

Surely this 20th century version of the ‘good news’ should impact upon us at least as much as the first century gospel impacted upon the early Christians. And if it does so, should it not evoke the same kind of joy and cause the same remarkable spread of the Fifth Epochal Revelation as it did for the Fourth Epochal Revelation during the first 100 years of Christendom? To date, this is not apparent. Perhaps we are missing the point somewhere.

### Are You Ready For _The Urantia Book_?

_Jim Mcnelly (From An Article In The Brotherhood Of Man Library)_

During periods of darkness when tyrants cast a pall of authoritarianism over the world, it never fails that dedicated bands of volunteers appear unexpectedly to pick up the banner of light when truth and righteousness might otherwise flicker or fade.

Past revelations are filled with testimonies of individuals carrying on when ordained teachers and leaders failed or became timid, missing the opportunities of the ages. Van and Amadon stood tall following the fall of the Prince and remained steadfast for over one hundred thousand years. Adamson carried on when the Garden was no more. David Zebedee gathered a band of workers when others sought only to be served. Steven stepped forward and paid the price as Peter sought to devolve Jesus' teachings into a minor subsect of Judaism. Paul's eyes were opened and, with teachings that worked, turned the Roman world upside down.

Look at what is happening. The sales agreement with the Brotherhood has been cancelled. None of the staff trained in book distribution are left at 533. Less than 5\% of the former Brotherhood has stayed with the Foundation.

It will be years before the Fellowship gathers the scattered Brotherhood into a new sovereign order, capable of undertaking the forbidden book dissemination mission. It is unlikely that the Fellowship will soon regain its sales agency trust. The work of reorganizing the Fellowship will take years, if not decades. These are times that call for extraordinary undertakings.

With no organization left, or on the horizon, dedicated to the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_, the Blue Rangers have appeared suddenly and anonymously to fulfil the lost mission — to let people know that _The URANTIA Book_ exists and where to find it. The Blue Rangers are a volunteer task force of individuals dedicated to fostering the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_. It is not the goal of the Rangers to change the Foundation, Fellowship, societies, study groups, or other organizations — each has its own task in the work of the harvest.

Rangers think globally, but act locally. There is nothing to join; no dues to pay. One becomes a Ranger by taking action — by letting people know that _The URANTIA Book_ exists and where to find it.

“Are you ready for _The URANTIA Book_?” is their current theme, a campaign that dares to let individuals make up their own minds concerning the contact of extraterrestrials with our world. No interpreters of the teachings, no proponents of an organization, no defenders of tradition, the autonomous Rangers work on their own, knowing they are carrying on the work of the unheralded ones who came before and will come after. Rangers let others determine for themselves whether or not they are ready for the Great Revelation.

The job of the Rangers is simple: Let people know that _The URANTIA Book_ exists and where to find it. The technique is clear: Tell everyone. Spread the word one on one or in groups any way you can. Go on television and on the radio. Talk to any group that will listen. Don't wait to be nominated by a committee, create your own speakers' bureau! The tools are common. Wear buttons. Put up posters. Pass out literature. Place stickers. Write letters to the editor. Rangers print their own posters, brochures, and other aids.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia" alt="cartoon">
<img src="/image/article/606/cartoon10.jpg">
</figure>

Keep the message of the Rangers simple: The Book exists and this is how to get it. Introduce people to God and the teachings in your non-Ranger activities. The most simple action of a Ranger is to place posters in a public place that reads: “Are you ready for _The URANTIA Book_? Call 312-525-3319 or write: _The URANTIA Book_, 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago Il. 60614.” If a local bookstore is able and willing to buy direct, support them by listing the store location as well as the Foundation.

Join the Rangers in working on the demand side of the revelation. There is little point in getting _The URANTIA Book_ into bookstores if there is no curiosity and love of adventure stimulating people to come in and look for it! “Are you ready for _The URANTIA Book_?” is an effective campaign and technique for getting people to ask the most basic questions, “What is it? Am I ready for it? How can I get one?” Once the potential readers have asked these questions on their own, the work of the Ranger moves on. Remember, the authors of the book have already determined that the world is ready for it. We have been the ones holding back!

## On Reflection

### The Importance Of The Individual

_by Ann Bendall, Nambour, Queensland_

> “_The apostles early learned that the Master had a profound respect and sympathetic regard for every human being he met, and they were tremendously impressed by this uniform and unvarying consideration which he so consistently gave to all sorts of men, women and children. He would pause in the midst of a profound discourse that he might go out in the road to speak good cheer to a passing woman laden with her burden of body and soul. He would interrupt a serious conference with his apostles to fraternize with an intruding child. Nothing ever seemed so important to Jesus as the individual human who chanced to be in his immediate presence. He was master and teacher, but he was more — he was also a friend and neighbor, an understanding comrade._” ([UB 138:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/138#p8_9))

A few pages later (UB 139:5.7), Philip, who had the habit of interrupting Jesus with foolish questions, while he was in the midst of discourse with the apostles, was never reprimanded because:

> “_After all, Jesus was really more interested in Philip's foolish questions than the sermon he might be preaching. Jesus was supremely interested in men, all kinds of men_”. [UB 139:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p5_7)

As a child, I delighted in the future dream of the numbers game — the entertaining of crowds, with hundreds understanding the wealth of strength and love enshrouding them, if only they could see with eyes similar to mine. I did not want to roll up to the pearly gates with credits for x$ number of souls saved, I wanted to arrive there with the whole gang. My ambition was in relation to the mass. By the time I was blessed with _The URANTIA Book_ I had become somewhat disillusioned. My stumbling block to the fulfillment of my dream was the very individuals I was striving to ‘save’. The wretches appeared to be cursed with free will which successfully blocked my genuine, albeit disrespectful, ambitions for them. What a joy, at last, to get to know Jesus and to discover that, in wanting me to follow him, “_Jesus was interested only in the individual, not the mass_”. ([UB 140:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_11))

Where did this idea of the masses develop in my mind? I suspect it came as a result of my formal religious upbringing plus my love of people, and my desire to share that which I was blessed with. My lack of wisdom stemmed from the fact that I underestimated the importance of the individual. He/she was lost in the crowd of my desire. Perhaps in a similar way, most religious organizations have played the numbers game. Statistics quote of the number attending services, the new converts or the loss of attendees. We seem all so interested in quantity rather than quality. 

> All that is asked of us is to value, love, understand and listen to that person.

With most religious organizations, it appears that the number of adherents symbolizes the potency of the religion expounded. And so we are anxious to get millions of URANTIA Books on domestic book shelves. It makes us feel good. We have done our bit for the revelation. Have we?

In our enthusiastic zeal have we offered the book to a person who has approached us like Philip, asking a foolish question? Have we loaded a sister, already heavy laden with her burden of body and soul, with another few pounds? Do we lack such confidence in Jesus Michael's Spirit of Truth, that we cannot entrust him to guide us in the appropriate words of comfort and good cheer? Do we question our ability to assimilate the teachings of The Blue Book into our being so as to give of our religious knowledge, liberally interspersed with loving understanding of the individual who is currently in our presence? Do we question the great power of that person's Thought Adjuster to transform them?

All that is asked of us is to value, love, understand and listen to that person. The confidence we can engender, providing we hold them in the same regard as Jesus does, could remove from their mind and heart the blocks of fear, anxiety and distrust thus providing an uncluttered channel through which their Thought Adjuster can contact their mind.

If we believe enough in our brothers and sisters, if we learn to love them with wisdom and understanding, then just maybe they will dare to believe enough in themselves that they will hear and know how very much loved they are by the “still small voice” of our Father.
