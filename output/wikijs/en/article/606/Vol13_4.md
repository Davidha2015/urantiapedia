## Editor's Notebook

It seems to me that the truly serious students of _The URANTIA Book_ are displaying exceptional tolerance towards those who are dabbling in the activity of channelling.

Call it what you will. Claim to have a contact personality in your group, get excited over the information received, then ponder your new position in the scheme of things.

But let's take a close look at the response to the practice.

Instead of seriously questioning it, are we soft-pedalling to appease some erstwhile friends? Because we think it might be true?

It's a sham, a misdirection of energies, a great disrespect to an epochal revelation. It contravenes all we are taught. To over-rule the book would claim to have access to a higher authority.

Which group, then, is laying claim to be the deliverer of the sixth epochal revelation? Already so soon! The fifth supposedly obsolete!

How many people are now ‘making the switch’ to this practice? They should realize that there are many others who continue to be part of a sane and sensible readership, who have staunchly chosen to ignore such bewildered souls.

Are any members of our URANTIA Book organizational groups prepared to speak up and say ‘yes, we are guided in our decision making by communicated information’? Give it credence and you give yourselves discredit. You would be surrendering your God-given free will and unswervingly heading for mediocrity.

You would be dependent on a single hurian intellect operating on a nonsensical subconscious, on whims, and on so called ‘impressions’. You will ignore the mood of nations, other groups and individuals. Ego-centric and circumspect, you will each reinforce your own insecurities, inadequacies, and irresponsibilities.

Don't even consider this phenomenon. Just ignore it and read the book. Channelers are merely attempting to recycle it. The more conversant the channeller with the book, the more impressive will be the teachings relayed.

Depend solely on your own spiritual worth. Dare to depend solely on Jesus' teachings, as spelt out in great detail in _The URANTIA Book_. Remember? Dare to challenge nonsensical information. Think carefully and independently.

We do not have the excuse of ignorance.

Recognize the symptoms. Inner group elitism, obsessive behaviour, indiscriminate use of funds, the spurning of once-dear friends, uncharacteristic behavioural outbursts, the chosen people syndrome, the save the world justification, irrational decision making, and controlled environments and attitudes. Controlled minds!

Doesn't _The URANTIA Book_ quite deliberately and unequivocally discredit such performances? Who among us can substantiate this misguided practice of channelling from information presented in the fifth epochal revelation to this planet?

## So They Say

**Business Strategy International**

Now that everyone has awakened from the enterprise dream of the 80 's, a different executive style is being peddled for the new decade. 90 's leaders will need to be rounder human beings who are into personal growth, be genuine world citizens with cultural sensitivity, be able to live with adversity and ambiguity, generate momentum, and look to internal sources of self-esteem.

**The Weekend Australian**

Since the laws of physics — even those which govern unpredictable chaos — are written in formal mathematics, this sad fact leaves most of us bereft, deaf to the thunderous music of the expanding cosmos, blind to its truest hues and patterns, numb to the inner world's sensuous touch.

**P.P. McGuinness, Los Angeles**

The one fact that struck me powerfully, which I have not seen in any report, was the omnipresence of religion. In the main stretch of Vermont Avenue, roughly from 51st Street to 87th, I counted more than 100 different churches before I gave up. Most were just large and small store front operations.

**B.A. Santamaria**

There is a deep gulf between a sensible demand for measures calculated to maintain the biological health of soil, air, water and the re- emergence of the ancient pagan cult of pantheism, which the environmental cult is increasingly becoming. The impetus behind the new cult is the powerful political force mobilised by the various environmental advocacy movements, which in the US alone, have some 50,000 full-time employees.

## Letters To The Editor

### Introductory Readings From The Us

_David Glass, Fort Worth, Texas, USA_

“The Love of the Universal Father” is the transcript of a speech I gave at the recent Cedar Hill Conference (near Dallas) for Readers of _The URANTIA Book_, the theme of which was ‘Live in My Love’.

‘How Do We Get to Heaven?’ is an attempt to restate some of the knowledge and understanding we have received from the revelators on this subject. It is designed to provide readers with something to share with other people who do not intend to read the revelation. It is also useful to readers as a compilation of facts about the survival process which I hope will be helpful.

‘The Resurrection of My Soul’ is a poetic way of describing the resurrection experience. Except for a few words newly coined by the revelators, this poem can also be shared with non-readers.I hope these items will provide pleasurable reading and intuitive, spiritual insight.

### Paperback Edition?

_Keith Bacon, Frankston, Victoria_

1900 years ago, Jesus presented Urantia with his personal saving message and gospel, putting Michael's words to our Father's divine love.

Now this same master — Jesus — has re-presented his very same saving message to us in _The URANTIA Book_. This second attempt to present his matchless gospel should be available to all humanity through translation and printing. It needs to be presented, unencumbered by the rest of _The URANTIA Book_, in a free paperback in every language to all people with an advertised option to purchase the whole book after reading the Master's teachings in a gift from a mate.

### Invitation From Amsterdam

_John Blogg, Amsterdam, The Netherlands_

I am the caretaker of PO Box of _The URANTIA Book_ Readers of Amsterdam. It is good to hear from you so far away. I will certainly copy [Tony Rudd's] tape and send it to fellow brothers. I do write with readers in the USA now and then. I enjoyed your tape!

For a long time now I have been into synergy — Buckminster Fuller and dome building — and in May I leave for LaPalma, Canary Islands, to look for a site to build one. I hope to hear more from you or other Australian readers.

## News Around The World

### Bible Makes The Ratings

The BBC reports its serialization of the Bible is attracting 600,000 listeners a day. John Gielgud, who does an excellent job of narration, started with Genesis and there are plans for the Koran and possibly the Bhagavad Gita, the seminal work for Hindus.

### Expanded AASUB

AASUB is now The Australian and New Zealand United Readers Association (ANZURA).

An affiliation between book readers in Australia and New Zealand has been formed. This represents an expansion of the former AASUB of Australian readers.

ANZURA is a non-profit organization with a simple organizational structure.

The main objectives of the association are to support the steady spread of the revelation through undramatic, everyday means, by encouraging local, autonomous and informal URANTIA Book study groups. It maintains a readership network designed to facilitate contact between reachers if they wish. ANZURA also sponsors and supports an annual conference for students of _The URANTIA Book_ which is hosted by different study groups and held at different locations from year to year. A bulletin is published on a quarterly basis which keeps the membership up to date with the activities of the association. It also supports the aims and objectives of Urantia Foundation.

Readers of _The URANTIA Book_ are invited to enquire about membership in ANZURA. A copy of the constitution and an application for membership are available on request.

For further information or enquiries contact the secretary:

### Vatican Enters New Age

The Vatican has issued a lengthy statement on the media, Aetatis Novae (Of The New Age), which not only urges the church to take media communication seriously but goes so far as to urge that “education and training in communication should be an integral part of the formation of pastoral workers and priests”.

In getting wise to the media, bishops should even “seek the collaboration of professionals in secular media and of the church's own media-related organizations, including especially the international and national organizations for film, radio-television and the press”.The document goes on: “As the Spirit helped the prophets of old to see the divine plan in the signs of their times, so today The Spirit helps the church interpret the signs of our times and carry out its prophetic tasks, among which the study, evaluation, and right use of communications technology and the media...are now fundamental”.

The document suggests increased communications technology has been a ‘mixed blessing’ in that it is only of general benefit if based on “sound values and wise choices on the part of individuals, the private sector, governments and society as a whole”.

The Vatican says it does not seek to be an arbiter in such matters but believes it can assist in “indicating ethical and moral criteria which are relevant to the process, criteria which are to be found in both human and Christian values”

How long it will take for the Vatican's suggestions to be heeded in Australia might be interesting to observe.

### Vatican Defends Earth Summit Stance

_P. Pullella, Reuters, UPI_

The world's population does not need to be cut to solve ecological problems, the Vatican told the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

“Population growth is seldom the primary cause of environmental problems,” says a confidential memo on the summit, sent to Vatican diplomats around the world.

“There are no links between the numbers of people and degradation of the environment. The less populated nations of the north are responsible for most of the abuse of the environment.”

The stand comes after criticism of the Catholic ban on contraception and charges denied by the Vatican, that it tried to keep birth control off the summit agenda.

Development experts have argued that curbing population growth will help protect the environment.

The European Communities environmental commissioner, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, of Italy, said population growth was the biggest problem confronting the summit.

He said a survey showed it took 10,000 generations to produce a population of 2 billion but it would take only one generation to double the present population of 5.5 billion.

The United Nations contends that the world population will double by 2030 and industrial output will need to quintuple to meet its needs.

The Catholic Church bans all artificial birth control. The Vatican memo adds: “Systematic campaigns against birth, directed towards the poorest populations, may even lead to a tendency towards a form of racism. Programs for reducing populations, directed and financed by the developed nations of the north, easily become a substitute for justice and development in the developing nations of the south”.

### Contemplative Prayer

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Queensland_

We are given a great deal of information in _The URANTIA Book_ — suggestions, techniques, benefits etc., on the topic of prayer. It appears that there is a fine dividing line between prayer and worship and hence, in referring to Jesus — “The Master prayed very little for himself, although he engaged in much worship of the nature of understanding communion with his Paradise Father” (1620).

In giving his apostles instructions in response to their queries on prayer -“this all-important and worshipful practice” — he described prayer as “the sincere and longing look of the child to its spirit Father; it is a psychologic process of exchanging the human will for the divine will. Prayer is a part of the divine plan for making over that which is into that which ought to be” (1621). Now what does this mean? I read on and discover that “Practically all of Jesus' praying was done in the spirit and in the heart — silently” and that the “Master so rarely uttered his prayers as spoken words”. I get the impression that not only did he not utter the words, he did not pray mentally in words. I suspect that Jesus' praying was in the form encouraged by the Catholic religion called ‘contemplative prayer’. If my suspicion is correct, another cheer for Jesus Michael's Spirit of Truth as it has again broken through the traditional barriers of formalized religion by building on what was, so as to make it what it ought to be.

Oh how I would love to pray as Jesus prays. All I know is that, with every shred of what limited intellect I possess, I wish my will to be attuned to God's will. I want to learn all interesting new prayers as mine are so repetitive. I start to pray and then burst into laughter. God knows what I need, before I ask Him and I want what He wants for me — simple as that.

I chat away to Him, normally praying for strength and humour, and then I get truly serious about this praying business ard think I will try some contemplative praying. I sit for thirty seconds, having given strict instructions to my mind that this is genuine praying time — I want it! All is quiet, and I smile so happily. I am sure that my heart and my Thought Adjuster and soul are praying away with truly professional style and zeal. But I want to check up. My conscious mind wants to make sure that this is what is transpiring, and it also desires to add a few little requests, just in case the others have overlooked them.

I am convinced that I have a most patient, loving Thought Adjuster! In an attempt to help, I decide to pray for patience and then think perhaps it would be more appropriate if all effort went into a spot more wisdom, or maybe understanding, or even perhaps mercy! But then maybe there are another 200 characteristics which should rank of higher priority. I toss up my hands in confusion and settle for an affirmation — “For eternity, it is my will that your will be mine. I pray, Dear Father that you teach me to be, and love, as Jesus was, and loves”.

Prior to _The URANTIA Book_, praying was all so easy. I would burden God with my needs and then happily trip through life sublimely confident that I had let Him know where I stood and what I required (after all He had a big universe to run, and would be in doubt unless I let Him know). These days I am marginally wiser, and smile as I hear His response to my prayer. The attunement of my will to His, is beyond my ability to comprehend. It is the progression to a level where our wills are identifiable. I know not the path to my perfection; He does and will guide me. His guidance is clear and unambiguous.

I am to get off my pedestal of illusion, roll up my mental sleeves, pick up the blue book and read and understand and integrate its teachings into my being. _The URANTIA Book_ gives in excess of 100 character portrayals (I have not counted, but for the mathematically inclined, it would be of interest to see just how many). These descriptions of the various personalities — ranging from Lucifer, to the apostles, Jesus' family and the many people Jesus met — give a detailed explanation of their weaknesses and their attempts to rectify either themselves or the world around them. I verily believe that practically every imperfect and undesirable human characteristic is exemplified in this book, as well as the way to overcome them. I may not have them all, but as sure as I am that I am imperfect, I recognize some glaring examples of myself in descriptions of others. Before the blue book my desire to ‘be perfect’ was all in God's hands. These days I am expected to pull my weight. If I want to be ‘perfect’ then I am given all the information in regard to my imperfection, plus a foolproof technique to overcome them.

I believe I can understand the philosophy of those who say that _The URANTIA Book_ is the work of the devil. Did not Jesus say to ask whatever you wish of the Father, and he would go up and twist His arm and guarantee that you got it? Jesus was like a religious Aladdin's lamp. All we had to do was pray and we would be perfect. When taken literally, disappointment met many good folks' endeavours, when the Mercedes was not in the family garage with a ‘Love from God’ card. A goodly number of charismatics finally became more mature and started to realize that perhaps the more appropriate request was for ‘perfection’, and the spiritual tools to do “greater works than these”. Imagine their shock if they read _The URANTIA Book_ after which the pathway to perfection requires an inordinate amount of effort, and a precise map is provided which states exactly the direction. The road is not formed, we are required to build it as we go.

### Religious Publishing Bears Fruit

_By Anna Dollard_
_(Courtesy Of ‘Australian Bookseller \& Publisher’)_

Religious publishing in Australia is experiencing something of a boom. More and more readers are turning to religious titles and an increasing number of religious books are breaking through the specialist barrier and appearing in general book stores — not only in the religious section at the back of the shop. Browse through the biography, issues, belief and even teenage fiction categories of a general book store and you are more likely than ever before to turn up a religious title.

The breakthrough, say religious publishers, is a result of a greater openness in the community about religion and spirituality. “All the old idols have been shattered, and traditional beliefs turned upside down”, says Albatross Publishers Director John Waterhouse. “Paradoxically that has meant a greater openness to ideas and alternative ways of thinking”. John says the past 12 months have seen a significant growth in demand for original, Australian books on religion, with readers having at least wearied of what he describes as mediocre and bland titles which “rehash the same issues with little sparkle or originality”.

The growing demand for Australian over imported titles was repeated time and time again to $A B \& P$. Chris Pfeiffer, Marketing Manager at Lutheran Publishing House, says the latest bestseller list from the US covering religious titles made him feel “very sad”. “Apart from evergreens, C S Lewis' ‘Mere Christianity’ and Granger Westburg's ‘Good Grief’, the rest of the list is pretty listless. It's all pap”.

John Waterhouse says Australia's growing sense of national identity has contributed to the move away from imported religious writings, from both the US and UK. “As Australian society diverges from Anglo-Saxon-based culture there is a loss of market for overseas books. English books are becoming too culturally specific with many of the biographies and fiction works not relevant to Australia.” While Albatross distributes U.K.-based Lion books, it has retained its market here by offering religious reference works specifically aimed at the international market. The US, according to John, throws up a different problem with reliance on ‘celebrity authors’ — big names in the US who may be preachers or TV evangelists “authors with reputations who are drained and dried out writing on issues that are simply not where we are at”.

Cathy Jenkins, the religious publisher at Collins Dove says she is amazed at the general popularity of Carolyn Jones' ‘Search for Meaning’ volumes and Michael Leunig's little books of prayer, ‘A Common Prayer’ and ‘Prayer Tree’. “People are now prepared to admit they are searching for something” says Cathy. “It also has to do with the economy. When people fall on hard times they tend to think more deeply on key questions of life. In the past, general stores only carried the odd illustrated Bible, the type you'd find in dentists' waiting rooms. Now you're seeing many more self-help and religious books.” Changing patterns in education, with more people completing tertiary studies, has also contributed to the demand for religious writing, says Cathy. “religion, generally, interests thinking people. There are now wide avenues for people who want to read. Whereas in the past they may have read a novel, now they are turning to other thinkers, reading about their life journey.”

According to E J Dwyers Editorial manager, Catherine Hammond, the type of religious books being sought out by the general trade overlap between New Age and the spiritual. Referring to this market as the ‘newer seekers’ Catherine notes that this growing market has come in addition to, and not at the expense of, the traditional market. “There is a polarity with the New Age or newer-seekers on the one hand and the traditionalists on the other. In every church there are the two groups. It's no longer the traditional Protestant and Catholic concerns of the past. We now have the forward thinkers and the more traditional thinkers. It cuts right across the old dividing lines.”

E J Dwyer continues to publish traditional Catholic works, including texts used in the Mass, alongside of its ‘New Age’ titles. “There is now such a spectrum in the Church that the two polarities are not affected by the other. That gives more scope to religious publishing. There is a feeling of being unencumbered. We haven't lost the old market while we have gained a large share of a new one. It's a great time for religious publishing.”

E J Dwyer has benefitted from the ‘blossoming phenomenon’ of general readers seeking scripture writings that once would have been published with only a traditional Bible study group in mind. One of its recent releases, ‘Introducing Contemporary Theologies’, by Neil Omerod, a lecturer in theology at St. Paul's seminary, is one title to have attracted both general readers and serious students of theology. On the flip side, religious publishing is also seeing respected theologians tackling issues in a way that is accessible to lay people. Dwyer's ‘Making Australia’, by Marist priest John Thornhill, is another such book. His writings on the spiritual aspects of Australian life and where religion fits in explores Australian attitudes in general, including the tall-poppy syndrome and why Australians hesitate to be overtly religious.

Perhaps the biggest religious title to cross over into mainstream literature this year will be ‘Jesus The Man’ by Dr Barbara Thiering, published by Transworld who has already sold the rights to the book in the US, UK and Canada. The controversial book based on the Dead Sea Scrolls, will also be serialised in a major newspaper and national colour magazine.

### Science And The Spirit

_By Bryan Appleyard,_
_Author Of ‘Understanding The Present: Science And the Soul of Modern Man’ (Picador, 1992)_

Here are the last lines of two recent books which have attempted to popularise the latest and weirdest developments in scientific thought.

The first: If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason — for then we should know the mind of God.

The second: We are truly meant to be here.

The first is the closing rhetorical flourish of Stephen Hawkin's super best-seller, ‘A Brief History of Time’. The second is the conclusion of Paul Davies's book, ‘The Mind of God’. Both men are physicists, and neither knows what he is talking about.

For Hawking, evoking God is an empty gesture, since he believes in no such being. In the case of Davies, there is a genuine intellectual progression to the idea of a real human purpose. But his terms are hopelessly narrow.

What counts, however, is not the physics, nor the hubristic and muddled ambition of their claims — it's the fact that both feel qualified by their discipline to say such things, and that, in the case of Hawking, millions have bought the book, presumably in the conviction that he is right.

Scientissts, through such popular channels, are at last coming clean: they, and only they, hold the key to the meaning, purpose and justification of human life. The truth or otherwise of this claim, as well as the question of whether it is the real underlying belief by which we conduct our lives, is the most urgent issue of our age. Indeed, I believe it is the only issue of our age, the decisive debate that shapes all others. If we do not begin to understand science, we cannot claim to understand the present.

For 400 years we have lived in the shadow of the scientific enlightenment. This is the modern age. It began when a number of scientists of genius (primarily Galileo and Newton) exploded the medieval world view, and a number of philosophers (notably Descartes and Kant) struggled to rebuild human certainties in the wake of that detonation. The medieval world was destroyed by the discovery of the quite staggeringly effective intellectual method that we now call science.

In contrast, the new cosmos was a machine. Whether we were part of it or not was irrelevant — it just ground on regardless. Humankind lost its place in the universe. With Charles Darwin, it also lost its place on Earth. Even in the Newtonian machine we could still believe that our lives were special. But Darwin showed we were accidents of deep time and blind evolution.

With Freud, our expulsion from Eden was completed — we were exiled from the world of our own mind, which turned out to be no more than the brutal conflict between instinct and the world, all laced with an extraordinarily vicious death wish.

This is a familiar story to scientists such as Hawking and Davies, and to previous popularisers such as Bronowski and Sagan, but they do not put it quite like this. They see the story as a happy one, a heroic one in which the human mind gradually frees itself from crushing dogma and learns to roam the stars or peer into the minutest workings of matter or life.

What they ignore is the urgent issue of how people are supposed to lead their lives in the aftermath of such insights.

At first, the philosophers did not ignore this. The great enlightenment figures struggled to find a new way of defining the specifically human. This was to prove a truly heroic enterprise because of the odds they were fighting against. For, as time passed and technology improved, science became ever more devastatingly effective.

First it explained the cosmos to those who were qualified to look. But later it produced machines, cured diseases and generated wealth so efficiently that everybody was affected. Science was so flamboyantly good at these things that it must be right, it must be "The Truth'.

> The Oddest Thing About The Science I Have Been Describing Is Not Simply That it creates a cosmic machine that does not need us, but that science only actually works on the assumption that we do not exist.

But if it was right in that way, then humankind was a purposeless nothing. Trying to discover meaning or morality in such circumstances was pointless. It was no good pretending: we were alone with whatever values we could construct in the privacy of our own heads. “A dog,” said Charles Darwin, bleakly, “might as well speculate on the mind of Newton. Let each man hope and believe what he can.”

And Freud, with his characteristic tragic sense, wrote: “Thus I have not the courage to rise up before my fellow men as a prophet, and I bow to their reproach that I can offer them no consolation...”

This is the bitter message of classical science. This is ‘The Truth’, but it has no place for us; we can find no basis for our values in the world. Most scientists circumvent this problem by insisting on the limitation of their field, by saying that science is one specialised realm of knowledge.

The power and effectiveness of this view forced some philosophers finally to capitulate. With Bertrand Russell and A.J. Ayer came the last cowardly admission of failure — henceforth philosophy was to be no more than the handmaiden of science, helpfully, sycophantically, deciphering the concepts handed down by the high priests of this new, unconsoling truth. But, in spite of its apparent triumphs and its philosophical groupies, there were two barriers which hard, classical, pessimistic science found it impossible to cross. The first was the question “Why?”

The Newtonian cosmic machine was self-sustaining: it just kind of hung about the place like some thick-witted skinhead — mute, gormless and callous. Science could observe and theorise about this brute, but not about anything else. Why it was there, what it was for, and whether there was anything else were questions beyond the scientists' reach.

This, of course, left room for God: he was simply outside the system, not inside, in the workings of nature, as the medieval theologians had said. The second barrier was subtler. This was the barrier of the human self.

The oddest thing about the science I have been describing is not simply that it creates a cosmic machine that does not need us, but that science only actually works on the assumption that we do not exist.

This is a complex point that has been spotted and argued about by many 20th-century scientists and philosophers. But it can be summarised simply: we observe nature with the assumption that our presence does not affect our observations. We are utterly neutral observers, the fact of our consciousness does not affect what we observe.

To some this may seem like common sense. To me, it seems like one of the weirdest and most extreme demands ever placed upon the human imagination — yet it is a demand which, to a large extent, we still obey. The fact that classical science (roughly speaking, science up to the year 1900) appeared to be able to talk about anything except the sensation of the human consciousness meant that the attempt to find a moral defence against the successes of science moved progressively inwards.

From the Reformation onwards, the dominant theme in western thought has been the attempt to find a solid basis inside the self from which to arrive at some system of values. This basis was needed precisely because science had invalidated the alternatives.

The movement inwards inspired great thinkers — Descartes, Kant, Kierkegaarde — but in our age it inspires mainly trash Narcissism — self- worship — the hallmark of popular culture; it is the primary defining quality of technologically advanced and affluent societies. We are told to diet to be thin, to exercise to avoid illness, to use cosmetics to stay young, and even, when age really strikes, to have dangerous and useless plastic surgery.

Corrupted psychoanalysis — the psychobabble interminably propagated on television shows in the United States and, increasingly, here — is employed to induce anxiety and the spurious conviction that the self and its ‘relationships’ are the moral centre of our lives.

The scientific world has denied us our external anchor for our values. It seems to have made everything either controllable by our problem- solving ingenuity or understandable by our analytic and experimental powers. Out there, we seem to have no role; but in here, in the refuge of the self, we can find something to do, we can find values.

In the 20th century, they will say, science has changed and so it has. From the moment when the great physicist Max Planck arrived at the idea of the quantum (during a walk in the woods in, conveniently enough, 1900), 20th century science has become progressively more weird and progressively more unclassical.

> ...only when science has been returned to its proper place as a part, but only a small part, of the totality of human culture, can it really become science again.

The three big weirdos, of which most people have now heard, are: quantum mechanics, Relativity and chaos theory. Explaining them in this space would be impossible. But it is easy to describe their primary message.

Quantum mechanics appears to destroy the basic fabric of causality and to confuse the position of the observer with what is being observed. relativity overthrows the absolutism of Newtonian time and space, revealing them to be a single continuum which curves and loops through the universe. Chaos theory reveals the linearity of classical mathematics as a seriously deficient model of the real world.

In short, the message of all three theories is: classical science is wrong insofar as it claims to be a final interpretation of reality.

But the Weird Three have also led to a carnival of philosophical and religious fun. For if classical science was wrong all along, then maybe its bleak, pessimistic message is also wrong. This is an enormously important development in the cultural and imaginative history of the scientific world, and it is one which now divides science.

On one side are devoutly classical, hard scientists such as Dawkins and the Oxford scientist Peter Atkins, whose book ‘The Creation’ provided one of the most powerful restatements of the case. “There is nothing that cannot be understood,” he wrote, “...there is nothing that cannot be explained, and...everything is extraordinarily simple.”

For people such as Atkins — and, indeed, for most scientists in their daily work — there is nothing especially weird about the Weird Three. They are simply further developments in our understanding of the world which modify, but do not overthrow, the temple of classical science.

But the hard-science view of Atkins, Hawking and Dawkins is not affected by such changes. Indeed, the new science actually stimulates their ambitions. The reason is that the cosmos of relativity and quantum mechanics is no longer a dumb skinhead, just hanging there. Rather, it has become a dynamic, evolving system, a ‘wave-form’ in quantum speak. And the speculative power of our new theories has enabled us to penetrate this system outward to its spatial and temporal limits and inward to the ultimate constituents of matter. With our radio telescopes listening to the faint echoes of the big bang, or in the vast underground doughnuts in which we collide particles, we seem to be drawing ever closer to the final outer and inner extremities of existence.

> Our Experience And Our History Are More Real Than Either. We Know This To Be true, but science has done terrible damage to our faith. It is time to start making repairs.

This leads science to the brink of asking the forbidden question: “why?” It offers the chance of a Theory of Everything, a grand set of equations that will embody the How, the Why and the What Next of creation. And this means that, in the hands of the hard scientists, new science is invading the final stronghold of philosophy and faith, the first of the barriers to the final triumph of classical science.

The other barrier, you will recall, was the self. For the moment, these defences appear stronger. Robot technology has been a long slow struggle to mimic even the smallest aspect of human behaviour, and the so-called ‘artificial intelligence’ planned for the next generation of computers is a wild misnomer.

Nevertheless, computer processing and memory functions are set to achieve ‘human equivalence’ within a few years. This means only that computers will theoretically be as big and as fast as a human brain; it emphatically does not mean they can function with the flexibility and massive complexity of the human brain.

But the question is: Can we create a mechanical self, a machine possessed of a self-consciousness similar to our own? And behind this question lies the deeper, older question: Are we just machines? If we are, then presumably one day we can download our ‘selves’ on to floppy discs, make copies and become immortal. It may come as a shock to realise that human immortality is actually an item on the speculative scientific agenda these days. But it is. The urgency of this issue is obvious to anybody who cares to look, not just because of the idea of immortality but because of the more immediate question of what the human self actually is. Science and the entire culture are now pushing hard against the barrier of the self.

It is vital that none of this is dismissed as some kind of academic parlour game. Scientists are talking about immortality; they are working on intelligent machines. Ethical issues arising from their work — embryo research, animal experimentation, and so on — arise with accelerating frequency. And, above all, science is silently accepted as our contemporary Truth.

But perhaps the insight that makes the urgency of this most obvious is the realisation that science is the defining force behind our liberal-democratic societies.

Others have recently said the same thing. Francis Fukuyama in ‘The End of History’ and ‘The Last Man’ pinpoints science as the decisive factor which gave a particular direction to history. Allan Bloom, in ‘The Closing of the American Mind’, sees scientific attitudes behind the paralysing refusal within the American education system to defend the cultural heritage of the West.

I agree with them both: the open-endedness, the valuelessness, the apparent objectivity and effectiveness of science have progressively stripped away any reason to value one way of life, one system, above another. Modern scientific attitudes — because of science's effectiveness rather than any conspiracy by scientists — destroy purpose in life, reduce us all to a condition of blank adolescent nihilism.

There is an answer to all this, but it is not easily understood. It is not an anti-scientific answer, although it does involve the humbling of science and the ridiculing of some of its more absurd and incoherent rhetoric. As Bloom and others have pointed out, only when science has been returned to its proper place as a part, but only a small part, of the totality of human culture, can it really become science again.

The answer is not easily understood because it needs to be realised. It certainly cannot lie in any developments within science itself. It is as pointless trying to find God in the quantum or in chaos theory as it was to find him in the Newtonian cosmos. Science will move on — and where will God be then?

The answer lies in finding a belief in all of what we are, or perhaps in simply admitting what we are. Nothing about our lived experience ever corresponded to Newton's laws of motion, and nothing in Hawking's equations will ever resemble what our natures demand of the mind of God.

Our experience and history are more real than either. We know this to be true, but science has done terrible damage to our faith. It is time to start making repairs.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### Spreading The Message

_The URANTIA Book_ has instructed us about the importance of secondary works to get its basic teachings into general circulation (43:3). Even in western countries that have a literacy rate well above 90% of the population, surveys have indicated that less than one in ten adults ever read a serious book. Which surely means that _The URANTIA Book_ is unlikely to be widely read in the foreseeable future.

It seems a shame to have its wonderful teachings bottled up between its blue covers in unread form. What can we do about it?

For the immediate future some of us believe that there may be potential in wrapping up the teachings of the book into adventure stories and have commenced a project entitled ‘The Adventures of Jesus of Nazareth’, though we may change the name later. The idea is to write an exciting but ‘fictitious’ account of the life of Jesus which will nevertheless convey his teachings. As far as is possible every chapter will contain at least one ‘cliff hanger’ episode in the tradition of the old time western movie serials or the modern ‘soapies’. The approach is simple, you just get your characters into impossible situations then get them out again.

To give an example, let's take the incident related in _The URANTIA Book_ of the “Young man who was afraid” (1437). Jesus had several lessons to impart to this young man. He tried one approach that failed, so then tried another by asking for the young man's help. Recall that the young man was fearful, depressed, and downcast. The modern soapy producer knows that he has to dramatize situations in order to hold an audience. No problem — we relocate the young man on the edge of a cliff, getting ready to jump to his death.

The enterprising author might place his victim on a high ridge with a thousand feet drop on either side and have Jesus make his approach by talking to the young man while himself moving onto the ridge — it is up to you to invent your own scenario.

Whatever that scenario may be, the lessons to be imparted can be faithfully included from _The URANTIA Book_ itself — which is what the page 43 , paragraph 3 message is telling us to do (please include footnotes to inform our editors of your reference material).

If the idea appeals to you and you are a frustrated author, how about joining us in the writing of the book? Most such incidents can be more or less independent chapters that will find a place somewhere in the life story of Jesus. We can readily organize the names of people and locations to fit into the general theme. What we need is imaginative adventure stories that incorporate your favorite teachings from the book. All of this can be done without infringing the present copyright and, in any case, accords with the instructions of a Divine Counselor. The editorial panel will look after copyright details.

Send your contributions to ‘Book Project, Six-O-Six’. Just a single story would help but don't feel limited. The ultimate aim is an illustrated book, including maps, suitable particularly for teenage and adult readers. We are not aiming at the intellectual end of the market, so please keep it simple.

> The Urantia Book Has Instructed Us About The Importance Of Secondary Works to get its basic teachings into general circulation (43:3).

The operation is designed to be a non-profit service to the Master. So don't expect royalties or accolades there aren't going to be any. An editorial panel will be announced as soon as we get it together. Eight chapters are already written in draft form. Serious contributors may write for a copy.

Please send contributions as typed copy, or better, on computer disk in ASCII, Word Perfect, Q\&A, or other word processor that we may be able to decipher.

### God's Limitations

_by Neil Francey_

_Even God cannot alter the past. For that purpose,>  we have historians. And movies. And mythologies. And Walt Disney. History becomes national autobiography, and we know that of all literary forms, autobiography is the least reliable, the most inclined to flattery._
> 
> _Phillip Adams (columnist)_

How accurately are we charting the emergence of the fifth epochal revelation? Is it a stand alone document with nothing further to record?

The book places so much recognition on the individual, along with information to design the perfect self-development course that the group effort of our forebears and the expected public perception of the book's content, need not disturb the erstwhile student. The fact that the recordings of such activity may be erroneous lends further support to the idea that extraneous reports are irrelevant. Of historical interest only. Merely a diversion. For what can be authenticated?

True, it behoves us to know our origins. But which of the interpretations shall we accept? For indeed we are told all original documentation has been destroyed. The URANTIA Foundation is likely to be in possession of many other significant and sensitive records, but these are unlikely to be entrusted to any historian.

The point being that we can all live without this information. We are not bound to assumed or actual content, we are not deprived.

However, we would be deprived if the original text of the book was deleted from, added to, or altered, prior to publication. Who, if anyone, could know of this?

With the lapse of time it doesn't seem to matter whether ‘history’ is true or not. The public has lost interest, 'national security' is no longer threatened. Kennedy's assassination was a conspiracy, the Great Train Robbery netted three times the amount admitted by authorities, Scott of the Antarctic was not a hero but an incompetent explorer, Japan is only now begrudgingly admitting to war crimes. War! Now there's an embarrassment to all. Churchill's exaggerations of triumphs, Stalin's rewriting of events, the storming of the Bastille, the reasons for Vietnam. The list equates to the number of wars.

As Voltaire put it: “History is about fables that have been agreed upon”.

Moving closer to home, we should consider the metamorphosis that has taken place about the receipt of
_The URANTIA Book_ text, the early Forum, 1955, Christy, the Foundation/Brotherhood split.

Will powerful myths, if they do exist, prevent us from having the record set straight? When the past becomes diorama, it is beyond the scrutiny of both scholarship and critic.

Thus it is only good sense to concentrate our efforts on _The URANTIA Book_ as the means to assist in the development of techniques to aid communication with our indwelling spirit.

There must be, however, a distinction between various classes of irrelevancy. We are not to be like

Christian fundamentalists who are undisturbed by the revelations of biblical scholarship. By way of example, an excellent and recent book called ‘Jesus, a New Vision’ by Marcus J. Borg reveals a Jesus previously little known outside of URANTIA Book readers. But will the mainstream accept it?

Which all leads to our current court room battle and the fact that, with varied accounts, it too shall pass into history. But it shall leave in its wake an enduring legacy of divisiveness, with the emergence of two opposing factions like never before.

Each shall be able to substantiate their position by reverting to the ‘facts’ of history.

We scoff with dismay at the Irish folly, we observe military forces fighting rebels in so many Third World countries, we despair at the Holy Wars that consume the Middle East. But do we now stop to think we are heading down the same well worn path of religious intolerance to be stripped of the power to drive a major revelation?

Then again, maybe such fragmentation is in accordance with the envisaged destiny of this planet. Again we return to the fact that the individual is supreme. Individuals can, and do, run this revelation. Not an organization.

As an individual, I'd like to believe that although the ideologies of _The URANTIA Book_ are sacrosanct, should ever other matters related thereto come between me and a friend, I shall lay them to one side as having no real cosmic relevance, and embrace my friend.

### The Master

_condensed from _The URANTIA Book_ (1102/3)_

The Son of Man was always a well-poised personality. He was unafraid, surcharged with divine enthusiasm, but never fanatical. He was emotionally active, never flighty, imaginative, but always practical. He frankly faced the realities of life. He was always courageous, never reckless; prudent but never cowardly; sympathetic but not sentimental; unique but not eccentric; pious but not sanctimonious; well-poised and perfectly unified.

Jesus' originality was unstifled; he was not bound by tradition or conventionality though he taught with absolute authority. The most original of his teachings was the emphasis of love and mercy in the place of fear and sacrifice.

Jesus exhorted his followers to preach the gospel to all peoples, his sympathetic heart embraced all of mankind. Always his invitation was, “Whosoever will, let them come.” Jesus sublimely trusted the Father, even as a little child trusts his parents. No matter how cruel nature might appear to be or how indifferent to man's welfare on earth, Jesus never faltered in his faith. He was immune to disappointment, impervious to persecution, and untouched by apparent failure. He loved men as brothers. He went about doing good.

The Master was an unusually cheerful person, exhorting us always to “Be of good cheer.” He could maintain this attitude because of his unswerving trust in God and unshakable confidence in man. He loved mankind; he believed in us. He never grew weary of saying, “It is more blessed to give than to receive.” He was frank, but always friendly, outspoken in his love for the sinner and in his hatred for sin.

Jesus was filled with enthusiasm for the gospel of the kingdom and was unreservedly dedicated to “the Father's business.” This divine enthusiasm led the onlooking universe to appraise him as the model of sanity and the pattern of supreme mortal devotion to the high standards of spiritual living. And his controlled enthusiasm was contagious; his associates were constrained to share his divine optimism.

His courage was equalled only by his patience. He was never in a hurry, his composure was sublime. Though often indignant at evil and intolerant of sin, his indignation against sin never led to anger at the sinner.

Jesus was great because he was good, and yet he fraternized with the little children. He was gentle and unassuming in his personal life, yet was the perfected man of the universe. His associates called him Master unbidden.

Today, as in Galilee, he continues to enter the human mind to elevate, transform, and transfigure it. It is literally true: “If any man has Christ Jesus within him, he is a new creature; old things are passing away; behold all things are becoming new.”

### When All Is Said And Done

> “_And it will not be so much by the words you speak but by the lives you live that men will know that you have been with me and have learned of the realities of the kingdom._” ([UB 140:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p1_7))
