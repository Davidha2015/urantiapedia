## Editor's Notebook

I constantly wonder if we are all reading the same book, the fifth of only five revelations of epochal significance to the planet.

The enormity of presenting such a project, and the obvious care taken to avoid even the slightest misinterpretation, at times seems of scant regard.

Our mental capacities and experiences cause us to read selectively. It is the only way to explain the different perspectives on facts, as distinct from our collective endeavours to interpret truth, so lovingly offered by the revelators. Is the book a complete statement for its time? Can reincarnation be accommodated within its teachings? Does the superb authority of Jesus' teachings automatically qualify serious students as fundamentalists? To these and numerous other theories, we have varying degrees of yes, no, and maybe.

I would suggest there can never be any recognized movement of book readers without some basic cohesiveness. Fringe adherents will then be readily identified as such. For today, however, the mainstream has not sufficiently emerged. But it will by its truth content.

And by communication among individual readers, between organizations and across nations. Error of interpretation has to be minimized.

If the cross-fertilization of ideas does not take place on international levels, parochial study groups could get it wrong. So much for the value of study groups or individuals to analyse in isolation.

Furthermore, the book is overlooked as a guide to revelatory and evolutionary progress. It provides insight on dissemination of truth, understanding of human nature, particularly in matters of religion, and a focus to correct us as we promulgate error and half truth.

If we consider that we have an identity crisis now, wait until we enter the unknown land of deregulation. The status of today, for good or bad, becomes irretrievable.

Irrespectively, we will have solved nothing:

* There will never be sufficient funds to develop essential programs.
* We still won't know what to do with a revelation.
* Organizational structures will complicate and dominate.
* Media, political, religious, educational, and big business influences have yet to be exerted.

There is however, a oneness of identity we find at conferences. In this regard the triennial is the most influential. They prove that, with all our differing ideologies, only the Brotherhood of Man elevates us into context.

As we leave the safe landscape of communication with each other, and enter the clamouring mindscape of an impersonal and electronic future, we'd better be sure of our understanding of that book.

Many will be the distractions to deflect our attention (by some — intentionally) from our task. Teachings will get distorted for wider appeal. Even now, new readers are subjected to claims they wrongly assume originate in, or are sanctioned by, _The URANTIA Book_.

We are well advised to study, to share insights and experiences, to present clearly and factually to others.

The world wants spiritual nourishment and has not the requisite powers of discrimination.

The prosperity of our planet is not in numbers, but in the quality and value of our labours for truth.

## So They Say

**Current Affairs Bulletin**

In some quarters the very idea of government and opposition, as expressly established by party alignments under a Westminster system of parliament, are seen to detract from the possibility of a mature, co-operative society sensibly arriving at consensual decisions and adopting policies without undue conflict.

**BBC Wildlife Magazine**

The keynote address made by HRH The Prince of Wales to the World Commission on Environment and Development is one of the clearest summaries of world problems, and refers to the quiet revolution in human philosophy, politics, and economics that the world needs if, in the next century there is going to be a world worth living in.

**Third World Bulletin**

Most governments are building up their arsenals in the belief that they are buying greater security. But for developing countries, for example, India, they must face the choice of spending $13,500 to create one job in the arms industry compared to $90 in road construction or $80 in agriculture.

**Professor Sabry, University of California, Berkeley**

From a development and physiological point of view, unless we pay attention to the nutrition, the health, and the education of girls, we are not likely to have women who are able to deliver a healthy child.

Food deprivation is a very naked, very obvious and overt form of child abuse.

## Letters To The Editor

### Conference In France

_Martin Mcburney, Melbourne_

The third international encounter in France for URANTIA Book readers was held from 1st to 8th August. Previous encounters were in 1986 and 1989, with one or two Australians at each. More than 50 people from Europe and North America, and this lone Australian, met at Haguenau in the Alsace region of eastern France. I was delighted to meet again with 10 friends from our conference at Robertson (Australia) in 1988.

For me the encounter was an experience rather than an event. The week had those special qualities that we have experienced at conferences in Australia. It also had special qualities arising from the French influence, the C.E.R.D.H. organizers, and the facilitating interpreters.

There was plenty of free time around the meals, and in the evenings. There was a day excursion to Strasbourg. Each day there was a morning and afternoon study group, for two hours each. Eight subjects were planned initially, each reflecting the encounter theme of “to have — to be to do”. Before each study group we booked our preferred choice. The first eight persons comprised the study group for that subject at that session. Subjects with few bookings required us to choose another. The same subjects were offered again at each session, with deletions and additions during the week. Each of these sessions was a discussion group, with no pre-prepared materials and with only the occasional direct reading from _The URANTIA Book_.

The encounter was bi-lingual — everything was interpreted in both French and English. This had the interesting effect of slowing down all discussions and announcements, and many conversations. The C.E.R.D.H. organizers are considering the possibility of other encounters in French only.

A wonderful encounter — my best wishes to the old and new friends from Haguenau.

### On Channelling

_Willi Summers, Perth_

I feel compelled to comment on your article under the heading “Editor's Notebook”. It doesn't take much to work out that this is mainly aimed at the people in Sedona. In defence, I must say that it is a pity you didn't do more homework before printing this article as you have made a big error with your statements: “To over-rule the book would claim to have access to a higher authority” and "which group then, is laying claim to be the deliverer of
the sixth epochal revelation? Already so soon! the Fifth supposedly obsolete!"

I hope you will correct these statements in the next issue of Six-O-Six, as no-one has made these claims; they are your own words. _The URANTIA Book_ is most definitely not being “over-ruled” and far from “obsolete”. Some of the people in Sedona have been teachers of the Fifth Epochal Revelation for well over 20 years, long before you ever discovered the book yourself, I would think, and they are still leading many truth seekers to this wonderful book. No-one is calling the recently received transmissions the “sixth epochal revelation”. It is the Continuing Fifth Epochal Revelation.

I know that you cannot accept at this stage what is coming through now and that is your prerogative since we have all been given God's wonderful gift of free will. I believe it took many members of the original Forum several years to accept the Papers which now make up _The URANTIA Book_. It took Dr. Sadler himself many years before he believed any of it. But one can never discredit anything before investigating and reading the contents of these transmissions. It is like saying _The URANTIA Book_ is a load of rubbish before you have ever opened the cover. The same goes for the Bible or any other religious book. Just one page or even a whole Paper out of _The URANTIA Book_ would not make a lot of sense without the rest of the contents. The same goes for the transmissions coming through now.

I also don't believe that when the papers of _The URANTIA Book_ were given that the celestials said, “Well, that's it, citizens of Urantia; this is the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth and there is nothing else for you to learn.” We are eternal students! We have been told that _The URANTIA Book_ is only one tenth of The Fifth Epochal Revelation. I'm certain that if we had been given the complete revelation, it would have been too mind boggling and we would have ended up with a severe case of spiritual indigestion. So, maybe they are giving it to us a little at a time. Surely our celestial friends know when we are ready for the next instalment. So let's not be too judgmental and definitely not twist any facts.

_[Your premise about the Sedona was incorrect. Reference was made to the broader interest in channelling. Ed.]_

### Ignore The Channellers?

_Allan Lane, Perth_

I draw the readership's attention to the “Editor's Notebook” in July/August 1992's issue of Six-O-Six. I have not the slightest doubt that the editor, in writing this article, was wholly motivated by sincere concern for humanity's spiritual welfare. However, after reading my complaint, please read or re-read the article to perhaps corroborate my disapproval of its flavour.

Exceptional tolerance of others, even “those who are dabbling in the activity of channelling” should be a hallmark of truly serious students of _The URANTIA Book_.

Some more quotes from the article: “a sane and sensible readership, who have staunchly chosen to ignore such bewildered souls.” “Don't even consider this phenomenon. Just ignore it and read the book.”

A major problem arises here from these exhortations to ignore “channelled” communications. For example, imagine that you are a young adult in 1933, searching for answers, trying to understand reality. There will be numerous sources of claimed communications from higher authorities to choose from, including the Bible, but not _The URANTIA Book_.

Suppose you befriended a Bible-believer who encouraged you to join his or her organization and you accepted their advice to ignore other sources claiming to be communications from higher authorities. You grow towards middle age by 1956 , and it is not unreasonable to expect you to be vocal against the “satanic” Urantia papers, recently published and available to an unsuspecting public.

> Exceptional tolerance of others, even “those who are dabbling in the activity of channelling” should be a hallmark of truly serious students of _The URANTIA Book_.

The point I am trying to make here is that one day, post 1935 , if not already, higher authorities may communicate a small amount of excellent information or advice for public consumption via someone contemporary. “Believers” of _The URANTIA Book_ acknowledge that such a precedent has been set in the receipt of The Urantia papers. That the vast bulk of “channelled” information that many of us have read smacks blatantly of the outworkings of the mind of the “channeller” does not mean that genuine and helpful further advice from higher authorities will not be communicated soon, or sometime in the next million years. By the way, information from purely human sources is often very helpful and uplifting, and it would not worry me if the human author was deceived into believing he or she was not the author — discrimination is the important requisite.

To quote from your article again: “Think carefully and independently.” Excellent advice, but I feel it does not fit comfortably into this article which exhorts us to ignore ideas just because they have been “channelled”. The exposure of one's mind to a great variety of ideas and viewpoints is surely an aid to careful and independent thought. “Dare to depend solely on Jesus' teachings, as spelt out in great detail in _The URANTIA Book_.” There are Bible and Koran believers who say very similar things, elevating their texts to unchallengeable divine status. It saddens me to find this happening with _The URANTIA Book_.

For the record, I have not found any other information and advice that remotely approaches the honesty and splendour of _The URANTIA Book_ so far. Also, I have been moved more to laughter than inspiration by the “channelled” communications which I have read emanating from the URANTIA movement and elsewhere over the years.

An editor of the Six-O-Six has considerable influence, and rightly so, over the ideas presented to its readership by publishing articles within its aims and guidelines. I have therefore no problems with not allowing the publication of “channelled” communications in Six-O-Six. I do, however, have grave misgivings with editorial guidance firmly advising its readership not to read certain material.

_[After reading your complaint, I did re-read the editorial. The challenge was to quote the book not the editor._

_My exhortation was to urge URANTIA Book readers to seriously question their current responses to the practice. Ed.]_

## News Around The World

### Foundation's Australian Office

Since URANTIA Foundation's Australian office has been up and running, the Foundation has attended the Australian Book Fair, listed _The URANTIA Book_ in Australian and New Zealand “Books in Print”, and is continuing to work closely with bookshops so that they may know where to order the book. It has been reported that the response from bookshops has been encouraging. Several months ago only a few specialized bookshops carried _The URANTIA Book_, now many more, like Angus and Robertson, are stocking it and placing orders for their customers. People should now be able to purchase or order _The URANTIA Book_ in a more timely fashion from their local bookshop.

### Price Of _The Urantia Book_

The price of _The URANTIA Book_ ($US34) has not increased since 1979. Given the size, quality, and content of the book, it is underpriced, and this is substantial by the traditional methods of pricing in the book industry.

Effective January 1, 1993, The Urantia Foundation trustees intend to increase the price more in line with industry standards.

It is further noted that the Foundation's Discretionary Discount Program to individuals will be discontinued from October 1, 1992, except in cases where people do not have access to a bookstore.

### Lawsuit Information

In July of this year, a review and update of the US lawsuit was distributed to readers worldwide.

It runs to twelve pages and supports the endeavour to place the Urantia papers into public domain.

Kristen Maaherra is quoted: “Until every single person on the planet has had an opportunity to accept or reject the URANTIA Papers, our work...is not yet done.”

### Inquiry On Australian Copyright Act

Emerging electronic technology has altered the nature of the publishing industry. At present, publishers are precluded from retaining copyright of published material should it be re-used by computer data base or photocopier. The publishers own the copyright for publication and presentation but journalists have copyright for all other purposes which may include use of material by media monitoring services or storage on electronic data banks. Publishers feel they are restricted from providing better access to information or fully utilizing technology. Special rights will be retained for journalist authors whose work is published in book form.

### Environmentalism

_William Wentworth, Towamba, New South Wales_

The absence of religious belief among so many of today's youth has all sorts of results. One of them seems to be the adoption of Environmentalism as a philosophy of life.

It is beginning to look as if Environmentalism will be playing an important part in the philosophy of the twenty-first century, and from some points of view, this is not such a bad thing. It makes sense, after all, to pay attention to the state of our surroundings. Our physical and mental health, our appreciation of beauty, our work and recreational activities, and our material standard of living generally, are dependent on those surroundings.

There are some traps however.

Like the rest of us, environmentalists need meaning and purpose in their lives, and crave some phenomenon, above and beyond themselves, worthy of their devotion. But because they do not accept God as the source of what they need, they have adopted “The Environment” as the ultimate ideal.

There seems to be a couple of main strands here. One group, the secularists, work on the assumption that there is no supermaterial reality, and therefore the well-being of humanity is entirely bound up with that of the planet. The planet, they argue, is a complex balance of natural forces and elements only partially understood, and that mankind is just one among a number of species of living things which contribute to this balance. Man, to them, is entirely an evolutionary product of nature, and his spiritual aspirations are an egotistical delusion. Mankind's egotism has led to its dominance of nature. It is now in plague proportions and must therefore collectively modify its behavior so as to conform with the aim of maintaining the correct balance among the species. This may well involve a drastic reduction in population as well as the dismantling of much of modern civilization, which is the vehicle for extending mankind's dominance. If this domination is allowed to continue, mankind will eventually become so numerous, and so destructive that he will obliterate nature and, in the process, himself.

Another group, the pantheists, see God and nature as being the same thing. God expresses himself as a perfect planetary natural balance. Nature is therefore perfect, and the only source of imperfection and error (self-evident in our world) is the wilful wickedness of men, who, through their civilization, have set themselves outside of nature and departed from the divine order of things. Because men have attempted to dominate and control nature, they have lost the ability to cooperate and work within nature. This departure on the part of mankind from the divinely ordained ways of nature has resulted in worldwide confusion and chaos. Only when men accept their place in nature, and cease trying to improve on God's perfection, will the perfect balance be restored.

There are, no doubt, many other strands in Environmentalism but these two suffice to illustrate my basic theme.

It is interesting to note that both of the above strands owe something to both the Christian tradition and to the humanist revolt against Christianity. Both strands seem influenced by the concept of the Fall of Man. The balance of nature has been upset by man's behaviour, in one instance through success in gaining short term ends, in the other through his wilful wickedness. In both instances, man has brought disaster on himself and his planet in a fashion reminiscent of the Fall of Man depicted in Christianity.

Similarly, both strands exhibit the influence of the humanist revolt. Only a philosophy which holds up man as “the measure of all things” can give rise to the conviction that man's activities are destroying nature. Only a humanistic age could so exaggerate the significance of human activities that they can be considered a threat to nature itself. God knowing people tend to have a more modest view of the power of humanity and show more confidence in the ability of nature to withstand humanity's puny assaults. Nature has, after all, withstood a multitude of cataclysms in the past. Modern humanists tend to be both entranced and terrified by man's technical achievements. They probably overrate them.

But whichever way we choose to look at it, Environmentalism promises to be with us for quite a while yet. As _The URANTIA Book_ (UB 85:0.4) points out,

> “_mortal man has worshipped everything on the face of the earth, including himself._” [UB 85:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/85#p0_4)

Nature worship is not new. The resurgence of such a philosophy in western civilization, if it is as extensive as I think it is, may well have quite wide effects. And unless Western youth chooses once again to worship God, Environmentalism may well continue to appeal to them as an alternative.

### Character Ennoblement.

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Queensland_

By the time that Urantia is settled in light and life “_language is so improved as to be symbolic of concepts as well as to be expressive of ideas_” ([UB 55:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/55#p5_6)).

In respect of today's civilization, we are told that “_there is a great need for further linguistic development to facilitate the expression of evolving thought_” ([UB 81:6.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_16)).

The revelators explained the great difficulty they had in compiling the Urantia papers due to the paucity of our language, and consequently I forgive them for utilizing language that embraced concepts as well as being expressive of ideas. They would have had an impossible job had they not. And so I read the beautiful blue book, am struck with awe at its wisdom; my mind pulsates with the truth of it all, but when I sit down and ask myself what exactly they said, I have not a clue.

I reach for the dictionary, dissecting every word in a sentence and then try to piece it back together, but it results in something less than the revelators' concept. It is as if each pearl of wisdom is beyond my grasp. I recognize this, and it is so darned frustrating.

> “_Religion is man's supreme experience in the mortal nature, but finite language makes it forever impossible for theology ever adequately to depict real religious experience._” ([UB 196:3.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_28))

I suspect that I may have to resign myself to the problem of quantifying concepts and my experience, linguistically, this side of Paradise!

It is as if _The URANTIA Book_ looks as if it is written in English. It utilizes words such as I can find in the dictionary, and when it coins words or phrases due to our vocabulary being inadequate, it explains the meaning. And then the resemblance ceases when I try to understand a sentence. It is not the words they use, it is the way they use them. I am fast coming to the conclusion that _The URANTIA Book_ is one big conceptual parable. As I grow in understanding, the book means something different, it acquires a depth that it lacked at the last reading. To be more precise it has things in it which it did not have before. And yet I know this is impossible, and hence as I grow, it seems to cater for that growth, in the further depth of understanding I will obtain due to its beautiful, linguistically exquisite use of our language. As an example of what I mean, and my attendant problem:

> “_The teachings of Jesus are really applicable to a mortal world which has had the preliminary training of the pre-bestowal Sons with their dispensations of character ennoblement and culture augmentation._” ([UB 52:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p5_8))

I nod so wisely, understanding why I cannot understand what Jesus says, then dread of realization strikes my timid heart. The revelators felt I was ready for a crash course in “character ennoblement” and “culture augmentation”, and so I was given _The URANTIA Book_. And so I must mentally add these characteristics to the list of necessary pre-requisites to living as Jesus and our Father would wish.

I so want the teachings of Jesus to be applicable to me that I am determined to ennoble my character and augment my culture, but where do I start? A somewhat wiser student of the blue book these days, I am learning to sense when I should turn to the dictionary, and when I must seek definitions within _The URANTIA Book_. I have a strong suspicion that the word character means something vastly different to the authors of the blue book, than it does to us Urantians. The higher schools of the Local Universe are devoted to

> “_character acquired by enlightened experience. The teachers provide the enlightenment; the universe station and the ascender's status afford the opportunity for experience; the wise utilization of these two augments character._” ([UB 37:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p6_3))

Courage coupled with patient endurance is regarded as strength of character; fear and anger weaken it; it is something more than mere mind and morals. Whereas “_personality is basically changeless; that which changes —grows—is the moral character_”. ([UB 140:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p4_7))

One thing is for sure — “_under the spiritual influences of these ages (post-bestowal Son age), human character undergoes tremendous transformations and experiences phenomenal development_”. ([UB 52:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p5_8))

Maybe I am okay, perhaps Michael's Spirit of Truth has character ennobled me. I might have unconsciously undergone a tremendous transformation of human character at birth, purely because of his spiritual influence. I hope so, because otherwise I am going to have to wait until I get to the mansion worlds to understand what character ennoblement is, let alone what I do to get it. So onto the other quality — the cultural augmentation.

When it comes to cultural augmentation, which culture am I supposed to augment? I verily suspect the culture of a universal citizen:

> “_Intelligence may control the mechanism of civilization, wisdom may direct it, but spiritual idealism is the energy which really uplifts and advances human culture from one level of attainment to another._” ([UB 81:6.27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/81#p6_27))

Now when I piece all of the sources of explanation on the concepts of “character ennoblement and cultural augmentation”, of which the above represent a trifling percentage of the information provided on these topics in _The URANTIA Book_, my poor brain overloads, and every inch of me wants to relegate myself to the “peculiar character” category. Just when it all seems too much, I smile and thank God that He has given me a Thought Adjuster to sort all of these acquirements. All I have to do is attune my will to our Father's will. The way, the why and the how will be explained at the appropriate time.

The more I study _The URANTIA Book_ the more I appreciate that my intellect cannot absorb the information contained. I cannot produce a list of acquirements and strive valiantly towards their attainment, for the book is full of concepts, linguistic symbols, which my heart knows (thanks to Michael's Spirit of Truth), but my Thought Adjuster is going to have an uphill battle in trying to get through the mind of this child of the twentieth century. But of one thing I am sure — God wants the teachings of Jesus to be applicable to me, and so it is up to me to leave myself open, willing and desirous of being character ennobled and culturally augmented.

## The Forum

### The Message is Spreading

_Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

A recently published book entitled “Jesus, A New Vision” by Marcus J. Borg (Harper Collins) may be an indication that the message of _The URANTIA Book_ is having a considerable direct or indirect influence in academic circles. It may also portend that great things are about to happen in the Christian churches.

Borg is a professor of religious studies at Oregon State University and the author of several academic studies relating to Jesus. This book is written for a wider readership and has some quite startling revelations. In it Borg announces that the risen Christ who came to die for the sins of the world was an invention of the early church and was never preached by Jesus himself. He calls this the popular image of Jesus, as still preached in the mainstream churches, and states that it is seriously misleading.

That this image is inaccurate, Borg says, is a bedrock conclusion arrived at by mainstream New Testament scholarship that commenced as far back as the seventeenth century, accelerating in the nineteenth and twentieth. “Mainstream biblical scholarship,” he states, “is the approach to Scripture taught in the seminaries of the mainstream churches. It is the product of using an historical method on the books of the New Testament, treating them as human documents rather than as divine documents guaranteed to be infallible by God.”

Borg tells us that the image of Jesus as taught in the seminaries for most of this century is that Jesus saw himself as a prophet who came to proclaim the end of the world in his own time and therefore preached the urgency for repentance before it was too late.

Primarily this concept of Jesus (the eschatological image) had its origin with the work of Albert Schweitzer which, though at first branded as sensational, gradually became the consensus understanding among scholars. That the clergy of the mainstream churches (which include Roman Catholics, Presbyterians, Methodists, United Church of Christ, Disciples of Christ, Episcopalians, the majority of Lutherans, and some Baptists) have been taught that Jesus saw himself in this way is indeed a revelation to lay people. The fact that the clergy has not passed the message on to the laity appears to be because they could find no satisfactory substitute for the popular image of the sacrificial Christ who died to pay for our sins.

In the light of this information it seems that many, perhaps most, clergy, have for long been preaching a message that they themselves did not believe. Is it any wonder that the numbers in church congregations has plummeted? The clergy are faced with presenting a lameduck Christianity. When mainstream clergy do preach about Jesus, Borg says, they tend to emphasize the “kerygma” — the message of the early church about Jesus and not the historical Jesus himself, concerning whom they are strangely silent.

An interesting comparison is made between what Borg calls the “reality” for the times of Jesus and the modern era. This is the total sociological environment in which we grow up and more or less unconsciously absorb into our thought patterns. Virtually all of our life experiences are then interpreted in terms of that “reality”. In Jesus' time, and up to quite recently, it was normal to accept that our “reality” included the existence of that “other world”, the world of spirit co-existing with our material world and contactable by holy men, prophets, shamans, mystics, charismatics and so on. In the modern world the norm is to reject the existence of this “other world” and to interpret everything in terms of what can be experienced objectively and directly. This attitude is often unconscious — we reject things out of hand that do not fit our “reality”.

> ...Borg Announces That The Risen Christ Who Came To Die For The Sins Of The world was an invention of the early church and was never preached by Jesus himself.

Borg makes no attempt to prove the divinity of Jesus but concentrates on Jesus, the man, and what Jesus believed about God. In so doing, he presents a vision of a Jesus that could be acceptable to both mainstream and “fringe” Christians and perhaps to many who have previously been non-committal. This Jesus is portrayed as one who was remarkably in touch with that “other world”, a charismatic, a healer, a teacher and sage, a prophet, the founder of a revitalization movement, a challenge. Jesus is also presented as an epiphany of God, who discloses that at the centre of everything is a reality that is in love with us and wills our well being, both as individuals and as individuals within society. To Jesus, says Borg, “reality” was ultimately Spirit, a gracious, nurturing, and compassionate God, Creator of all things, by whom and in whom everything exists.

This book contains a multitude of references that indicate a new movement is emerging in the world of religious scholasticism that has the potential to turn the Christian world upside down. Its approach to religion and to Jesus is reasonable and rational. The very nature of the God it presents is one that carries within itself an automatic correcting mechanism for most of the inconsistencies of conventional Christianity. There is also an awareness that the popular modern world view of “reality” is flawed, that purely materialist science has been judged as false by the findings of theoretical physics.

Of course this does not prove the truth of the religious world view, but it does undermine the central reason for rejecting it.

There are many parallels between Borg's work and _The URANTIA Book_ in respect to the teachings of and about Jesus. Borg describes Jesus as a remarkably free person, freẹ from fear and anxious preoccupation, thus able to see clearly and to love. This freedom was grounded in the Spirit, from which flowed the other central qualities of his life: courage, insight, joy, and above all compassion, all these being the “fruits of the Spirit.” Borg says that what we can know about Jesus invites us to see “life in the Spirit” as a striking alternative to the way we typically live our lives. He states that as an epiphany of God, Jesus was a “disclosure” or “revelation” of God. Jesus did not reveal God only in his teaching but in his very way of being.

Borg describes Jesus as a remarkably free person, free from fear and anxious preoccupation, thus able to see clearly and to love. This freedom was grounded in the Spirit, from which flowed the other central qualities of his life: courage, insight, joy, and above all compassion, all these being the “fruits of the Spirit”.

Just how much _The URANTIA Book_ and its teachings have contributed either directly or indirectly to this “new vision of Jesus” is something we will never know. It is doubtful that this will bother the midwayers who wrote:

> “_The time is ripe to witness the figurative resurrection of the human Jesus from his burial tomb amidst the theological traditions and the religious dogmas of nineteen centuries. Jesus of Nazareth must no longer be sacrificed to even the splendid concept of the glorified Christ. What a transcendent service if, through this revelation, the Son of Man should be recovered from the tomb of traditional theology and be presented as the living Jesus to the church that bears his name, and to all other religions!_” ([UB 196:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_2))

It is unlikely that Borg's work will be read by significant numbers outside of the academic community, hence it will take a long, long time for this new vision to permeate down through the seminaries to the general congregations of the churches. However, as _The URANTIA Book_ tells us, patience is a virtue and slow evolution is more productive than disruptive revolution. But URANTIA Book readers might well consider giving Borg's book as a present to some of their non-reader, church-going friends.

## The Book Study \& Discussion

### The Adventures Of Jesus Of Nazareth

_[In the previous issue of Six-O-Six, it was announced that our editorial panel is attempting to put together a work having the aim of bringing the teachings of Jesus, as revealed in _The URANTIA Book_, to non-readers. Contributions were solicited, perhaps a chapter, but even a plot to go along with your favorite teaching could be a help. The story should be “fictional” but the teachings are expected to have a firm foundation in the book itself._

_In the review of Borg's book, “Jesus: A New Vision” in the previous article, you will appreciate that the Christian laity is in desperate need of the true teachings of Jesus. Although Borg has done a marvelous job in presenting the human Jesus in a persuasive but non-confrontational manner, his book is unlikely to reach many of the laity. The purpose of our “Adventures” is gap-filling — to bring _The URANTIA Book_ teachings of and about Jesus to the Christian laity now._

_The story that follows is part of a potential chapter of our “Adventures” and is presented to act as a guide to what we hope to accomplish. Jesus is accompanying Jayant, a merchant, on a journey in the Mediterranean area, acting as an interpreter for Jayant and also a tutor to his son, Sardri. The departure of their boat to Alexandria has been delayed.]_

The next morning they received news that the departure of the boat would be delayed because one of its huge steering paddles was in danger of cleaving. Jesus and Sardri went down to the boat and talked with the captain who was now distraught because he was unable to obtain skilled woodworkers to repair the paddle. Jesus told the captain of his experience both as a woodworker and in boat building and volunteered his services — to which the captain agreed gratefully.

The foreman of the maintenance gang servicing the boat soon realized the Jesus was more capable than himself or his gang of doing the work on the steering paddle. As soon as it had been propped in a satisfactory position for the repairs to be carried out, Jesus was allocated a slave-boy named Xanand and left to do this work while the remainder of the gang did other essential work. The boat had been beached at high tide and propped to stabilize it. The base of the paddle rested on the sand and a scaffold held the top section. Jesus and Xanand worked on a platform on the scaffolding.

Jesus soon discovered that Xanand was very embittered at the kind of treatment he received from the foreman. Jesus' attitude to Xanand was entirely different from anything the boy had experienced previously. It was as if Jesus was Xanand's brother rather than a master who had the right to do with him as he chose. They talked together while they worked, becoming firm and cooperative friends. For the first time in his life, Xanand began to enjoy and take a pride in the work he was doing. He also became curious as to why Jesus treated him so. Finally his curiosity became greater than his wariness and he asked directly why Jesus was so good to him.

Xanand was amazed when Jesus said, “Xanand, you are my brother. We are all God's children and our heavenly Father makes no distinction between kings and slaves.” There followed a long discussion on the nature of this heavenly Father. Xanand had received no education of any kind, knowing only what he could gather from his limited contact with the society in which he lived. For him there were many Gods, none of which had any interest at all in mere slaves. A God who was interested in him as a person, who looked upon and loved him as his child, who was looking to help him grow spiritually, who sought to nurture rather than punish, all these were strange and almost unbelievable ideas to Xanand.

Over the next three days, Xanand questioned Jesus unendingly about God, about the nature of good and evil, about sin, and particularly why such a wonderful God allowed people like Xanand to become slaves to cruel and unjust masters such as his foreman. Jesus told Xanand that God does not make us slaves or kings, mankind does that of its own freewill. But Xanand had great difficulty in understanding why God did not intervene to prevent the foreman treating him badly. He did not expect the reply he received from Jesus.

“Xanand, since you have now been introduced to the ways of love and of kindness and you have learned to value justice, perhaps God has brought you and this foreman together so that you may show him, through your own example, that there is a better way. You cannot overcome evil with evil, but it is indeed possible to overcome evil with good. Devote your life to returning good for evil. You will sometimes be amazed at the result. You will not always appear to succeed, sometimes it will appear that you can never succeed. This world is a growing place for souls. Often when you are most disappointed and you think that your best efforts have been a total failure, unknowingly you will have sown a seed that will ultimately bear fruit.”

“Xanand, I have absolute confidence in my heavenly Father's overcare; I am consecrated to doing his will. Hence I do not believe that real harm can befall me. Though my body could be destroyed, my soul would always be safe, and that is what really matters. I am absolutely assured that the real universe is friendly to me — and this all-powerful truth I insist on believing with total trust in God in spite of any appearances to the contrary.”

“At present, this foreman you call evil is your master in that you allow his evil ways to upset you. Why not assert your mastery over evil by virtue of the power of goodness?”

In this way you become the master of all relations between the two of you. Give it a fair try and I know that the good in you can overcome the evil in him — perhaps not today or even while you are still together — but eventually good will be triumphant. Since you are more blessed with the light of truth than is your foreman, his great need should challenge you. Surely you are not the coward who could stand by and watch a fellow man who could not swim, drown. How much more of value is this man's soul, drowning in darkness and evil, compared to his earthly body drowning in water?"

> “How Much More Of Value Is This Man's Soul, Drowning In Darkness And Evil, compared to his earthly body drowning in water.”

It was soon after this discussion that the work on the steering paddle was completed. The time was late in the afternoon and the men were beginning to depart to their homes or their lodgings. Jesus signalled to the foreman who then came over to inspect the work, finding that it had been done superbly. He knew that Jesus was a paying passenger on the boat, not a hired workman but one who had volunteered his services. Thus Jesus was treated with a respect that the foreman did not normally show to those under him. After being thanked for his help, Jesus said goodbye to Xanand and departed for the inn.

The foreman was being paid a bonus for getting the maintenance work completed to a tight schedule. Although the light was failing he worked on so as to get the remaining work finished early the following morning. Xanand was sent to the fore of the vessel to clean up while the foreman commenced to hurriedly dissemble the scaffolding supporting the huge and heavy steering paddle. In his hurry, he made an error of judgement and brought the paddle crashing down upon himself thus pinning him to the sand. His right leg was broken, he received a blow to the side of the head and lost consciousness.

Xanand witnessed the accident and ran to the rear of the vessel expecting to be told what to do. He called to the foreman and received no reply. Then he noticed that the tide was coming in quite rapidly, that within perhaps half an hour it would flow over the head of the hated foreman. The bitterness over the abusive and violent treatment that he had experienced at the hands of this man overwhelmed him. Nobody else was around, nobody had seen what had happened, there was almost no chance that anyone would find the pinned and injured man before he was drowned by the incoming tide. And even if that happened there was nobody to say that he had witnessed the accident. If he left now and said nothing, no-one would ever know the truth.

Xanand concluded that was how it should be. Quickly he made his departure taking care not to be seen and hurried towards the shabby huts where slaves such as himself had to find food and shelter for the night. He thought of Jesus, the only person that he could remember in his whole life who had ever said or done anything decent to him. This man, a Jew, had even shared his food with him, a lowly, worthless slave. Jews did not share food with gentiles, let alone with a gentile slave. The vision of those kindly, caring eyes, that friendly voice, the wisdom, the patience and the love he had been shown haunted Xanand as he scurried in the shadows towards his lodgings. What were those last words — “How much more of value is this man's soul, drowning in darkness and evil, compared to his earthly body drowning in water.”

Xanand carried on but more words came back, “Surely you are not the coward who could stand by and watch a fellow man who could not swim, drown; since you are more blessed with the light of truth than is your foreman, his great need should challenge you.” Xanand turned and ran to the inn where he knew Jesus was staying. Unthinkingly he rushed into the dining area, sought out Jesus at table with Jayant and Sardri and blurted out what had happened.

> “Getting to know your newly-acquired brothers and sisters, getting to share their problems and their joys, learning to love each of them as a member of your own family is the supreme experience of living.”

Jesus knew that there would be no time to summon help, that if the foreman was to be saved they had to go immediately. Jayant understood and the four of them ran from the inn to the vessel. When they arrived water was already lapping around the head of the foreman who was still unconscious. Others who had seen the four running to the vessel came over out of curiosity. Soon there were enough of them to use some of the scaffolding to lever the paddle upwards while the foreman was dragged from beneath. A crude stretcher was made from scaffolding timbers and sail canvas so that the now half-conscious foreman could be taken to a nearby doctor.

Jesus told Xanand to come to the inn early the next morning and together they went to visit the foreman whose leg had now been set and who was fully conscious. He remembered only that he had been dissembling the scaffolding. Jesus filled him in on the details, emphasizing that it was Xanand who was entirely responsible for him still being alive. Then, with a few kind parting words, Jesus left Xanand and the foreman together.

The foreman was aware that his treatment of Xanand had been exceptionally bad, even by the low standards of his society for treatment of slaves. He was puzzled by the fact that Xanand had saved his life. Conscious of his status Xanand stood mute, awaiting instructions on what he should do now that his master was bed-ridden. He was also disconcerted when the foreman looked him in the eyes and asked why Xanand had saved his life.

Not knowing what else to do, Xanand told the foreman everything that he could remember of Jesus' talk with him on the previous day. Finally he repeated those words of Jesus that had induced him to seek help, “How much more of value is this man's soul, drowning in darkness and evil, compared to his earthly body drowning in water.” The foreman was mightily moved by Jesus' words. He asked Xanand to try to get Jesus to visit him once more before the boat sailed for Alexandria. Xanand was able to arrange this meeting. An eventual outcome was that Xanand was given his freedom. Many years later both of these men, one formerly a ex-Greek slave and now a builder, the other now a Roman building contractor, would become prominent in the Christian church that would be founded in Caesarea by the disciple, Philip.

On route to Alexandria, Sardri asked Jesus why he took so much interest in people who were comparative strangers and of lowly status in life. Jesus answered, “Sardri, no one is a stranger, nor do they have lowly status, to one who knows God. In finding God, you will also discover that all men and women are your brothers and sisters. Getting to know your newly-acquired brothers and sisters, getting to share their problems and their joys, learning to love each of them as a member of your own family is the supreme experience of living.”

During this discussion which lasted well into the night, Sardri had noted that Jesus often stated that the supreme purpose of living is to do the will of God and asked how he could know God's will for him. Jesus replied, “The will of God is the way of God and the way of God reflects the nature of God. At the present stage of our progress along the pathway to our attainment of God's presence, it is best to think of God as a heavenly Father who wills the utmost cosmic good for each of his children. Hence we can best do the will of God by willing for our brothers and sisters what we believe our heavenly Father would will for them. Our Father is one who is gracious, nurturing, and compassionate in all his dealings with his earthly children, and whose love as a Father transcends his righteousness as a judge. You do the will of God when, to the best of your ability, your elect to treat your brothers and sisters in like manner.” Sardri's respect for his teacher-companion was steadily growing into a state of loving devotion that would ultimately be boundless.

### Reflecting On Evangelizing

As a young man, Vincent J. Donovan burned with a desire to spread the gospel of Jesus. He was ordained in the Roman Catholic Church and sent to the Masai people of Tanzania as a missionary. The one hundred year old mission station consisted of a church, a school, and a hospital. It did a fine job in bringing education and medicine to those who attended. Some even went to church services. But it made no progress in evangelizing the nomadic herdsman of the Masai tribe.

Fr. Donovan was an unusual priest. He was a great admirer of St. Paul's missionary endeavors. The Masai people live in small tightly-structured communities with their cattle. They build a kraal , a circular village of mud huts, then burn everything and move on when the pastures run out. Fr. Donovan soon realized that to convert an individual to Christianity would make him an outcast from his community. But Fr. Donovan found that the people were willing to listen to him as a community.

Though they were illiterate pagans, these people had a well-developed culture that was highly adapted to their way of life. They even believed in a far away God. Fr. Donovan realized that the doctrines and dogma of westernized Christianity would make no sense to the Masai. So he taught them what Jesus had taught his disciples about God. He taught them about the nature of God, using parables like the lost sheep, the lost coin, the prodigal son, the good Samaritan, and quotations from the Sermon on the Mount. That was all he taught them. Like Paul, he left it to them to formulate their own prayers, their own ways of worship, their own liturgies. With no ordained priests!

Fr. Donovan was remarkably successful. He tells his story in a book entitled “Christianity Re-discovered. An Epistle from the Masai.” (SCM Press, London). It is a text book of common sense in the art of evangelizing.

How do we spread the message of _The URANTIA Book_? Jesus did not tell us to give people the book. What he said was:

> “_Go, then, into all the world proclaiming the gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men to all nations and races and ever be wise in your choice of methods for presenting the good news to the different races and tribes of mankind._” ([UB 191:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p4_4))

Perhaps Fr. Donovan's book might inspire some of us to figure out ways of taking the simple gospel of Jesus, as it is presented in _The URANTIA Book_, to the non-Christian countries of the world. Most of these peoples could not read _The URANTIA Book_ anyway. And also to the many semi-pagan sub-cultures that have sprung up in the Western world. Most of these people could read the book, but would not, even if it was given to them. Neither would the Masai. But something worked for them.

### I Hear It Was Charged Against Me

_Walt Whitman, 1860_

<p style="text-align:center;">
<em>I hear it was charged against me</em><br>
<em>that I want to destroy institutions,</em><br>
<em>But really I am neither for nor against institutions.</em><br>
<em>What indeed have I in common with them?</em><br>
<em>or what with the destruction of them?</em><br>
<em>Only I will establish in the Mannahatta</em><br>
<em>and in every city of these States</em><br>
<em>inland and seaboard</em><br>
<em>And in the fields and woods, </em><br>
<em>and above every keel little or large</em><br>
<em>that dents the water,</em><br>
<em>Without edifices or rules or trustees</em><br>
<em>or any argument,</em><br>
<em>The institution of the dear love of comrades.</em><br>
