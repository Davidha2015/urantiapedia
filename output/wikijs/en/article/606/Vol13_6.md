## Editor's Notebook

The way to success for a religious book for a long time now has depended on its packaging.

But today more than ever it's the packaging of instant appeal, power of impact, the non-participating aspect, mass media, and peer pressure.

How does _The URANTIA Book_ stack up in that context? At best, it has power of impact for some.

Our youth generally are put off by their parents' churches. With Jesus' teachings so deeply buried, they are jettisoned with all else in favour of a group which better communicates its central message. Such as the charismatic theme. Or an easy to follow cult.

Children find a sprinkling of religion in schools, sporting groups, and youth organizations such as Scouts. But it is a side issue and perhaps rightly so.

The way is left wide open for the influences of their music and their television. Still not a book in sight. Society is unable to counter the effect. Surrealism struggles to stay ahead of advancing realism. Who needs religious values when a generation evolves their own! Not that I'm suggesting they be inhibited in their quest. Rather, where can they be contacted? Where do they find a peer or a book with the credentials of spiritual knowledge?

For that matter where do adults find them? Dame Iris Murdoch, in her newly published 500 pages of ‘Metaphysics as a Guide to Morals’ tells us: “God does not and cannot exist.”

But wait! _The URANTIA Book_ has taken root. There is a plan in God's vast domain.

He requires us to read the book, then act accordingly. Imagine not even bothering to read it, because of slothfulness and society's conditioning — tantamount to ignoring God.

Social security in the mail, fast food delivered, non-do TV sport, non-think magazines. A lotus land of shifting sand.

Try and package _The URANTIA Book_ for that world of effortless activity with its inherent stress factors.

I'm pleased to say the novelists and philosophers have already commenced, albeit by default.

In their chipping away of orthodoxy, they have few stones left to turn or throw.

They see the possibility of Christianity — reduced now to its uppers — disappearing, but only because their exploration of it has left them nowhere to go — atheism by the process of elimination.

Separate speculation about Jesus, by writers such as Wilson (Jesus) and Thiering (Jesus the man), indicate a world now bereft of evolutionary spiritual progress. Literal truth must be stabilized and clarified by revelation.

Our image of Christ is faltering. The key element is to see a fuller concept of Jesus and his teachings, one separate from the churches. And to see Jesus as a master creator distinct from other religious teachers. All confusion and disillusion shall then unravel like wrapping paper.

As for packaging _The URANTIA Book_'s teachings, well, that's not a problem. Beyond the images of Jesus, drawn from the American movies, from smooth darkhaired Oriental performers, from pop culture, from Byzantine and post-Renaissance European art, there is a perfect communicator. The Spirit of Truth.

Facile and tactile, but to the soul.

## So They Say

**Peter Mayer (Penguin Books)**

What is special about a book is what is inside it, not the physical object itself.

**Weekend Australian**

Another important question raised by Leakey and Lewin (‘Origins Reconsidered’) is whether present-day humans had single or multiple origins. Did the prehuman to human transition occur in several different places? Or are modern humans the result of just one such transition? If we are all products of one overwhelmingly successful transition, then we are in a sense all of one great family.

**Laurie Kavanagh (Brisbane Courier Mail)**

Some ratbag wants to rewrite the Bible's version of the Last Supper. There were no women at the table, you see. Personally I couldn't care less if it was an all-women Last Supper with Christ a woman instead of a bloke. What difference does it make? And it wouldn't matter if he or she was black, brown, brindle, or pink. If you want to believe in that sort of thing what does it matter. Christ was Christ.

**Third World Bulletin**

The ranks of the Protestant fundamentalist groups in the Philippines have grown enormously and now provide a threat to the stature of the Catholic Church.

There are now more than 1600 of these groups with a congregation of 1.6 million. A suggested reason for these new churches is the failure of the Catholic religion to provide meaning to the life and faith of its community in today's society.

## Letters To The Editor

### Paperback Worthwhile

_Audrey Morris, Tewantin, Queensland_

I agree with Keith Bacon of Victoria regarding a paperback edition of the fourth Section of _The URANTIA Book_.

The message of Jesus was always a simple one, understood by all, and we should make that simple message available to all. Wouldn't a paperback edition make a great Christmas present!!

### Challenge The Book's Teachings

_Allan E.L. Lane, Mirrabooka, Western Australia_

Please encourage and publish articles which question the accuracy of _the URANTIA Book_ teachings. I am keen for this, not to weaken spiritual growth, but to strengthen it.

I believe in rigorously examining the teachings of any source claiming to be a higher than human authority. A strong spotlight should be kept trained on all of _The URANTIA Book_'s claims, including reincarnation theory, the statistics on personality survival, and so on. In my opinion, if the book is all it claims to be, it will only benefit in the longer term from intense and ongoing questioning regarding its claims concerning the nature of reality and existence.

I think the new-look Six-O-Six is great!

### Oops

In the last issue of Six-O-Six, paragraph 6 of Allan Lane's article, “Ignore the Channellers?” should have read:

“The point I am trying to make here is that one day, post 1935 , if not already, higher authorities may communicate a small or large amount of excellent information or advice for public consumption via someone contemporary.”

The words in bold were mistakenly omitted. Our apologies.

## News Around The World

### New Service To Contributors

To facilitate early publication of letters and articles, your contributions may be faxed to Ann Bendall on (074) 491817 or to Ken Glasziou via Compuserve.

### Clarification Of Foundation's Book Policy

The URANTIA Foundation will sell to an individual if they do not have access to a bookstore. However, these sales will be transacted at the suggested retail price, plus shipping and handling.

### A Disease Called Happiness

A recent edition of ‘NewScientist’ includes a proposition by distinguished psychologist Richard Bentall of the University of Liverpool to classify happiness as a psychiatric disorder.

Happiness, he argues, must be irrational in a world as wicked as this, and therefore happy people are apt to behave in a manner incompatible with the true interests of themselves and society at large.

It must be treated, apparently, so “we can expect the emergence of happiness clinics and anti-happiness medications in the not too distant future”.

We could almost be forgiven for deciding this to be a very sad state of affairs. Keep watching the World Health Organization's International Classification of Diseases for further details.

### Exploration Closer To Home

Scientists have also reported detecting a powerful object only two million light-years from the Milky Way galaxy, by using the Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer.

The object appeared to be an elliptical galaxy radiating as much energy as a trillion suns.

### The Bleep Goes On (Even Closer)

A ten-year NASA Program will probe the faintest of radio signals suggesting intelligence on other planets. The world's largest radio telescope in Puerto Rico will conduct a “targeted search”, probing 1000 stars similar to the sun within 100 light-years of earth. (One light year is about 14 trillion kilometres.)

Incoming data will be processed using computers. Any possible signal will be verified to ensure they are not coming from earth or a hoax. The body of evidence suggests the events that led to the formation of earth are fairly common. As Cornell University Astronomer, Mr Carl Sagan, said: “For us to have the capability to seek out other civilizations and not to do so would be a great mistake. We have a chance to probe with rigor and in detail, one of the great questions: ”Are we alone?"'

### Dark Secret Exposed

The Hubble space telescope has photographed an unusual mirror-image of a distant galaxy that may help astronomers understand more about mysterious ‘dark matter’. The image appeared through a huge cluster of galaxies located at about four billion light-years from earth. Two six-hour exposures of the cluster showed the pair of faint objects with structures of perfect symmetry.

### Summary Of Elanora Conference 1992

_Kathleen Swadling, Sydney_

Another annual conference for students of _the URANTIA Book_ has come and gone leaving all who participated, I'm sure, with a feeling that their time was well spent and full of qualitative experiences and reflection. Over the four days, around thirty to thirty-five people attended, some staying and others visiting on a daily basis. We had folks come all the way from the USA, New Zealand, Victoria, Queensland and NSW. New and old friends were met and much meaningful and valuable sharing took place.

The theme was ‘Human Nature and the Twelve Apostles’. Twelve people were previously selected to study up on the nature and character of an apostle and presented that apostle to the group. The Women's Corps was also presented.

The objective was to try and gain an understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of human beings, especially ones who were desperately trying to grasp the significance of Jesus' teachings The struggles they encountered when attempting to understand and apply the truths gleaned through their association with Jesus, coupled with their background of culture, preconceived ideas and expectations, highlighted the frailties and limitations of human understanding. The magnificent trust and faith Jesus had in them, despite these failings, was, and is, an inspiration to anyone struggling with their own shortcomings.

By studying each of these apostles, we were able to see a cross-section of the types of people throughout human society. Many a time throughout the presentations the presenter would exclaim that they felt they were doing a study on themselves and felt they had learned a lot through this exercise. The diversity of these twelve was profound and yet they were given the task of working together in the business of epochal revelation. This realization stimulated much discussion on the necessity of understanding one another in order that we may have tolerance and patience and be able to work together for a common high goal.

Rita Schaad, from Newcastle, brought along the framework for a woven wall hanging and explained the symbology of her intentions. She asked if, throughout the weekend, we could all contribute to this wall hanging by weaving in some of the material she provided and also to use our imaginations if we felt inclined to collect other material from the surrounding bush and weave this in also. This would result in a symbolization of how the harmonious interweaving of individuality can produce something solid, firm and beautiful. It symbolized the tapestry of life which fitted into the theme of human nature beautifully. I'd like to thank Rita for this symbolic gesture from the bottom of my heart. It brings alive for me the astounding truth of how much more useful we can all be when working our diverse individuality in with the individuality of others instead of it working against one another and the greater cause.

On Sunday afternoon, Seppo Kanerva presented an outline for the structure of the new URANTIA Brotherhood Association. Seppo is from the Finnish URANTIA Society and is currently working in the office of URANTIA Foundation on translations of _The URANTIA Book_. This outline was well presented by Seppo and stimulated many thoughts and questions on the direction this new organization will take. In a nutshell, the new organization will be more geared toward coordination rather than organization and will be concerned primarily with providing service to students of the book if they wish for that service. The study group will be considered autonomous with that autonomy respected at all times. The study group will be outside of the structure even though the structure will be able to provide services to those groups if asked. The structure will be a lot simpler than its predecessor, URANTIA Brotherhood, in the hope that service to the organization does not take the place of service to students of _The URANTIA Book_. If anyone would like a copy of the booklet which was handed out titled ‘URANTIA Brotherhood Association — Structure Outline’ let me know by writing to PO Box 609, Narrabeen, NSW, 2101.

Saturday night saw us all at the Singaporean Restaurant for dinner where a good time was had in relaxation and socialization. On Sunday afternoon we took a stroll along some of the headlands of Sydney's northern beaches and walked around some rock pools and along the beach. The weather was kind and the scenery picturesque. The company was fantastic! Sunday night was quiz time hosted by Terry Hovaghimian and his lovely offsider, Maria (Jane King). We split up into teams and were asked questions from _The URANTIA Book_. Much debate, friendly arguing and stimulation resulted. Terry added much humour with his quick wit and showman abilities. Maria kept score as well as trying to keep the quiz master and the wild rabble under control!

Monday morning rounded the conference off nicely with a study group. We read paper 100 — ‘Religion in Human Experience’ which was very appropriate to the theme. Naturally much stimulating and thought- provoking discussion took place. It was sad when it came time to break up the party and all go our separate ways. I'm sure I speak for almost all when I say that the weekend helped us to experience the richness in genuine sharing amongst God-loving fellow men and women. These experiences are to be treasured and I hope the memories stay with us all for a long time.

### A Bibliographic Essay On Some Human Sources Used In _The Urantia Book_

_Matthew Block, Chicago_

> “_...in making these presentations about God and his universe associates, we have selected as the basis of these papers more than one thousand human concepts representing the highest and most advanced planetary knowledge of spiritual values and universe meanings._” ([UB 0:12.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_12))

> “_We may resort to pure revelation only when the concept of presentation has had no adequate previous expression by the human mind._” ([UB 0:12.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_11))

> “_The memoranda which I have collected...embrace thought gems and superior concepts of Jesus' teachings assembled from more than two thousand human beings who have lived on earth from the days of Jesus down to the times of the inditing of these revelations, more correctly restatements...the majority of the ideas and even some of the effective expressions which I have thus utilised had their origin in the men of many races who have lived on earth during the intervening generations, right on down to those who are still alive at the time of this undertaking._” ([UB 121:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_13))

Following these introductory remarks is a list of nineteen books which in all probability were used in the inditement of some of the Urantia Papers. Each of these books (with a few exceptions noted in the list) contains sentences, paragraphs or even whole chapters whose phrasings and organization of thoughts or information are so closely paralleled in _The URANTIA Book_ as to strongly suggest their use as source materials by the revelators. While a few of these have long been known to some URANTIA Book readers (e.g. the books by Breasted, Bundy, Jones), most were apparently first discovered in libraries and used book stores in the Chicago area during the spring, summer and fall of 1992 in the course of my research into _The URANTIA Book_'s human sources.

The research so far has been so fruitful mainly because none of the books were obscure; they were all written by authorities in their respective fields (often by professors from prominent American universities) and many were reviewed in the popular and academic press. Further, the book titles themselves are often giveaways to the alert URANTIA Book reader, by their very titles, for instance, I targetted ‘Purposive Evolution’ and ‘The Architecture of the Universe’ (listed below) as likely primary sources.

It is interesting to note that, while these books cover many fields, including religion, philosophy, archaeology, physics, astronomy and history, the revelators directly acknowledge using only the highest human concepts and insights pertaining to God and the seven superuniverses and to the life and teachings of Jesus as the above quotations attest. I was thus quite surprised, initially, at the extent to which the revelators culled from books which do not focus on these areas. But, regardless of the lack of specific acknowledgements, it is clear that many more textual sources (both direct and indirect) in various fields will eventually be traced. I estimate that writings published before 1936 form the basis of at least two-thirds of Part III and IV, and most of these works will probably be found within the next few years. Eventually we will be able to map out the whole URANTIA Book according to which parts were apparently revealed for the first time and which were not. And, again, this will not be too difficult since the revelators, while avoiding extensive word-for-word borrowings, made no attempt to disguise their sources by departing widely from the original human expressions.

Clearly, these findings are of great importance to serious URANTIA Book readers. In addition to providing further substantiation of the revelators' acknowedgements, they spark new insights into what this revelation really is and how human and superhuman voices and viewpoints interfaced in its production. As we gain a better grasp of how original it is (in its function of pure revelation), and how derivative (in its function of presenting superhuman restatements of human concepts and expressions), we will be better able to see how the revelation positions itself with regard to evolutionary human knowledge, wisdom, and faith.

My own experience has taught me that, as a result of my ignorance and underestimation of early 20th century thought, my sense of this positioning has been skewed. If unfamiliar with a concept or a piece of information presented in the papers — especially if it struck me as uncommonly beautiful, brilliant or incisive — I would automatically assume it was revealed for the first time, little realising that it might have been common knowledge, in some form or other, to some Urantians of earlier generations. But in becoming more familiar with thought trends of that period and others, and with the discovery of more human sources, I've come to a better appreciation of the higher reaches of human thought (as reflected in the book) and can now begin to give the book's human side its proper due. Moreover, I now have added resources at my disposal when attempting to share URANTIA Book teachings with people| ‘not ready’ for the book itself.

These initial findings have already convinced me of two things. First, while no longer equating ‘revelation’ with complete superhuman originality, I have no doubt that The Urantia Papers were superhumanly ‘indited’. Each of the books below was deftly and creatively used, so as to seamlessly integrate human observations with revelatory supplementation or correction. Thus, to give just one example, the adjutant mind spirits of worship and wisdom are incorporated into ‘The Origins of Worship’ paper, a paper which is very largely derived from the ‘Origin and Evolution of Religion’ (see below), whose author held to a wholly natural motivation of the worship urge.

Second, rather than being an embarrassment to _The URANTIA Book_'s credibility as a revelation, these books are of great help in the further understanding of the papers which use them. Often the revelators are obliged to present an abbreviated treatment of a concept or a history which is discussed at greater length by the human source. For instance, my understanding of the book's puzzling reference to ‘cosmic self-maintenance’ (482) was greatly enhanced when I came upon this concept presented at length in the Noble book (see below). In the light of these benefits to comprehension, of both content and context, I feel it would be helpful for the readership to be made aware of these sources, and perhaps some of these books with expired copyrights could be republished. Further, as an organization dedicated to furthering the study of _The URANTIA Book_, The Fellowship would do well to openly acknowledge the existence of these works in some way, perhaps even in our informational literature about _The URANTIA Book_. We should be aware, as well, that a confident and wellreasoned acknowledgement would disarm debunkers who hold the notion that revelation always and necessarily means, to its gulled believers, complete superhuman inspiration.

> ...While No Longer Equating ‘Revelation’ With <Br> Complete Superhuman originality, I have no doubt that The URANTIA Papers were superhumanly ‘indited’.

The following list is necessarily brief and incomplete. In the coming months I intend to analyze some of these books at greater length, detailing the often ingenious ways the revelators make use of them. My main goals in each of the essays, which I hope to publish in various movement journals and newsletters will be: (1) To lay out the parallels between the book in question and _The URANTIA Book_, (2) To show how the superhuman presenters supplemented the human statements with revelatory information or insights, and (3) To see whether and how the book in question sheds light on the corresponding passages in _The URANTIA Book_. In the meantime, I and other readers will continue to be on the lookout for more human sources. If anyone knows of books or writings not included in this list, I would be grateful to hear from you. If anyone has any questions about these books or the projects, please feel free to contact me at:

_Chicago, IL 60613 (312/975 1764)._

**1. Aston, W.G., 1905, ‘Shinto:The Way Of The Gods’ (Longmans, Green \& Co., New York).**

Paper 131, ‘The World’s Religions‘, Section 7. Sentences from Aston's translation of the ‘Wa Rongo’ collection of Shinto oracles, lightly rewritten or paraphrased, constitute the entire selection of Ganid's abstract of Shinto.

**2. Bishop, William Samuel, 1926, ‘The Theology Of Personality’ (Longmans, Green and Co., New York).**

Foreword, Section XII; Paper 106, ‘Universe Levels of Reality’, Section 8. Although there appears to be no superhuman lifting of content here, Bishop uses the terms ‘trinity’, ‘triunity’ and — amazingly — ‘A Trinity of Trinities’ in the exposition of his constructive theology. These terms are completely re-worked in _The URANTIA Book_.

**3. Breasted, James Henry, 1933, ‘The Dawn Of Conscience’ (Charles Scribner's Sons, New York).**

Paper 95, ‘The Melchizedek Teachings in the Levant’, Sections 2-5; Paper 111, ‘The Adjuster and the Soul’, preamble. Breasted's analysis and assessments of early Egyptian social idealism and religion — including the teachings of Amenemope and Ikhnaton, the ka and the ba, Egypt's influence on the hebrews, etc. are incorporated into _The URANTIA Book_'s corresponding discussions.

**4. Bundy, Walter E., 1928. ‘The Religion Of Jesus’ (The Bobs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis).**

Paper 196, ‘The Faith of Jesus’, preamble, Sections 1-2; etc. Portions from every chapter of this book, whose thesis is that the human Jesus founded the religion of personal experience and that we must recover the religion of Jesus from the religion about Jesus, are deftly concentrated in Paper 196, with the retention of many of Bundy's exact wordings.

**5. Bundy, Walter E., 1929, ‘Our Recovery Of Jesus’**

(The Bobs-Merrill Company, Indianapolis).Paper 196, ‘The Faith of Jesus’, preamble, sections 1 and 2. A companion volume to the preceding book, this one has material that parallels paragraphs in Paper 196 which were not paralleled by the preceding book. The two books together supply about 95% of the basis of the preamble and the first two sections. The last differs in tone and content and may be original with the midwayers.

**6. Burton, Ernest Dewitt And Matthews, Shailer, 1900, 1927, ‘The Life Of Christ’ (University of Chicago Press, Chicago).**

Part IV, Passim. The content of this book does not appear to be used but rather its chapter and section titles. Parallel titles include: ‘The Crisis at Capernaum’, ‘Discourse on Spiritual Freedom’, ‘The Widespread Fame of Jesus [Christ]’, ‘The Man with the Withered Hand’, ‘The Woman Taken from Adultery’ and ‘[More] Parables by the Sea’.

**7. Cowdry, E.V., Editor, 1930, ‘Human Biology \& Racial Welfare’ (Paul B. Hoeber, Inc., New York).**

Paper 51, ‘The Planetary Adams’, Section 4; Paper 65, ‘The Overcontrol of Evolution’, Section 2; Paper 82, ‘The Evolution of Marriage’, Section 6; etc. The revelators use essays by Hrdlicka, Conklin and Davenport in their discussions of race differences, the dangers and benefits of race mixing, and the feasibility of a modest eugenics program.

**8. Edwards, Tryon, Original Compiler, 1890-1934 and later ‘The New Dictionary of Thoughts’ (Classic Publishing Co., London \& New York).**

Paper 48, ‘The Morontia Life’, Section 7. The vast majority of the 28 ‘statements of human philosophy’ in the Morontia Mota section are taken directly and consecutively from the first 50 pages of this 750-page book, which is arranged alphabetically by subject. The subjects from which the revelators cull quotations include: Ability, Accident, Adversity, Affectation, Affliction, Anger, Anxiety, Art, Aspiration, etc. These quotes are usually not reproduced verbatim in the Papers, but are recast so as to have a more cosmic and spiritual tone.

**9. Fosdick, Harry Emerson, 1933, ‘The Hope of the World’ (Harper and Brothers, New York \& London).**

Paper 171, ‘On the Way to Jerusalem’, Section 7. “Goodness is effective only when it is attractive”, on page 1874, is the essence of Fosdick's sermon ‘The Fine Art of Making Goodness Attractive’.

**10. Frost Jr., S.E., Compiler and Editor, 1943, ‘The Sacred Writings of the World's Great Religions’ (The New Home Library, New York).**

Paper 131, ‘The World's Religions’. This book is a selection from previous (and unfortunately, uncited) translations of various holy books. _The URANTIA Book_ appears to use this book's Jain and Shinto translations and selections in its ‘abstract of Ganid's manuscript’ dealing with these religions.

**11. Hartshorne, Charles, 1941, ‘Men's Vision of God’ (Willett, Clark and Co., Chicago).**

‘Foreword’, Section 1. Hartshorne's list of seven conceivable types of perfection is reproduced almost verbatim on page 3 of _the URANTIA Book_. I suspect that Hartshorne published an earlier (pre-1935) presentation of this system in a journal, so it was probably already in print before the ‘Foreword’ was written.

**12. Hopkins, E. Washburn, 1923, ‘Origin and Evolution of Religion’ (Yale University Press, New Haven, Connecticut).**

The whole of Paper 85, ‘The Origins of Worship’, is taken directly and consecutively from the first eight chapters of this book, each section in the paper corresponding to a chapter in the book. Paper 92, ‘The Later Evolution of Religion’ incorporates some of Hopkin's comments as ido Paper 90 , and 95 ; and the preamble and Section 1 of Paper 104, ‘Growtn of the Trinity Concept’ are taken directly from Hopkins' chapters on ‘The Triad’, ‘The Hindu Trinity’, ‘The Buddhistic Trinity’, and ‘The Christian Trinity’.

**13. Jones, Rufus M., 1932, ‘A Preface to Christian Faith in a New Age’ (Macmillan Co., New York).**

Paper 195, ‘After Pentecost’, Sections 5-10. Every chapter of the book is used in the revelators' discussions of Christianity's struggle to awaken to its spiritual mission in the face of modern secularism and its own institutional shortcomings. Virtually every paragraph of section 10, ‘The Future’ is drawn consecutively from the last half of this book.

**14. Jones, Rufus M., 1916, ‘The Inner Life’ (McMillan Co., New York).**

Paper 102, ‘The Foundations of Religious Faith’ preamble. Jones quotes the same two extracts of Bertrand Russell's ‘A Free Man's Worship’ (1906?) which the Melchizedek paraphrases in the first two paragraphs of the paper. Both Jones and the Melchizedek use these passages to illustrate materialistic despair, which can only be remedied by faith in God and a spiritual interpretation of the Universe.

**15. Noble, Edmund, 1926, ‘Purposive Evolution: The Link between Science and Religion’ (Henry Bolt and Co., New York).**

Paper 42, ‘Energy — Mind and Matter’, Section 11; Paper 116, ‘The Almighty Supreme’, Section 7. Noble's theory of cosmic self- maintenance (the universe as purposive) is referred to in _The URANTIA Book_ on page 482; his chapter, ‘Is the Universe an Organism?’ (in which he gives a negative answer) seems to be responded to by the revelators on pages 1276-77, ‘The Living Organism of the Grand Universe’.

**16. Osborn, Henry Fairfield, 1928, ‘Man Rises to Parnassus: Critical Epochs in the Prehistory of Man’ (Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey).**

Paper 64, ‘The Evolutionary Races of Color’, Sections 2,4; Paper 80, ‘Andite Expansion in the Occident’, Sections 3,8,9; etc. This book seems to be the prime source for _The URANTIA Book_'s discussion of the successive human races in Europe from the Foxhall peoples to the Neanderthals, the Cro-magnons and the ancestors of the Nordics. _The URANTIA Book_ adheres to Osborn's geological, racial, and cultural chronologies and to his characterizations of the cultures of these various peoples. Osborn's discussion of the Bretons is paralleled exactly on page 899 of _The URANTIA Book_.

**17. Palmer, George Herbert, 1930, ‘The Autobiography of a Philosopher’ (Greenwood Press reprint, New York, 1968).**

Paper 181, ‘Final Admonitions and Warnings’, Section 1. Palmer's assertion of the superiority of the inner peace resulting from faith in the Father's loving care over the “two inferior forms of hardihood” (optimism and stoicism) is paralleled in _The URANTIA Book_'s discussion on pages 1954-55.

Sabatier's book was quite influential; both Rufus Jones and Walter Bundy, among others refer to the religions of authority and the religion of the spirit, attributing the origin of the latter to Jesus, as does Sabatier.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### Book Review Of ‘The Life And Teachings Of Jesus’

_by L. Preston Thomas, California_

This book is a restatement of Jesus' life and teachings created by putting together verses from the New Testament Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. These verses are arranged in chronological format inspired by Part IV of _The URANTIA Book_. The translations used for particular verses were chosen with an eye toward their harmony with the wording of the Urantia Papers. In general only those teachings that are verified by the new revelation are included, while erroneous passages are simply left out.

The effort is to provide a simple, comprehensive, and true statement of Jesus' life and teachings that will be readily accepted by most people, especially those with a Christian background.

Through a clearer and truer statement of Jesus' life and gospel, it is hoped that this work can contribute to the expansion of his kingdom — the rule of God in the hearts of his earth children.

Believers in the Urantia revelation may find that this book has other special uses:

First, it provides a much needed tool of ministry for followers of the new revelation. These gospel verses furnish us with all the true teachings of Jesus.

Second, this book harmonizes the teachings of the Bible with the teachings of the Urantia Papers. It is a demonstration of the deep harmony that exists between the teachings of the gospels and the new revelation.

Third, this collection of teachings provides a language of intercommunication — a language that is common to both sets of believers.

Fourth, this book provides the cream of the gospels relatively purified of the human errors that became a part of the early Christian teachings.

Finally, this book provides a means for believers in _The URANTIA Book_ to go forward now in the direction projected by the Urantia revelation, the return to Jesus and his true teachings.

The book is available at the price of \$US16 (including postage) from:

_Einstein School Publications_

_3720 El Rincon Way_
_Sacramento, CA 95864_

### Study Booklets From The Fellowship

As a service to our continued study of _The URANTIA Book_ and its teachings, The Fellowship has developed new booklets which are now available:

**Glossary And Pronunciation Reference**

This new 24-page reference work contains brief definitions, pronunciations, and primary page references for over 200 words selected from _The URANTIA Book_. This glossary has been limited primarily to words which are not included in other standard reference sources. Although a phonetic spelling approach to pronunciation has been used in this first English edition, it is the intention in future editions to utilize the alphabet of the International Phonetic Association (IPA) to facilitate international usage of this reference tool (cost $US2 plus $US1 overseas postage).

**A Summary Of Textual Changes Made In _The Urantia Book_:**

(Since the first printing in 1955 through and including the tenth printing in March, 1990). This Summary of Changes Reference was compiled from research conducted over many years by dedicated students of _The URANTIA Book_. Its purpose is to help answer questions often raised in study groups when reading aloud from different printings of _The URANTIA Book_ raises an inconsistency. These changes were made by the publisher of _The URANTIA Book_ (URANTIA Foundation Trustees) for reasons and by whose authority they have chosen not to reveal. Although most of the changes are minor (spelling and grammatical changes) they are compiled as a simple matter of record and made readily available to readers. (No charge. \$US1 for overseas postage.)

In addition, The Fellowship has recently published the 1992-93 International Study Group Directory. It lists 302 Study Groups worldwide and all Area Coordinators. it represents a most impressive readership family.

### The Purpose Of The Fifth Epochal Revelation?

**Adapted from a file (SOS1 OYR.NLA) in the Brotherhood of Man Library.**

What is the specific purpose of the Fifth Epochal Revelation on this planet? Perhaps the simplest answer is that it has been given to us in order that we should proclaim the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of All Men. But that message has been proclaimed before, so is there some other purpose for this revelation? Undoubtedly part of its purpose is to rectify errors that have partially negated the effectiveness of the Fourth Epochal Revelation. Another purpose would be to amplify upon the knowledge of our place in God's creation from a cosmic viewpoint. But why has this new revelation come to us at this time, and not 1000 years hence or whence?

To try to answer this question, let us take a look at [Paper 99, ‘The Social Problems of Religion’](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99), addressing specific problems confronting our planet in this century. We are told that, in the past, religion did not have to adjust its attitude to extensive changes in economic and political systems; then it goes on to comment on the current rapidity of changes in living conditions, which require that institutional modifications must be greatly accelerated, and that religion must accordingly quicken its adaptation to an ever-changing social order. We are told that this period of gross instability will not settle down for a millennium, that is 1000 years! Hence, “_the human race must become reconciled to a procession of changes, adjustments, and readjustments. Mankind is on the march toward a new and unrevealed destiny_”.

In considering the purpose of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, surely we must take these prophetic statements into account. Many of us may feel an urgency about getting on with changing and saving the world right now. But this prophecy is telling us that as fast as we adjust to world problems, new changes will be occurring that will require more adjustments and this situation will be with us for at least 1000 years. So we need to keep in mind the time span that will elapse before any semblance to stability on Urantia can be expected.

Having adjusted our thinking to dynamic, long-term change on the material level, what should be the role of religion? The Paper states: “_Religion must become a forceful influence for moral stability and spiritual progression_”, and “_The paramount mission of religion as a social influence is to stabilize the ideals of mankind during these dangerous times of transition from one phase of civilization to another, from one level of culture to another_”.

From these statements, several inferences may be drawn. We have no specific exhortation to prepare for any holocaust-like situation, so perhaps our attitude should be to take no anxious thought but to get on with living today, leaving tomorrow 'to take care of itself. As instructed, we should be concerned with stabilizing the morals and ideals of mankind. The Paper tells us that there are no new religious duties to perform, the role of religion being as a wise guide and experienced counsellor. But the leaders of our best religious institutions know all that, and there is certainly plenty of wisdom and experience to draw upon in the churches, seminaries, theological colleges, university departments of religion, and so on. So why was the Fifth Epochal Revelation necessary?

Perhaps [Section 2 of this Paper](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p2) supplies an answer to this question. We are told that institutional religion is unable to provide the necessary leadership and inspiration because it is in a ‘Catch 22’ situation. It cannot reconstruct society without first reconstructing itself and it cannot reconstruct itself until society has been radically reconstructed. Anyone who has had anything to do with changing some part of church liturgy or custom will know how true is that statement. Section 2 then goes on to tell us that religionists must function in society, industry, and politics as individuals, not as groups or institutions. The proper role of the institutionalized church in the changes already upon us is stated to be the teaching of nonviolence, the doctrine of peaceful evolution in the place of violent revolution, and peace on earth and goodwill among all men. Moving forward to Section 4 we read:

> “_No matter what upheavals may attend the social and economic growth of civilization, religion is genuine and worth while if it fosters in the individual an experience in which the sovereignty of truth, beauty, and goodness prevails, for such is the true spiritual concept of supreme reality. And through love and worship this becomes meaningful as fellowship with man and sonship with God_”. [UB 99:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p4_4)

From these statements we may deduce that, for a long time to come, the main role of religion in the advancement of our civilization rests not so much with institutions but with the behaviour of the individual. This view is confirmed in Section 3:

> “_the attainment of a high cultural civilization demands, first, the ideal type of citizen and, then, ideal and adequate social mechanisms wherewith such a citizenry may control the economic and social institutions of an advanced human society_”. [UB 99:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_4)

But what is all this telling us about the reasons why we have this Fifth Epochal Revelation right now? It appears that we are being told that we have a 1000 -year job in front of us which, at least at first, should be confined almost entirely to the production of ideal citizens who will, as individuals, serve to stabilize the moral and spiritual progression of society during rapid periods of change. But the message of _The URANTIA Book_ relevant to the production of an ideal citizenry is discernible from the teachings of Jesus and particularly his parables as they are recorded in the four Gospels of the New Testament, and have been known to millions upon millions of Christians for nigh on 2000 years! So where is Christianity deficient, and how is _The URANTIA Book_ telling us to compensate for that deficiency?

The answer to that question may well be that the vast majority of Christians know, but do not live the message of Jesus. And a possible reason for that is that for almost 2000 years, the message has been taught that Christ died for our sins — which to many, appears to let us off the hook.

Undoubtedly a very large proportion of practicing Christians are genuine and sincere disciples of Jesus. But, according to _The URANTIA Book_, there is a considerable difference between the requirements for discipleship and those for apostleship. Perhaps then, the demand being placed upon us by the Fifth Epochal Revelation is that we must follow the original twelve apostles into apostleship?

The qualifications for apostleship are set out in Paper 140 of _The URANTIA Book_. It is quite possible to read this Paper and to conclude that it was meant only for the original twelve. But this is not so. In Section 1, paragraph 4 , apostleship is offered to all who would take the path of the twelve. That offer is reiterated in Section 3, paragraph 20 where Jesus says:

> “_But everyone who hears this charge and sincerely executes his commission to represent me before men even as I have represented my Father to you, shall find abundant entrance into my service and into the kingdom of the heavenly Father_”. [UB 140:3.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_20)

We need to consider whether the real demands of the Fifth Epochal Revelation may be for firstly hundreds, then thousands, followed by millions upon millions of URANTIA Book students, all willing to undertake the more difficult pathway of apostleship. Perhaps it is the role of these modern apostles to exemplify in their lives the meaning of the ‘ideal type of citizen’ referred to in Paper 99 who will catalyze the eventual attainment of the high cultural civilization that is prophesied to eventuate approximately 1000 years from now.

One difference between discipleship and apostleship as announced by Jesus is that, in undertaking apostleship, we elect to represent him in the world in the same way that, in his human life on Urantia, he represented the Father. That is certainly a rigorous undertaking, not to be entered into lightly. Among much else, it requires us to comprehend that the kingdom of God is within us, that we are no longer servants but sons of the living God, and that it is not by the words we speak but by the lives we live that we will represent Jesus to the world.

In the past many Christians have entered fully into apostleship, but Christianity has failed to lead the world along the required pathway simply because the majority of Christians elect, at best, for discipleship. Maybe then, the major purpose of the Fifth Epochal Revelation is the progressive recruitment of vast multitudes of genuine, totally committed apostles. It is surely worth a thought.

## On Reflection

### Why Do We Need Leaders?

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Queensland_

I see so many of my beloved brothers and sisters running around trying to find someone to lead them, someone to follow.

Why do any of us need a lesser person than Jesus to follow? Perhaps it is because Jesus refuses, in love, to do as we ask — to tell us exactly what we should be doing. Are we not supposed to be doing the will of God? So why can't we get our orders directly? Is it that a false idea has infiltrated into our minds on what the will of God really means? In answer to a question Jesus said:

> “_The will of God is the way of God, partnership with the choice of God in the face of any potential alternative. To do the will of God, therefore, is the progressive experience of becoming more and more like God, and God is the source and destiny of all that is good and beautiful and true._” ([UB 130:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p2_7))

In seeking to know and to do the will of God, it is not so much what we do but how we do it that is important. God is not going to make our decisions for us. We make spiritual progress only through making our own decisions. Making them in accordance with the will of God simply means making God-like decisions, then carrying them out in a God-like manner. Our role model to do this is to be discovered in the life and teachings of Jesus. _The URANTIA Book_ tells us:

> “_Material evolution has provided you a life machine, your body; the Father himself has endowed you with the purest spirit reality known in the universe, your Thought Adjuster. But into your hands, subject to your own decisions, has been given mind, and it is by mind that you live or die. It is within this mind and with this mind that you make those moral decisions which enable you to achieve Adjuster likeness, and that is Godlikeness._” ([UB 111:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_4))

But we persist in wanting direct orders — to be told what to do. How can Jesus tell us the future! He knows full well that the future is God's. He knows full well that God will arm us, with all that is required to cope with and overcome any adversity which might come our way.

Why should we be so distrustful? We don't mean to be but we are, and, in our anxiety we run to a loving brother or sister until we find one who is so eager for our love and approval that they disturb their own minds in order to fill our need. Then we sit at the feet of our gurus and delude ourselves. We ask them to make our decisions, to tell us our future and they oblige. The book tells us that Jesus sat at no man's feet (1388:3).

In following our new found leader, we write our own future in the process, forcing our patient Thought Adjuster to throw away the preferred plan, in deference to our will. What do we think our Thought Adjuster is doing all day but trying to spiritualize us!

What a blessing to have _The URANTIA Book_. I had looked for a model in life. Someone to emulate. Someone to look up to. Someone whom I could copy, knowing that his/her way of thinking, feeling, and doing things, were the ways, thoughts and feelings which I could strive to adopt, as the best way of living for me.

Because I lost Jesus in the Bible, I needed _the URANTIA Book_, and then my hero, my leader, my model blossomed into reality as an achievable ideal. Here was my perfect model for ‘God-likeness’. But as I looked at his life, the description of the growth of his moral, emotional and mental maturity, I realized that it takes lots of work. Jesus had culminated his growth in perfection at a chronological age, a few years before I had even started mine. So I recognized that there was a long haul ahead of me to reach the level of maturity that he attained on Urantia. Perhaps I will look like my model did in his mid-thirties by the time I wave goodbye to him as I leave for Edentia. But he will still be my model in those longahead days, for he will have shown me a Jesus-Michael model to follow on my pathway to Paradise.

As a human, it is sad that we find models to copy in life, such as our parents in early life, only to have our dreams shattered with the reality that our human models are just normal imperfect humans. What a blessing to discover a model in the human Jesus, who one day will be able to reveal himself to me as a semi-spiritual model, followed by a spiritual model and so on, dependent upon my ability to see and appreciate. I need no other model. Why settle for second best?

The future is God's. He has the idea for the story of my life. I wish God's will to be my will and I know that the will of God is the way of God, a process of being, not doing. I want my will and my mind to be so attuned to my Thought Adjuster's that the two are indistinguishable and so, with copious support, and assistance from my beloved Adjuster, I try to make my decisions as I believe Jesus would have made them, knowing that, in doing so, they are most likely to be in harmony with God's desires for me.

### When all is said and done...

> “_...there is a way, there always has been, and I have come to make that way new and living._” ([UB 146:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p3_7))
