## Editor's Notebook

Gallup research (1985,1987,1989) in the US demonstrates patterns in public opinion about religion.

- increasing interest despite a growth in ‘unchurched’ Americans
- a greater religious pluralism
- movement toward more conservative, fundamentalist churches
- a move out of organized religions

These opinions then penetrate attitudes on moral authority, the separation of church and state, and media reporting of religious issues. Can a new ‘conscience’ of independent thinking be identified? Signs of unpatriotic individualism? People are proactively taking charge of religious proclivities in their lives.

Professional advocates to government and public affairs are having difficulty in selling news of their religious organizations. Instead, demand is for news on moralizing rhetoric, policy position, and political influence.

In such a climate, proactive strategy building by religious groups becomes hazardous. In the 102nd Congress, for example, religious freedom was a key issue, and often caused coalitions to be formed or broken.

Nonetheless, there is the need for UB officials to move to a proactive posture.

Yet any number of determinants seem likely to preclude any such eventuality. Poor reader opinion climate, no Foundation research on readership, its media bias, lack of strategic alliances, and poor communication, are likely to ensure it. A proactive approach could include considerations such as:

- a publicised multiple-issue agenda, one to stir up enthusiasm and interest. A vision for the 90's.
- avoid reacting from a secular role, and get ahead of the existing trend curve, through a strategic analysis which will include issues management over the next 5 to 10 years.
- encouragement of field workers. They organize, they publish, they research, they spend, indifferent to the non-existence of official support. They direct resources to worthwhile projects, organizations, and even individuals.
- tap into the infrastructure of existing church organizations. It is cost effective, highly persuasive, and the laity have already done the groundwork.
- left largely to circumstance, a long-term media strategy is doomed. A free-for-all of comments, devoured by sensationalist media, will outweigh an uncoordinated official line of planetary revelation. I fear the embarrassed explanation after the fact, and an irretrievable public perception.

It is worth noting that the Catholic Church, governed traditionally by its hierarchy with its ‘top-down’ information flow has no organizational mechanism built in for receiving information from its own constituents.

The Church has been advised to explain to its own membership, its stakeholders, why it takes the stands it does. This paradigm is a grass roots lobbying technique.

Such public persuasion is essential as the media alone, through opinion and events reporting, is not sufficient to generate religious commitment. People change their religious opinions (Gallup again) over the course of a lifetime according to their life stages and in response to personal circumstance. Again there is little patriotism.

And patriotism, especially religious patriotism, will be the last refuge of a static organization, one of which is out of adaptive creativity, out of energy, and out of touch.

Many religious movements, it would seem, on the path to patriotism, are in the stage of presumed loyalty.

## So They Say

**Terry Lane (broadcaster and writer)**

If I ran all of my correspondence together I could prove to anyone's satisfaction that I am a MarxistLeninist Friedmanite sexist racist pacifist war-mongering Bible-believing atheistic anarchist fascist consumerist Luddite. Is this being all things to all men?

**Thoreau — ‘On Civil Disobodience’**

There will never be a really free and enlightened State, until the State comes to recognize the individual as a higher and independent power, from which all its own power and authority are derived, and treats him accordingly.

**R. Brasch — ‘Strange Customs’**

The circle's very shape increased its antidemonic potency. Having neither beginning nor ending, it stood for eternity — infinity. It symbolized perfection and constant renewal.It meant ultimate oneness in which there was no room for another power. No wonder earlier cultures...used it as a magic shield against all hostile and dangerous agencies.

**Ola Raknes — ‘Life And Religion’**

In all cultures and in all religions the characteristics of sacredness have been laid down with the same certainty as erroneous theories. The certainty is just as strong in the case of theories which are later shown to be false, as it is for those which may be confirmed by research. To ask if a religion such as Christianity is true, is only meaningless, and gives evidence simply of unclear thought processes.

**M.R. Sharaf, Ph.D., Boston, 1970**

Wilhelm Reich's own answer to changing individual structures was an increasing awareness on organic, slow, individual and social development. People who knew what they were doing should quietly work and set an example so that life positive concepts and techniques would influence others. Let work itself and the interconnections between workers dictate development. Eliminate the agitations in political ideological forms.

## Letters To The Editor

### Conference Photos

_by Terry Hovaghimian, Sydney_

I'm sending you some photos from the 1992 URANTIA Book Conference. I will endeavour to compile the whole collection of photos of all conferences I have attended, so they can be seen by all at the next conference.

The photos are great, and represent treasured memories of great friendships. Details of the 1993 Conference to be announced in the next issue of Six-O-Six. Ed.

### The Media And The ‘Good News’

_by David Cook, Jan Juc, Victoria_

In olden days news was delivered by a town crier and by word of mouth. A street speaker was listened to as a matter of course. So was it that the immediate evangelists and apostles of Jesus proclaimed the glad tidings God had given them. These days, people are eager to turn the telly on at $6: 30 pm$ and to read the daily newspaper.

### Help Required!

_Urantla Book Reader, Pacific Region_

The book is kind of hard to read if you have nobody to help you in the beginning and I don't like my friends to be discouraged as soon as they start reading.

Also if I can introduce them to some other readers too, that is nice.

### Involvement Required!

_T. Mulhall, Melboume_

I would like to see more well-researched, comprehensive and involved articles. I feel the book deserves our serious attention. More on-going feedback from readers and writers would also be stimulating.

## News Around The World

### Archaeological Find

A magnificent palace built by Herod the Great, infamous for killing the children of Bethlehem, has been found on the coast of Israel.

It has been discovered at Caesarea, the ancient capital of the Roman province of Judaea, now an Israeli national park.

Archaeologists from the US and Israel uncovered a luxurious mosaic-covered dining room, and the remains of a swimming pool.

While Herod's great naval port of Caesarea has been long known, no one until now knew he had built a palace there.

### FEF International Fellowship Committee, Moscow Visit

John Lange, Chairman of the International Fellowship Committee, and Lila Dogim presented _The URANTIA Book_ to a spiritual congress in Moscow in October of last year.'The presentation was well received.

John also reported that they held a small study group and returned home with requests for 25 books. “We feel encouraged about the potential impact these contacts will have.”

### Dinosaur Missing Link

Palaeontologists announced the discovery of the most primitive dinosaur fossil yet, thought to be the ‘common ancestor’ of all dinosaurs. Dubbed ‘eoraptor’, the dogsized dinosaur walked on two legs, had curved teeth and roamed the earth about 225 million years ago. Its skeleton was found in the fossil-rich Ischigualasto Valley of Argentina by American and Argentinean scientists.

### Spiritual Psychology

_Dr. Meredith J. Sprunger, Fort Wayne, Indiana, USA_

Psychology originated in the study of the more troubled aspects of the human mind. Humanistic psychology made a significant leap forward in attempting to study healthy minds and what makes them healthy. Dr. Sprunger has taken the third major step, bringing the study of the human mind fully within the realm of spiritual reality.

Dr. Sprunger's new book, ‘Spiritual Psychology’ attempts to unify two great fields of human thought and experience — psychology and religion. It sets forth a series of basic principles for the study of the mind within the great, dynamic spiritual setting in which it functions.

The book may be ordered from:

_Jemenon Inc._
_PO Box 725 Wilmette, Il 60091, USA_
_Cost is $US16 plus $3 postage and handling._

### Anzura Bulletin Reports

**South Pacific Conference II**

The seeds have been planted for the idea of a second South Pacific conference to be held in New Zealand and hosted by New Zealand Anzura members. It is likely this will occur in 1995 or 1996 so start thinking about making plans for holidays etc. We hope to be able to announce more specifics in 1993.

**New Zealand Library Placement Scheme**

Marion Steward has prepared a list of libraries in New Zealand to be targeted for library donations of _The URANTIA Book_. There are over 100 libraries to be approached. A proposal will be sent to URANTIA Foundation before the end of the year asking for this number of books to be sent to Marion. Providing this request is granted, Marion will then coordinate the donation of these books to libraries.

## Articles

### More on Channelling

_William Wentworth, Towamba, NSW_

In writing to support the editor's comments in the July/August edition, I wish to make a couple of points which I don't think have been adequately covered so far.

In the first place, most of us accept the notion that truth can be assessed only by its content. Lacking, as we do, any known authority to discriminate between truth and falsehood for us, we can only determine the matter by our own lights, according to what makes sense to us, by what appeals to our highest ideals and activates our purest motives. Those of us who believe _The URANTIA Book_ to be in fact the revelation it claims to be, and not some clever fraud, have adopted this attitude because the contents of the book have convinced us that it is what it says it is. As far as I know, this is the only way we can validate any revelation, by the inner conviction that what is revealed is truth, and not falsehood. For those of us to whom it makes sense, _The URANTIA Book_ is its own validation. No outside authority exists to validate it for us.

In the same way, truth, from whatever source, can be assessed and validated only by whether or not it appeals to our highest lights. If it does so appeal then we can accept it; if it does not, we reject it. The whole question of where it comes from is of no consequence, just as it is of no consequence in our acceptance of the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_.

If ‘channellers’, or others involved in abnormal methods of communication have some truth to impart, let them impart it. We'll make up our minds about its validity in the usual way, without reference to the mode of its origin. Whether information is ‘channelled’ or discovered in some other way makes absolutely no difference as to whether we accept it or not, for that decision is made, not by any consideration of the manner of its reception, but by the conviction content of the information itself. If what these ‘channelers’ are doing is trying to establish superhuman authority for points of view which are really just embellishments of their own ideas, then we'll quickly perceive this because the quality of the information will not be commensurate with the authority claimed for it. Unfortunately the world has its share of either outright frauds or else the sincerely self-deceived. We do, after all, want to avoid their traps.

The second point I wish to make is that, considered in its entirety, _The URANTIA Book_ really constitutes a warning against indulgence in the paranormal, the strange or the unusual. The thrust of the book is a complete de-emphasis of the strange and unusual, and an affirmation that most of the truth in us, and of us, is derived from ordinary humdrum existence. The book makes the point in dozens of different ways, that God's will is done primarily in everyday life, in a universe of rational order, largely devoid of peculiar psychic manifestations. Both the growth of the Supreme and the growth of the individual ascender depend on commonplace daily life, glorified by the way in which that daily life is lived. The knowledge of God and the desire to do his will inspires the individual to live the ordinary in such a way as to make it extraordinary. The humdrum is thus elevated to the sublime, and this is what is so astonishing and exhilarating about life.

Preoccupation with the dramatic aspects of the unusual and exceptional can be stimulating and exciting, but it is not the message of _The URANTIA Book_. I support the editor of Six-O-Six in his comments, and urge students of _The URANTIA Book_ to ignore those glamorous distractions which only serve to undermine its fundamental message to humanity.

### Variety — The Dice Of Life

_Allan Lane, Perth_

While reading a series of articles recently by Dr. Rupert Sheldrake, a brilliant researcher, whose work in the field of biology and in particular evolution, displays an exhilarating open-mindedness, and one by Colin Wilson in the same book, I began to contemplate the challenging ideas presented regarding the existence of such an astounding diversity of life forms on earth: it is estimated that there are currently millions of different species sharing the planet with us, and that there have been hundreds of millions of different species since life appeared here.

Why, I found myself asking more than ever before, such breathtaking variety? Our planet is home to at least 300,000 species of beetles, at least 20,000 species of wild orchids, about 200,000 different kinds of moths and butterflies, hundreds and hundreds each of wattles and eucalypts, and who knows how many spiders!

I will try in this article to stick mainly to this issue of diversity while examining the theories for its explanation as presented by established science and _The URANTIA Book_. In later articles I would like to investigate the thorny topic of the inheritance of instinct and form.

Molecular biologists and theoretical physicists are the high priests of today's scientific establishment, and their discoveries and theories have emboldened many of them to decree that life is nothing more than a complex interaction between matter and energy that one day will be routinely created in the laboratory. Many who have dared to suggest otherwise have been vehemently attacked and ridiculed, as sadly evidenced in the editorial article of the 24th September 1981 issue of ‘Nature’ entitled ‘A Book for Burning?’, wherein Sheldrake's suggestion that as yet unidentified nonmaterial agencies may work with and through an organism's genetic coding in the DNA of its cells, to help produce the life phenomena of our world, is given the third degree. This hair-trigger reaction to ideas that challenge the mechanistic world view is a symptom of a religiously fanatical faith in the correctness of this belief, and ironically, such behaviour is most unscientific.

#### Neo-Darwinism's Explanation

Neo-Darwinism is the doctrine used by a majority of the scientific establishment to account for the diversity of living things. It claims that the entire blueprint for an organism, determining form, function, and behaviour, is present in the DNA molecules within its first embryonic cell formed from the union of its two parents' sex cells. For offspring to differ markedly from their parents and so be a new species immediately [punctuationalism], or, as preferred by the neo-Darwinists, to differ slightly in the direction of a new species [gradualism], rearrangements of the position and hence order of certain submolecules must occur along the DNA supermolecule, thereby altering the code ensconced along its length. This altered code produces the altered organism, differing in form or function or behaviour, or as is often the case, all three.

These molecular rearrangements which alone produce the hereditary variations are caused, they tell us, only by accidental and purposeless random mutations, triggered by such things as chemical reactions and bombardment by radiation, or by the random shuffling of genes as in the process of meiosis — the production of sex cells by the parent organism in which the likelihood that any two cells will carry identical information is minimized.

Once such a new organism has appeared it is subjected to the ruthless pressures of natural selection, so that if it possesses attributes favorable to survival and it reaches sexual maturity, it is likely to cement its altered DNA coding by successfully reproducing, asexually or sexually, depending on the type of organism. It may even compete for similar life needs better than its parent species and contribute to its extinction. Its numbers may increase sufficiently to include it as another successful species in the atlas of living things.

Multiplying the above described process by many millions over millions of years results in the abundant diversity of life on earth today. As there is no higher purpose guiding the evolution of life forms — it being completely accidental — it is ultimately a meaningless phenomenon.

#### _The Urantia Book_'s Explanation

_The URANTIA Book_ puts forward an explanation for the great diversity of life, both in the present and as preserved in the fossil record, which is markedly different in certain key respects and very similar in others to that of the neo-Darwinists. The major difference is that there is nothing accidental and purposeless about the course of the evolution of life: indeed highly intelligent beings were involved in the creation of its initial physical vehicles; the research for the genetic coding it required for its evolutionary adventure; the impartation of the divine life spark to animate it; the implantation of the ‘in vitro’ — so to speak — single celled organisms into the future biosphere; and the subsequent monitoring of progress, with alterations of environmental conditions where deemed necessary, to help the forward march of the advancing life forms — the antithesis of the neo-Darwinists' mindless, pointless, purposeless, expanding soup of matter and energy containing some curious, but unimportant, matter and energy interactions named ‘life’ by some form of that ‘life’.

Important roles are ascribed to both the apparently [I will have more to say on this later] random mutations of the genetic material — DNA is not mentioned by name: prior to the 1950's geneticists thought that proteins were the carriers of the cell's genetic codes, and I assume that the claimed revelators did not want to pre-empt our discovery as is their brief in these scientific matters — and to natural selection.

At first glance the neo-Darwinists' explanation is tempting to subscribe to, but upon deeper reflection gaping holes start to appear. One of the main difficulties for me are the unbelievably low probabilities I am called upon to virtually ignore for the random events to occur that are so crucial to their whole argument.

#### Unravelling DNA's Genetic Gode

Leaving aside the question of the origin of life, with the random and accidental events so beloved of the mechanists used to account for it, let us take a closer look at ‘living’ DNA and the mutation process, with a view to account for the enormous diversity of life saturating the biosphere.

The DNA molecule is composed of millions of atoms which are arranged in a long twisting shape, like a very long spiral staircase, whose steps are made from 2 each of only 4 kinds of smaller molecules, called bases, symbolized by the letters A, C, G, T, with the further limitation that only A and T can join with each other while C and G can also only join together; these ‘base pairs’ are the steps in the analogy. Starting from one end of the ‘stairs’ different ‘words’ can be spelt out in a coded language as illustrated in the diagram below, which shows the spiral staircase untwisted and laid flat.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia" alt="DNA">
<img src="/image/article/606/dna.jpg">
</figure>

Take, for example, the top row of letters and note that the 4 different bases are arranged in a differing order along this stretch of DNA, but with patterns evident [the astute reader will deduce that this DNA is from the feline family of mammals — “Is he serious?” I hear you asking!]. Joking aside, a major achievement of genetic researchers has been to discover that particular segments — called genes — of the DNA string, containing from hundreds to thousands and thousands of these chemical ‘letters’, form precise codes which help determine outcomes such as hair colour, brain cells, and heart muscle, and, when added to the codes in the DNA of all of an organism's chromosomes, represent the blueprint for that organism.

#### Big Numbers, Big Options

Highlighting the probabilities involved for positive changes in an organism will require a closer look at the coding method used on the DNA molecule. The smallest usable pieces of information are held by the base pairs in units of 3 side by side, called triplets, as illustrated below. Each position can be filled with 4 different letters, making a total of 64 different triplets possible in a tiny portion of DNA.

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia" alt="DNA">
<img src="/image/article/606/dna2.jpg">
</figure>

These triplets are responsible, through a multistepped process, for the selection, and joining together in chains, of amino acids in precise orders to make the all important proteins, of which there are thousands of different kinds, which indispensably govern the design and running of the huge variety of living cells. This crucial protein manufacturing process, in which the amino acid sequence represented by the order of the triplets is faithfully preserved throughout, is illustrated schematically below.

#### From Dna Goding To Protein Molecule

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia" alt="DNA">
<img src="/image/article/606/dna3.jpg">
</figure>

Looking now at a slightly longer stretch of DNA containing 5 tripiets, the number of possible different sequences can be calculated for that segment. Despite there being 64 different triplets that can occupy each of those 5 consecutive spaces, they can only cause selection, through the involved process illustrated above, of one amino acid per triplet from a pool of only 20 amino acids essential to life on earth. All of these amino acids are able to be selected by more than one triplet, except for methionine and tryptophan, with 3 of them having 6 triplets which can choose them, thus using the surplus triplets to their advantage. So each of the 5 triplet spaces illustrated below has 20 different amino acids that can be chosen, making the surprising total of 3,200,000 different amino acids sequences possible from such a tiny section of DNA!

<figure id="Figure_6" class="image urantiapedia" alt="DNA">
<img src="/image/article/606/dna4.jpg">
<figcaption>3,2000,000 DIFFERENT KINDS OF AMINO ACID SEQUENCES</figcaption>
</figure>

DNA can be regarded as the pages of an instruction book on which are printed the details for the construction of proteins, the genes being the chapters. Some chapters are very long, spelling out the manufacture of proteins containing thousands of amino acids in precisely ordered strings [via thousands of precisely ordered triplets]. The number of potential different proteins is enormous.

#### The Low Odds For Accidental Improvement

The proteins studied by our scientists so far range in amino acid numbers from about 50 to several thousand. Consider an imaginary protein with 300 amino acid building blocks, manufactured from the DNA instructions by the transcription-translation process outlined above. It will be only one of 20 to the power of 300 possible protein chains that the 300 triplet long stretch could be encoded to make [that's a number over 300 digits long]. What do numbers like this mean? By comparison, it is estimated that there are only 1076 protons and neutrons in the known universe. Mathematical calculation estimates the odds in favour of all of the known proteins used by cells arising by chance to be one in 10^40,000^ — that's a 1 followed by 40,000 zeros.

I am in awe of the ingenuity of this molecular coding system, which can punish severely or reward greatly for relatively small changes in the code, as, in the first case, in a disease like haemophilia, or, in the second, in changes to skin colour to enhance an animal's camouflage.

That accidental mutations could produce enough of the right instructions to counteract the virtually inestimable wrong instructions possible, in the right DNA positions at the right times, efficiently building upon previous advantageous accidental mutations, to produce the wonderful diversity of living things around us today, is beyond my capacity to seriously entertain. To my admittedly limited understanding the probability of such a long series of propitious events is surely so close to zero, as to be practically impossible.

Let us assume that placental mammals sprang suddenly from reptile parents as described in _The URANTIA Book_ ([UB 61:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p0_1)). In order to produce a new and unique organism obviously new and unique cells have to be made. Simplistically, to make a new cell requires at least one new protein, and to make a new protein requires a new effective DNA code [not all changes in the code cause changes in the proteins produced], and a new DNA code requires at least one rearrangement of a base molecule on the DNA string [a mutation]. How likely is an accidental random to produce the exact code(s) needed for this enormous leap? Or, assuming the giraffe's neck lengthened in steps over a long period of time — refer to the neo-Darwinists — how likely is it that the necessary neck length altering mutations would have randomly kept occurring, in the chronologically correct order, in the right parts of the appropriate ‘neck stretching’ genes? [For _the URANTIA Book_'s version of the giraffe's neck episode, see ([UB 61:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p4_4)).]

#### Higher Purpose?

Starting with the first human ancestor living cell to appear on earth, and leaving alone the issue of the mindboggling low odds in favor of its accidental birth for a future discussion, was the long chain of events and recoding activity within the cells' DNA, leading to the appearance of humans and hundreds of millions of different life forms along the way, a series of accidents, or was higher purpose involved? I place my bet on the latter, if even only because of the probabilities concerned in the issue. Geneticists tell us that more mutations are harmful than helpful. I think also that the more complex an organism becomes, the likelihood of harm from accidental unguided mutations would have to grow. If an abacus is dropped into a pool of water it can still perform its counting function, yet a speck of dust in the right place will render a computer useless.

If the myriad of living things on earth are the result of the work and planning of higher intelligences, how do we account for the role played by random mutations?

Imagine that I have built a roof, and I decide that I want to fill a rainwater tank for my drinking water needs. The falling of raindrops is a very random process in terms of what spots they will land on, and when the showers will come, and so on. It would be accidental if one tile received 2 extra drops during a shower than its neighbour. Yet if I place a gutter around the roof and lead a downpipe from it to the tank below, I achieve my objective. If I want to be ensured of the best results I will dutifully keep the gutter clear of leaves.

Just such a purposeful procedure is described in _The URANTIA Book_. The Life Carriers laboured long in their laboratories to produce the necessary formulas to enable life on earth to be successful ([UB 65:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_4)), and to have the important and essential capacity for great diversification ([UB 65:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p4_10)).

> “_The manifold by-products of biologic evolution are all essential to the final and full function of the higher intelligent forms of life..._” ([UB 36:2.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p2_17)).

The Divine Minister involves herself with the course of evolution through the agency of the adjutant mindspirits ([UB 36:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_1)). The original physical formulations of the Life Carriers can be likened to the roof, gutters, downpipe, and tank system described above, while the activities of the adjutant mind-spirits can be considered to be helping to keep the gutters clean.

If a being, who was ignorant of the meaning of the roof and tank system and the existence of me the designer and gutter cleaner, should come across it and start to study it through the seasons, that being may conclude that the wonderful periodic replenishment of the tank was an accidental eventuality of random events, and miss the careful planning that went into it. I could only marvel at the being's ingenuity in attempting to explain me away.

In my opinion, the general principle of intelligently created and guided life, implanted on planets to evolve into a multiplicity of higher forms, by beings of greater ability than us is far, far, and away better supported by the mathematics involved than the general principle of a totally accidental series of life evolving events.

As for the precise details of the more probable of the two competing theories, as described at great length in _The URANTIA Book_, only the passage of time allowing for a great deal more research, deep thinking, and perhaps, further revelation, will help establish their degrees of accuracy.

My definition of true science is: the honest attempt to understand objective reality. My earnest hope is that large numbers of true scientists — including you and me and regardless of our formal education — will work on the puzzle, fearlessly looking at the data no matter what the consequences for cherished theories, for articles of faith, and refuse to invent the universe but rather describe it.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### The Women's Corps

_Pam and David Bradford, Eden, NSW_

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us ([UB 84:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p5_9)) that in an enlightened developing society women are equal to men and are afforded equal rights and hold positions in society hand in hand with men. We are also told that although equality is important, it must not be mistaken for meaning that men and women think the same or are capable of exactly the same feats of achievement. Women have intuition, men have logic. Thus we are told (and the reader should be aware) that men and women enhance one another's existence through mortal and spiritual existence.

At the time of Jesus' mortal presence on Urantia, women held a lower place in society, not being considered worthy of holding positions of civic, political, or religious power. Therefore when Jesus appointed ten women as the original Women's Corps many eyebrows were raised by his male disciples, and no doubt there were some malevolent feelings from church and political leaders of the time.

These ten women appointed to the Corps must have been also selected for their varied backgrounds, as well as their strong faith.

The ten had served in the former encampment and infirmary. During this time they had listened to Jesus' instruction to young evangelists. It did not occur to the ten that they would be given responsibilities by Jesus to impart the word of the Master ([UB 150:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p1_1)).

The names and backgrounds of the ten women were:

- **Susanna** — Daughter of the former chazan of the Nazareth synagogue.
- **Joanna** — Wife of Chuza, the steward of Herod Antipas.
- **Elizabeth** — The daughter of a wealthy Jew of Tiberias and Sepphoris.

From the advent of the Women's Corps, it can be seen that Jesus was in effect laying the groundwork for full emancipation of women as both physical and spiritual equals. A significant thing worth noting is, at that time, the power of government and religion was a male domain. Jesus said:

> “_In the kingdom of Heaven there is neither rich nor poor, free nor bond, male nor female, all are equal sons and daughters of God._” ([UB 150:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p1_3))

Even though the disciples had heard Jesus say this often they were still of a conservative nature and were shocked at the astounding event.

And we read on [UB 84:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p6_4) that, “_The hand that rocks the cradle still fraternizes with destiny_”.

They were given funds to start with but afterwards managed their own affairs and drew upon their own resources to fund the Corps.

The success of the Women's Corps can be judged by the fact that without fear of favour, they preached the gospel to their sisters, no matter what their background. This is an interesting fact as it may be noted that at times the male disciples had a tendency to be selective and judgmental.

The appointment of women to positions of spreading the word was to be carried on after the cessation of Jesus' mortal life by the disciples, but gradually reversions took place and today we still see examples of opposition to women's roles as equals to males in leadership.

The members of the Women's Corps proved to be faithful to Jesus to the end.

### Can Caligastia Really Get At Our Minds?

_Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

Firstly, let me state unequivocally that I don't know. Until recently my reaction to this question has been, “No, not likely”. After all, _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that since the cross of Christ, Caligastia has been comparatively impotent ([UB 53:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p8_9)). Besides that we are assured of survival providing we do not deliberately and knowingly reject it, and even then we have to agree to our own annihilation. Then we have another statement that says:

> “_The only means of communion with the spiritual world is embraced in the spirit endowment of mankind, the indwelling Spirit of the Father, together with the outpoured spirit of the Son and the omnipresent influence of the Infinite Spirit._” ([UB 150:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p3_7))

That word ‘only’ is tremendously important. It implies that if Caligastia, who presumably is a spirit, wants to get at us, it must be indirectly through our indwelling Spirit endowment — in reality, our first line of defence against him.

Those are comforting thoughts, grounds for supreme complacency. Or are they? Does Caligastia really belong to what the book is calling the ‘spiritual world’? That depends upon which dictionary definition we may choose. Some indicate that spiritualists communicate with the spiritual world, including the nasty spirits. But another dictionary definition says that ‘spiritual’ pertains to things sacred or holy — which surely would exclude nasty spirits. Does this mean that Caligastia and other nasty spirits, not being members of what the book means by the ‘spiritual world’, can communicate with us directly if we are willing to let them?

This is not a comforting thought for those who indulge in the phenomenon called ‘channelling’. It may mean that the ‘good’ spirits can only communicate with us indirectly through our Thought Adjuster, but that ‘nasty’ spirits can get at us directly.

Ernest Moyer in his Urantia Newsletter No.2, stressed the possibility that many sincere URANTIA Book readers may have unwittingly invited Caligastia into their lives.

If we face the facts, the Urantia movement is a dismal failure. Could Ernest be right — does Caligastia have the movement by the throat, and if so, how did it happen? I do not know of any readers who would knowingly invite Caligastia into their lives, not even some whose actions (in my view), have been enormously disruptive and harmful. So how could it have happened? That question took me back to the section in _The URANTIA Book_ on how Caligastia managed to get at Eve.

There, we are reminded that neither Caligastia or Dalagastia had any power to influence an individual against his will ([UB 75:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p2_1)). All their direct attempts to beguile Adam, Eve, or their children, failed. So Caligastia concluded that his only hope of success was in the adroit employment of suitable persons belonging to the upper strata of the Nodite group. How could he do it? He was visible to and could communicate directly with Adam and Eve — but not to these Nodites. The two Nodites who brought about Eve's downfall were Serapatatia and Cano. The first is described as deeply impressed with the righteousness of Adam's cause, entirely honest and thoroughly sincere in all of his activities and “_never conscious, even later on, that he was being used as a circumstantial tool of the wily Caligastia_”. ([UB 75:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_3))

Cano was the other Nodite involved with Eve. He is described as of brilliant mind, sympathetic with the Adamic regime, the sincere spiritual leader of the Nodites who favoured friendly relations with the Garden. Neither look to be ready-made agents for Caligastia.

The rot set in when:

> “...one day, during a talk with Eve, it occurred to Serapatatia that it would be very helpful if, while awaiting the recruiting of large numbers of the violet race, something could be done in the meantime immediately to advance the needy waiting tribes”.([UB 75:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p3_5))

A hybrid leader of Nodite and violet stock was proposed as the solution. Cano, the Nodite, and Eve, of the violet race, got themselves nominated as parents.

How did this idea get planted in Serapatatia's mind? — for it surely was Caligastia's work. There appear to be just two possibilities. One was that Caligastia managed to have himself invited into the minds of other Nodites who subsequently influenced Serapatatia. The alternative is that Caligastia influenced Serapatatia directly. Since the text clearly indicates that the idea was original with Serapatatia we have to favour the second option. So we might ask why were Serapatatia and Cano especially vulnerable? Perhaps they did not have Thought Adjusters? But from the glowing character descriptions given in the book of these two, that appears to be unlikely. After all, Andon and Fonta had Thought Adjusters.

The clue may be in the description of both as being prominent leaders. Serapatatia was a leader of the Syrian Nodites and was also one of Adam's most able and efficient lieutenants. Cano is introduced as the spiritual leader of those Nodites dwelling in the vicinity of the Garden.

Among we mortals, leaders are usually drawn from one of two groups. One group consists of those with natural leadership ability but little or no desire to lead. Such people tend to have followers rather than themselves seeking to lead. The other group is composed of those with a burning desire to be number one and who may, or may not, have real leadership qualities.

Is it possible that a longing to be important, a longing for recognition among our peers, to be a teacher or a leader, or to be someone special (in reality ego-tripping no matter how we disguise our motives from ourselves), can be enough to open our minds to Caligastia?

The deep-seated craving to be somehow outstanding — is this not Lucifer's disease of self-exaltation ([UB 67:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p1_2)) that may subsequently lead to unbridled self-will, unregulated self-expression, and unmitigated selfishness ([UB 54:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p1_5))? How often have we seen this disease run its full course in political leaders? Did such ego-tripping aspirations in Serapatatia and Cano result in them unconsciously opening up their minds to manipulation by Caligastia? No other conclusion is obvious from the written evidence in _The URANTIA Book_. If so, selfish pride may be the only key required for us to become vulnerable to the wiles of Caligastia. The book has a warning for us. It says:

> “_Of all the dangers which beset man's mortal nature and jeopardize his spiritual integrity, pride is the greatest._” ([UB 111:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_9))

Could there be a point where our self-will becomes so dominant that our Thought Adjuster can no longer influence us and we then become open to the wiles of Caligastia? It is entirely conceivable that such could be the case without us having the slightest awareness of what had happened.

One thing of which we can be completely certain is that Caligastia really did succeed in manipulating the unsuspecting minds of Serapatatia and Cano — and in doing so, he destroyed the Adamic mission. Maybe Ernest Moyer is right then, perhaps Caligastia has done it again within the Urantia movement. The aspiration to stand out from one's fellows is an exceedingly common human fault that often times leads to many kinds of aberrant behaviour.

For Lucifer, there was deliberate and conscious antipathy to the authority of the Universal Father. There is no suggestion that either Serapatatia or Cano, both of whom became efficient tools of Caligastia, had such antipathy. On the contrary, they were eager to support the Adamic mission yet they were responsible for the failure of the mission. Is there a parallel in the Urantia movement? Most, perhaps all, of its problems appear to stem from the desire by individuals to be important, to be special, to be among the chosen, to be leaders. Surely it is necessary for each of us to examine our true motives.

Most Urantian mortals are expert in the art of selfdeceit — we can always rationalise our behaviour, shift the blame elsewhere, and justify our actions, even attributing our selfishly-motivated actions to being for the good of others and in the service of God. While we might succeed in hiding our real motives, they cannot be hidden from God. Perhaps they are also obvious to Caligastia.

The desire to be special or ‘chosen’, and even such apparently innocent thoughts such as “I didn't find the book, it found me”, may be the seeds of a developing pride that can lead to Lucifer's disease of self-exaltation. When we look at the actions of Serapatatia, Cano, and Eve, what we see are ordinary people rationalising their well-meaning actions in terms of ‘the end justifying the means’ — another disease that has also afflicted the Urantia movement. The result for the Adamic mission was an utter disaster for God's divine plans for Urantia. And it definitely was the outcome of the nefarious and unseen scheming of Caligastia. However to have told any of the three major participants that they had fallen under the influence of Caligastia would undoubtedly have brought an amazed and indignant denial.

We need to have a serious re-think about how it might be possible for us to fall into the clutches of the enemy camp. There is adequate evidence available from the appalling failure of the Urantia movement to justify such a re-think.

In _The URANTIA Book_ we have a detailed account of the life and teachings of Jesus to light the pathway for us. We are told that Jesus was a revelation of God. We are told that when Ganid tempted Jesus to put himself forward as teacher and leader, he responded:

> “_I am now on the way to Rome with you and your father, and that is sufficient for today. My tomorrow is wholly in the hands of my Father in heaven._” [UB 130:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p5_3)

Jesus was never in a hurry. He always had time to comfort men “as he passed by.” He was a charming listener. He comforted hungry minds and ministered to thirsty souls. Surely such a personal, loving, unselfish service is the real task that we have each been given by the Fifth Epochal Revelation. When Christianity swept through the Roman Empire, one of the major catalysts became enshrined in this remark from an unknown observer, “See how those Christians love one another.”

Can the same be said of the Urantia movement? I think not. How many have pondered upon the depth of meaning for themselves of those strange words in the beatitudes that are so contrary to the natural aspirations of humans to be prominent: “Happy are the poor is spirit — the humble — for theirs are the treasures of the kingdom of heaven. Happy are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. Happy are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the sons of God.” Considered in this light, how many URANTIA Book readers truly believe that they qualify? The secret of Jesus' unparalleled religious life was his consciousness of the presence of God — not some esoteric, out-of-this-world spirit entity. Jesus attained this consciousness by intelligent prayer and sincere worship — unbroken communion with God — and not by leadings, voices, visions, or extraordinary religious practices ([UB 196:0.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_10)). His advice to us today might well be that recorded in the bible — “Go thou and do likewise.”

### From “The French”

_by Theodore Zeldin (Collins Harvill)._

“I no longer agree with what I taught twenty years ago”, says the Benedictine monk Father Luc, “and indeed I would be ashamed to repeat what I said twenty years ago”.

The Catholic Church in France is no longer what it was. It is not just that Father Luc does not look like a monk, in his rather smart, casual civilian clothes, with no dog collar, no tie, only an inconspicuous small cross attached to a chain around his neck.

More important is that he no longer has the same status or functions that a priest used to have. His job, he says, is no longer “to sell religious merchandise.” He seldom holds services or preaches. He does not even teach religion to children any more, since that has been taken over by professional lay teachers.

He lives a communal life with four or five other monks, but he has become a parish priest, because he found the monastic life not enough by itself. He has spent all his twenty years in the same working-class suburb with a communist municipality, and he has seen his congregation fall by about half in that time: “a quarter left us because we moved too fast and a quarter because we did not move fast enough”.

He does not try to be a missionary among the unfaithful. Fewer than five people a week come to him seeking the traditional confession. Religion has ceased to mean primarily taking the sacraments or attending church. Instead, Father Luc spends most of his time helping people to reflect on their faith.

He helps to form little groups, by district, or just a few friends, who meet with priests to discuss the way they live, and the way they experience their faith. He takes part in the discussion with no superior authority: “we are converted as well as they”; he has been as much influenced by the changing attitudes of the laity as they have by him.

### When all is said and done.

> “_And it will not be by the words you speak but by the lives you live that men will know that you have been with me and have learned of the realities of the kingdom._” ([UB 140:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p1_7))
