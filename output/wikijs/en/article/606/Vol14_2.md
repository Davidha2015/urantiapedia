## Editor's Notebook

What is the blend of a revelation with the ethos that is a nation? Is the mix likely to be favourable to long-term integration one with the other? Is there an embryonic harmony in any nation to truly herald this new revelation?

Reform's lack of pace suits Australia admirably. Ideologies evaporate in a psyche that has difficulty in taking life too seriously. A healthy irreverence to religion will win out over attitudes of irrelevance. With such unconcern, how can we as a nation disintegrate from any fundamentalism.

However we do run the risk of indifference. For many, life is too good as is and there appears no need for seeking the kingdom.

Incredibly, this malady is not likely to be disturbed by our ethnic diversity. Hatreds, except for civil unrest within cultures, are inexplicably left in homelands.

When you're local, you're not so vocal.

We do not muse over territory and borders as do our ancestors in Europe. We have not the diametrically opposed particularism of a fading American dream to which we too once aspired. The gentler influence of a South East Asian environment is settling on our shores, the shores we cling to, sunbathe on, and don't defend.

God is no respecter of nations, true enough. A receptivity, a propensity though, is something else.

While our understanding of religion is no more blessed than in other nations, it is blurred rather than fanatical divisions that cause rivalry. Isolated bushfires are not fueling an inferno.

We are a mixture of races and beliefs with a tolerance bred of ignorance rather than mistrust.

We find interest and adventure in cultural differences. Mighty Messengers, observers, planetary pilgrims they could all land here and we would want to know: “Ow yer goin', orright?”

But challenge us without substance, ridicule us for mediocrity, foist a religion upon us, and you've got a problem.

What has shaped this character? Essentially our independence. For instance, we just voted against the political viewpoint of all the major press editorials.

And organizations such as The Institute of Public Affairs, The Centre for Independent Studies, The Tasman Institute, and the Evatt Foundation, all have a say on social, economic, environmental and immigration issues.

Who then, we must ask, controls the agenda on religion? Traditional values are lingering tenuously.

New religious ideas will take root. Not from within we still discredit our own as a national pastime — but from the infiltration of a global culture. We'll just have to see if our conservatism recognises the value system and stability of revelatory teachings rather than seeing it as a philosophy of change.

Revelation cannot impose. But its moderate assimilation will not be hindered by a clutter of social and economic dislocations in this isolated land.

The very thought of this nation showing tolerance to a revelation is a bit of a joke really. In Australia, a big ideal is no big deal!

## So They Say

**Edward William Cole (Creator Of Cole's Book Arcade)**

On reviewers of books: They are the channels through which the influence flows that makes the difference between the wise and, well — the otherwise.

**Heinemann Editor**

The enduring books endure because there is something that happens between the public and the author. Richard Neville (Social Commentator)

The great thing about Australia is its rich potential for happiness, but we feel defensive because we're not crisis ridden. Our very affability that's being attacked is a resource the world may need one day.

**Lauchlan Chipman (Academic)**

Contemporary Australian society is notable for its willingness to debate social and philosophical issues. If we were France, for example, we would be proud of taking a philosophical role and trying to turn philosophical issues into social concerns. But we are dogged by the influence of that northern English rhetoric which emphasises the practical and the useful over the philosophical and the intellectual. If you tell the average Australian you're a philosopher, he's likely to ask, what's your day job?

**Mary Kostakidis (Australian Newsreader)**

The new generation is the generation of consequence. They are more realistic and understand the consequences of what we do. I have faith in young Australia because they have this sense. It is a concern that must lead to action. We didn't realise that the world had a use-by date.

## Letters To The Editor

### _The Urantia Book_ In Four Parts?

_A. Dalton, USA_

Conjure up in your mind Michelangelo's magnificent sculpture ‘David’. One person's favorite part may be the face with its strong, youthful, masculine features. Another person's favorite part may be the muscular, rotated torso. Still another person's favorite part may be the strong but gentle hands. But who would want to detach their favorite part from the splendid, extraordinary whole, which needs all of the parts in order to achieve a certain effect? And this effect might be interpreted as the superb capturing in marble of youthfulness, virility, grace, innocence, beauty, and strength.

Now imagine that _The URANTIA Book_ is an exquisitely beautiful piece of sculpture, the whole of which is greater than the sum of its parts. Although its parts can be enjoyed and appreciated apart from the whole, they are enhanced manyfold by their being seen as part of a magnificent whole.

Each paper of _The URANTIA Book_ can be seen as one candle. And when you put all of those candles together, you get not just 197 candles. You get something much, much more. You get a beacon.

Break up the book? ... no, I don't think so.

This letter was received in response to Keith Bacon's suggestion to print _The URANTIA Book_ in four parts.

### Food For Thought

_Ed Roache, Watertown, New York, USA_

Modern scholars estimate it took Mary and Joseph 6 days to travel from Nazareth to Jerusalem. _The URANTIA Book_ states this journey took two and a half days Joseph walking, and 9 months pregnant Mary on a horse, walking behind. The distance is about 90 miles. Travelling at 3 miles per hour for 12 hours per day would make this possible. This is extraordinary by today's standards, but not impossible to my mind. What do other readers think?

### “Variety — The Dice Of Life?” Revisited <Br> Allan Lane, Mirrabooka, Western Australia

In the previous issue's article of the above title, the intended question mark was omitted. I would like to alert readers that I used the word ‘code’ and its derivatives unclearly in certain cases. The substitution of words such as ‘instructions’, ‘information’, and ‘message’ will in many cases better explain my intention. Apologies for any mental breakdowns that may have been triggered.

## News Around The World

### Ordination Of Women — Heresy!

The Presbyterian Church of New South Wales has charged Dr Peter Cameron with heresy for saying that St Paul's letter to Timothy (2:13) was wrong. He challenged arguments against the ordination of women.

Dr Cameron, Principal of the University of Sydney's St Andrew's College has the support of the University Council which has good standing with the Presbyterian Church of Australia.

There is a political agenda behind the trial. The Uniting Church (formed by liberals with the Methodists in 1986) and Continuing Presbyterians are fighting over property, especially schools. Court action and high legal fees have resulted.

More scholars are recognizing the Bible as a first century document reflecting that time and its set of social circumstances. They see fundamentalists treating it as a legal document which gives a set of precedents for all sorts of later actions.

With all the clamour of academic dignity, use and misuse of scripture, theological emphasis and freedom of speech, Dr Cameron is seen as both a sinner and a martyr.

People in a secular society no doubt see this as another example of irresponsible intolerance.

The church's diminishing ranks must again address the authority of the bible, and somewhere in it, strive to find the teachings of Jesus.

### Book Tax

The Australian book industry, a billion dollar a year business, faced an annual $150 million consumption tax if a Liberal government had been elected.

There are currently no tariffs, sales tax, or other direct imposts within the manufacturing, importing, or distribution process.

We could have expected a significant drop in book sales, in line with the reports from Canada and New Zealand where consumption taxes have been recently introduced.

In Britain, books are exempt from their value added tax (VAT).

### Women Would Make The World A Better Place

A report of the UN International Labour Organisation says six of only 179 membership nations of the UN have a woman as head of State. Women occupy only 3.5 percent of cabinet posts. The ILO says an increase in the number of women at the top would make a huge difference in the quality of decision-making in the world.

“Women tend to speak with a different voice, which as a rule lays stress on the social ethos of development, that is to say education, health, children, environment, dialogue and peace; men tend to concentrate on the economic aspects such as production, trade profitability, finance, technology and national defence,” it says.

“If we really aspire to any development of the human lot involving both economic growth and social equity, the best way to achieve this will be by having men and women sharing in decision-taking.”

Based on trends, the report forecast it would take five centuries for women to gain the same access as men to management positions, and a further 475 years to get equal representation in the “higher echelons of political and economic power.”

Women hold more than 40 per cent of management jobs in Australia, the United States and Canada. Both Japan and South Korea have 8.3 per cent and 4 percent of management posts occupied by women.

### Question Time

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Qld_

Excuse me, but at the risk of appearing inquisitive, may I ask you:

- Are you more resourceful in revealing goodness to humanity today than you were yesterday?
- Are you a better righteousness recommender this year than you were last year?
- Are your ideals sufficiently high to ensure your eternal salvation while your ideas are so practical as to render you a useful citizen to function on Urantia in association with your mortal fellows?
- As you grow older in and more experienced in the affairs of the kingdom, are you becoming more tactful in dealing with troublesome mortals and more tolerant in living with stubborn associates?

Alright, I will come clean. Jesus at Tyre (1737-1741) suggested to his apostles that they ask themselves these questions (among others), and to my mind this really presupposes that we really consciously appraise what we think, feel and do. Jesus wants us to take note of where we are and how we are progressing.

He also respectfully suggests a few desirable characteristics which we should strive towards acquiring. In typical fashion, he defines what he means and points to the benefits of the concept.

> “_Tact is the fulcrum of social leverage, and tolerance is the earmark of a great soul. If you possess these rare and charming gifts, as the days pass you will become more alert and expert in your worthy efforts to avoid all unnecessary social misunderstandings. Such wise souls are able to avoid much of the trouble which is certain to be the portion of all who suffer from lack of emotional adjustment, those who refuse to grow up, and those who refuse to grow old gracefully._” ([UB 156:5.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_18))

Now I know he calls them gifts, and gifts indeed they are, for anything of value that I acquire is through the grace of God and the dedicated enterprise of my Thought Adjuster. Time and time again I have told him to bulldoze his way through the resistance of my will, such as when I am asleep. Unfortunately this is not God's way. However, he has made it easy for me by giving me _The URANTIA Book_. Before receiving it, I might have believed tactlessness and intolerance were to be my ideals. I sure was surrounded by them. Now with assurance and determination, I grit my teeth and strive for the acquirement of these gifts, so very, very rare on this planet.

After I get them I am going to learn not to “_grow weary in well-doing because I (he) am (is) thwarted._” ([UB 156:5.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_21)) This means that because the experience of my past may have been disappointing, I will not change my pattern of behaviour. I will continue to love, trust, value and offer assistance to every person I meet. If they respond by gnawing at my proffered hand, it may, in the interests of my striving to be “wise as a serpent” necessitate my removing my presence to ensure that I am “as gentle as a dove”. However, this experience will in no way lessen my resolve to continue to greet every new person in like manner, and similarly approach the hand gnawer if circumstance necessitates us interacting again at some future time.

When I have got that down to a fine art I am going to “_seek no unearned recognition and crave no undeserved sympathy._” ([UB 156:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_19)) Consequently “to God the glory” for anything I may achieve which those around deem worthy of congratulations and praise $(mmm, this will be a rather irregular occurrence, I suspect). And when I defy universal laws with abandon, and give advice when it is neither requested nor desired, I will no longer look to the starry heights at night anticipating a “this is my beloved daughter in whom I am well pleased”. Now will I expect my Thought Adjuster to wipe the tears of my wisdom, born of repeated stupidity.

By the time I acquire all of these characteristics I suspect I may have difficulty finding kindred spirits on Urantia. In an attempt to protect myself against this eventuality, may I make a request. Let's synchronize desires. What fun if we readers could become tactful, tolerant, seek no unearned recognition, stop looking for sympathy, and simply spend each day in invigorating “well-doing”.

### The Teaching Mission. “If Not Actual Personalities, Then What?”

_Robert L. Blackstock, Concord, California, USA_

The channelling activity in the Urantia movement, called the ‘Teaching Mission’ by its supporters, poses an interesting question for those who cannot accept the activity for what it purports to be. Of course, the activity purports to be the opening of the circuits of communication between mortals here on Urantia and the unseen spiritual and morontial personalities involved in the guidance of Urantia. The interesting question is: If not actual personalities, then what? What plausible explanation is there for these manifestations, other than they are what they purport to be? To merely give the activity a label explains little. Statements such as ‘it is all in the mind’, ‘split personality’, ‘alter ego’, etc., without the underlying argument and details, leaves a thinking person cold, or even disposes him or her to consider the contrary position more seriously.

What I am doing in this brief article, is referring the person who is asking the above question to an essay by psychologist Carl Jung, entitled ‘On the Nature of the Psyche’ (1954), which is published in The Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 8, pages 159-234. (The Collected Works consists of about twenty volumes and each is now available in paperback.) The essay, which deals with the structure, and dynamics of what we know, as students of _The URANTIA Book_, to be the material mind, goes a long way in providing a model for understanding how channelled material manifests in the material mind. Such an understanding is important whether the manifestation is spiritual in nature or ‘merely’ psychological. It should be kept in mind that everything we experience is, in the most fundamental sense, psychological, whether inner experience or external stimulus.

For us, with our material minds, spiritual experience and psychological experience are always a mix, and trying to prove whether a manifestation is one or the other will almost always be an exercise in futility. However, it is essential to have a satisfactory model for interpreting such manifestations, and to gain a psychological understanding if we are to end the confusion and divisiveness in the Urantia movement regarding such phenomena, for until we have gained an adequate understanding, we are likely to see such message and channelling phenomena continue, or repeat itself in different forms. 

#### I

It is fairly well known that Jung postulates two areas of the unconscious, a personal unconscious and the collective unconscious. (His hypothesis or model of the collective unconscious has aspects in common with _The URANTIA Book_'s “_functional existence of the superconscious_” ([UB 100:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_9)) and the “cosmic mind”, in the sense expressed at [UB 111:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_2), “_Intellectual selves have their origin in the cosmic mind much as nebulae take origin in the cosmic energies of universe space._”) As implied by the term “collective unconscious”, one of its main characteristics is that it is common to us all, like the air we breathe; all of our minds are connected with or in this collective unconscious and thereby share common material.

This idea of a common substratum underlying our individual consciousnesses is the key to understanding how something like “the Teaching Mission” can occur. As discussed below, the concept of a limited collective unconscious which is unique to the Urantia movement subculture can account for the otherwise perplexing phenomena of manifestations of similar or related material by channellers in different geographical locations.

In Jung's model, the collective unconscious has different levels e.g. the human race has a common level, Western man and the Orient each have theirs, European man and America, the nations, clans, even families have their common unconscious. This model is well established by the evidence acquired through study of legends, myths, art, etc., and it is an essential tool for understanding the functioning of the human mind.

The constituent elements of the collective unconscious are archetypes, basic patterns or inclinations underlying thought. These archetypes are common to all humanity at the broader or deeper levels of the collective unconscious, and become less extensive (less universal) in the newer or less broad levels (e.g., nations, clans). As inner experiences they often appear as a subject with apparent perception, thinking, feeling, volition and intention, in short, they appear as personalities. We ourselves being personalities, tend to experience inner mindal urges or patterns (archetypes) as personalities.

...the concept of a limited collective

unconscious which is unique to the Urantia movement subculture can account for the otherwise perplexing phenomena of manifestations of similar or related material by channellers in different geographical locations.

Whatever the archetypal material may be in itself, it is real, or represents reality. Just as our evolutionary experiences have set down archetypes in the collective unconscious, so are there archetypes residing in the collective unconscious the source of which is spiritual reality, from the Adjutant Mind Spirits, information from the superconscious. Archetypes generally have a significant energy component; the more archaic or distant, long established but still unconscious archetypes are, the greater their energy, and if conditions are propitious, then such material can manifest or erupt into consciousness.

#### II

Over the past several decades, starting with Dr Sadler and the early forum, there has developed a subculture or ‘clan’ of readers of _The URANTIA Book_ (and others who accept the book but who may not read it that much). If various races, nations and even families have their own collective unconscious, it follows that in the Urantia movement subculture, there is developing a collective unconscious around the concepts and information in _The URANTIA Book_. This (limited) collective unconscious is unique to the Urantia movement, and is not found in the general culture.

Much of the material (concepts, images) found in _The URANTIA Book_ exists in the older, broader levels of the collective unconscious (of mind), but generally does not erupt into consciousness, because the general culture has no reality sense in its consciousness of such material e.g. an invisible celestial government guiding us and our planet. However, in the Urantia movement, in addition to its collective unconscious (described in the previous paragraph), there has also developed a collective consciousness, consisting of these ideas in _The URANTIA Book_, which also correspond to a great extent with the oldest, most energy laden archetypes (e.g. the hero and teacher archetypes). A pathway or bridge has been established between this collective consciousness in the Urantia movement, and the older, more distant archetypes (actually established in large part by the Adjutant Mind Spirits over millions of years).

So we have the archetypes from the collective unconscious attaching and infusing energy into images and concepts in the Urantia movement's collective consciousness; the gulf which ordinarily keeps these two distinct levels apart is bridged by the Urantia movement's collective unconscious, the intermediate level which is not far distant, relatively, from each of the others.

#### III

One dramatic result of these developments is that, just knowing about the book, and maybe having read it only a little, or merely hearing of the concepts and information in it, can hook a person into the reality sense of the Urantia movement's collective consciousness, and create an identification between the person and the Urantia movement on the unconscious level and thereby people with little knowledge of the contents of the book, new readers, etc. may be channellers, and material pours forth which they cannot possibly know consciously.

In the spiritualistic/parapsychological literature, as reported by William James, Jung, and a number of lesser known students of such phenomena, many cases of group manifestations can be found wherein individuals in different geographical locations independently produce related material e.g. different parts of a single message. Under certain conditions, identical or similar material will manifest in people in different geographical locations, independent of cause and effect.

What conditions? Usually an energy-charged condition, such as impending disaster, or tense expectation, will be found in connection with such group manifestations. The collapse of the Urantia Foundation and Brotherhood relationship, and the removal of the book from normal distribution channels, among other developments in the Urantia movement, may have been the precipitating events for the unconscious group phenomena we are now witnessing.

#### IV

I have heard arguments in support of the “Teaching Mission” to the effect that we should be willing to recognize and accept truth regardless of the source, and that our inner guidance is sufficient to tell us whether or not something is true. In response to that position I would say that the human mind has been evolving with the guidance of the Adjutant Mind Spirits and a host of other spiritual influences for millions of years. We now have consciousness, will and reason. Inner experience should be pursued, but these hard-gained rigorous human attributes of will and reason should be kept close by.

_The URANTIA Book_ mentions at UB 34:4.13 that:

> “_The four points of the compass are universal and inherent in the life of Nebadon. All living creatures (including mankind on Urantia) possess bodily units which are sensitive and responsive to these directional currents._” [UB 34:4.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p4_13)

As we do not hesitate, when we are traveling unfamiliar roads, to get out the roadmap to supplement our inherent magnetic compass, we should likewise not fail to utilize the psychological viewpoint as a supplement to our personal inner experience.

#### Conclusion

The foregoing is an effort to address the question, “Channeling, if not actual personalities, then what?” It is difficult material and impossible to write anything very meaningful in such short space, and my intention was to refer the reader to Jung's essay mentioned above. This psychological viewpoint is not inconsistent with the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_. On the contrary, they have much in common and to a great extent are mutually confirming, and the study of each in light of the other proves very interesting. Such an approach can be a fascinating undertaking, and at the same time provide that necessary grounding, without which the material in _The URANTIA Book_ can be disruptive to the human psyche, in both the individual and the group.

### Spiritual Vision

_Ron Cyr, Blaine, USA_

Having been a reader of _The URANTIA Book_ for twenty years, and a conference ‘groupie’ for the last ten years, I have been aware, as are a lot of other readers, that the Fifth Epochal Revelation has not shown much progress since its infancy on Urantia almost forty years ago. A lot of blame has been put on the Grimsley affair, the split with the Foundation, the apathy of the readers, the restriction of the sale of the book or whatever. If I may, I would like to bring another point of view of why some of us, or should I say most of us, are groping in the dark for directions, never being certain if the decisions being taken are the right ones.

The common denominator in the five revelations is that each one has a spiritual origin. There is also a common denominator for the first three revelations in that spiritual vision came with the personalities charged with bringing them. For the fourth revelation, although the origin was spiritual, spiritual vision did not come ready-made with Jesus. In time, it was attained by the way he lived his life on Urantia.

The Fifth Revelation is unique. Though also of spiritual origin, no personality endowed with spiritual vision has come with it. The spiritual vision will have to be provided by those human beings who have searched the revelation and aspired to that vision.

No vision gives no results; human vision gives human results; spiritual vision gives spiritual results.

Can a human being, or a group, attain a spiritual vision by means of human vision? My answer is irrevocably — no. Human vision cannot give spiritual results any more than a child in kindergarten can teach quantum physics. Human vision originates from a material human brain ‘that thinks that it thinks’. Spiritual vision originates from a higher source. A human vision is from time and projected in time. A spiritual vision is from beyond time and extended in time.

Naturally the question is “what is it to have a spiritual vision?” To be honest I do not know. With the help of _The URANTIA Book_ maybe we can find out what happens when the spiritual vision in a revelation is missing, ceases to be, or is not there. From there we might develop a glimpse of what it is, which will give us the light to follow it through. The more that a human being learns what God is not, the closer that human being gets to know God as He is. Analogously, knowing what a spiritual vision is not, or what happens when it is not present, may be the beginning of knowing what a spiritual vision is.

> Human Vision Cannot Give Spiritual Results Any More Than A Child In kindergarten can teach quantum physics.

When the First Revelation arrived, since Caligastia and his entourage were spiritual beings, by the law of logic they had to have spiritual vision. When the rebellion struck Caligastia and his acolytes, they replaced in their minds the spiritual vision they had brought with them with the teachings of Lucifer. Their vision was now Lucifer's vision. By replacing spiritual vision with Lucifer's vision, the whole plan came to a screeching halt. But Van and Amadon kept the original spiritual vision alive until Adam and Eve arrived.

The Second Revelation also came with a spiritual vision. Adam and Eve kept it alive even after they defaulted. But when they died that was the end of it. We are told that the default of Adam and Eve was more disastrous than the Caligastia upheaval (382). The Caligastia upheaval precipitated world-wide confusion and robbed all subsequent generations of the moral assistance which a well-ordered society would have provided. But even more disastrous was the Adamic default in that it deprived the races of that superior type of physical nature which would have been more consonant with spiritual aspirations.

I believe that another reason that compounded the problems was that, for the first time, Urantia had nobody with a spiritual vision. So from then on it was all downhill.
After the default the ‘light of life’ almost vanished. It was getting so serious that an emergency revelation appeared under the direction of Melchizedek (389). He volunteered to incarnate in the likeness of mortal flesh and did so with the approval of the Melchizedek receivers of the planet who feared that the ‘light of life’ would become extinguished during that period of increasing spiritual darkness. And he did foster the truth of his day and safely pass it on to Abraham and his associates.

For 94 years we were again blessed with spiritual vision and that was enough to carry the ball until the appearance of Jesus. But the Fourth Epochal Revelation did not come endowed with spiritual vision. It had to be attained by the way Jesus lived his life on Urantia.

As much as he tried, Jesus could not get the apostles to elevate themselves to his level of thinking. We are told in _The URANTIA Book_ that the apostles did, in a way, fail in their mission to carry the vision that Jesus was trying to extend to them. In fact, the Spirit of Truth gave the apostles more spiritual vision than they obtained during all the time that they spent with Jesus. But they could not entirely let go of their human vision of what they thought the Christ (Messiah) should have been. So they ended up with a spiritual vision mixed with a human vision which, in return, gave a lot of spiritual results mixed with human results.

Would _The URANTIA Book_ have been given to us if the apostles had not failed in their mission? I do believe that one reason why the book has been given to us is “to remedy where the apostles failed”. We readers of _The URANTIA Book_ must provide the missing link if this revelation is to succeed.

Personally I am not conscious of having a spiritual vision but in all of us there can reside the Spirit of Truth which does have it. I firmly believe that, to attain spiritual vision, the first thing for me to do is to recognize my most vital need to have it. In time, if I keep that desire uppermost in my thoughts, then I might be blessed with it. Even if I never gain consciousness of it, just because of the fact that I want it above anything else, my actions will tend to harmonize with that vision — and the Spirit of Truth will coordinate my actions with those of other people involved in the same search and with the same goal. Whether such people are cognizant of one another is irrelevant.

The Movers and Shakers of this beautiful revelation will be the ones who are unafraid to act with enthusiastic dedication. But being known as a Mover and Shaker is immaterial, the Spirit of Truth is the hero.

I hope that I have been able to show that a spiritual revelation can only be led, run, or directed with a spiritual vision if it is to go anywhere. The lack of it will entail a lack of spiritual results. A company can be run with a human vision — but not a revelation.

Be of good cheer and the Vision be with us all.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### The Australian Conference 1993

It is with great pleasure that we announce the 1993 Australian Conference for readers of _The URANTIA Book_

## The Venue

The world famous Sea World Nara Resort set in lush tropical gardens on the Queensland Gold Coast, just south of Brisbane. Only hundreds of secluded acres of bushland and sand dunes separate the resort from the sparkling waters of the Pacific Ocean.

### The Theme

WELCOME TO THE SHORES OF PARADISE.

“You may be certain of being warmly welcomed when you experience the resurrection into eternity on the everlasting shores of Paradise.” (283)

### The Purpose

During our three day sojourn at this physical paradise we can share insights on how we envisage we can spiritually grow and traverse the realms to The Central Isle of Paradise.

“The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind.” (2097)

Jesus developed superlative techniques to effect the process. He often engaged in solitary commune with the Father — to gather strength, to seek new stores of wisdom, to find better ways to subject his total personality to the consciousness of divinity contact.

In this and no doubt many other ways, Jesus resolved ordinary conflicts of living and also the higher problems of a moral and spiritual nature.

We are bid to do likewise.

### Does The End Ever Justify Unworthy Means?

_Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

According to _The URANTIA Book_, the Adamic default was more disastrous for us than the Lucifer rebellion. The reason — we missed out on having our genes upgraded, we have a gross deficiency of the violet race genes. These would have made us taller and increased the duration of our lives, but neither attribute has any obvious deleterious repercussions. The big loss seems to have been our potential for spiritual growth (382:4).

The book tells us that this loss can be at least partially negated:

> “_Jesus showed mankind the new way of mortal living whereby human beings may very largely escape the dire consequences of the Caligastia rebellion and most effectively compensate for the deprivations resulting from the Adamic default._” ([UB 34:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_6))

The ‘way’ that Jesus showed us was, of course, his life and the way he lived. The book tells us:

> “_To follow Jesus means to personally share his religious faith and to enter into the spirit of the Master's life of unselfish service for man. One of the most important things in human living is to find out what Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement of his exalted life purpose. Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it._” ([UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3))

Apparently the apostle Philip was especially lacking in spirituality and needed some extra instruction. After the resurrected Jesus had told Philip that eventually he would be blessed with spiritual vision and do great work, he gave Philip this admonition:

> “_In the meantime, become as a little child in the kingdom of the spirit and permit me, as the spirit of the new teacher, to lead you forward in the spiritual kingdom. And in this way will I be able to do much for you which I was not able to accomplish when I sojourned with you as a mortal of the realm._” ([UB 181:2.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/181#p2_20))

Philip's spiritual vision would come only after he received the Spirit of Truth.

Since Pentecost, the bringing of the gift of spiritual vision has been a major function of the Spirit of Truth. But the book reminds us that the Spirit of Truth does not make us conscious of himself. Rather, he increases our consciousness of Jesus ([UB 194:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_4)). How can we enhance that consciousness?

An insight into the answer to this question is provided by Charles M. Sheldon in a book entitled ‘In His Steps’ that has a place on the list of the top ten best selling books for all time.

It was first published in 1895 and is set in the U.S.A. in a typical industrialized city for that time. The industrial revolution had bifurcated society into a large, povertystricken, slum-dwelling, whisky-drinking working class, living in sin and squalor, and a smaller, church-going, wealthy upper class living in self-righteous isolation. An unusual incident induced the minister from one of the wealthiest churches in the city to commit himself for a whole year to live his life with all of his actions based upon what he believed Jesus would do in the same circumstances. Many parishioners felt challenged to do the same. Other church congregations followed suit. The result was that, in a multitude of different situations, people were asking themselves, “What would Jesus have done”. The book tells the story of their experiences.

Many modern readers will wonder how this book ever became a best seller. Its description of the social conditions and the attitudes within society in 1895 seem unrealistic — even naive. But maybe this is only so because enough people really did respond to the challenge to change society by asking themselves that vital question “What would Jesus do ?” Far fetched! Perhaps not — after all, the book is a best seller of all time.

Following the receipt of first news in Australia of the split between the Urantia Brotherhood and the Urantia Foundation, pressure was exerted on many of us to make a stand for one side or the other. For reasons unknown to me, in discussion I insisted on applying the criterion “What would Jesus have done?” to information about the actions of both parties — with unfavourable results for both. I was told by some (including a Foundation trustee) that this cannot be done in the real world. Initially, the same response was given by the majority of church-goers described in Sheldon's book. But later, they discovered otherwise.

What would Jesus really have done in the circumstances of the myriad of problems that have confronted members of the Urantia movement over the last half century? Just for the asking, the Spirit of Truth is available to make us conscious of what Jesus' attitude would be — and to grant us spiritual vision.

Some of the movement's problems appear to have their origin in the concept that the morality of any action is determined by its underlying motive, an attitude that quickly deteriorates into the Machiavellian dictum that “the end justifies the means”. Historians have been able to show that many altruistically-based projects for the betterment of human society have come to grief when the use of unworthy means was assumed to be justified on the basis of the ends being worthy.

Among the fallen were the ambitions of Machiavelli for the unification of Italy, and the reconstruction of society by idealistic socialists and communists. Currently we see the foundering of many movements that have adopted the Machiavellian dictum. In the last century, the Marx-Engels manifesto made that concept its official policy for the world revolution of the working classes. This movement originated in response to the pressure of appalling social injustice. Starting from the highly worthy motive “from each according to his ability, to each according to his need” it finally degenerated into the bestiality of the Stalin regime, and the communist regimes in, for example, Rumania and Red China.

> Historians have been able to show that many altruistically-based projects for the betterment of human society have come to grief when the use of unworthy means was assumed to be justified on the basis of the ends being worthy.

The adoption of the principle of the end justifies the means in the Urantia movement is evident as early as 1955 in documents in the files of the Executive Committee of the URANTIA Brotherhood. One such document states: “We have been instructed to remain silent concerning aught we may know about the origin of _The URANTIA Book_ throughout the remainder of our lives”. Then, discussing another document in preparation that would cite only those passages in the book itself that comment on origin, the authors recommend “that we blast as unfactual any other statements which may be made by any person”. Though the motive may have been praiseworthy, the recommendation was to tell lies.

Then there was the deceit concerning the obtaining and maintaining of the copyright and trademarks, the deceit associated with unwarranted textual alterations made to the book, the lies being told and unethical practices being used in a current court case — all justified by supposedly worthy motives. It seems that the use of unworthy means to gain what are deemed to be worthy ends acts like a malignant cancer generating evil in a geometrical progression.

What would Jesus have done? Quite frankly, if such acts were really authorized by celestial authority then I personally would have no desire to proceed to the mansion worlds and beyond. But I do not believe that my soul is in the slightest danger. I simply refuse to believe that any kind of improper action could have had divine authorization — regardless of the supposed worthiness of the motive.

“What would Jesus have done?” Let's take another look in _The URANTIA Book_ for guidance. When the soldiers came to arrest Jesus at Gethsemene, all the disciples except John ran for cover. Hiding among the olive trees as Jesus is led away, I can imagine myself being in Peter's position and thinking to myself: "How can I help my beloved Master — what can I do? Nothing — except to follow at a distance that ensures I am not observed. But better get rid of this sword — incriminating evidence.

I follow to the gate of the palace of Annas. John sees me at the entrance. He knows the girl at the gate and tells her to let me into the courtyard. She does so but then she comes and asks me if I am one of Jesus' disciples when she knows full well that I am. What could I do? So I deny it. Then she wants to torment me and asks again so everyone can hear. I deny it with much swearing and cursing to emphasize my point. Later another servant puts it to me and again I have to pretend not to know Jesus, to deny him. I couldn't do anything else, could I? But I wish I had not been forced to use that bad language in denying him."

I have often given serious thought to what I really would have done in Peter's place. To be honest, I think if I had been Peter, I would have done much the same. I probably would have convinced myself that my motive was the highest — to help Jesus. I could not have done that by hiding like a coward among the olive trees. And if I had declared myself in that courtyard, I would have been arrested. What good would that have achieved? So I did what was expedient — nothing wrong with that.

Then I see Jesus as he is led away. “Oh, my God! Why did Jesus look at me like that? Doesn't the end sometimes justify the means?” (1981:2)

The book says:

> “_It requires a great and noble character, having started out wrong, to turn about and go right. All too often one's own mind tends to justify continuance in the path of error when once it is entered upon._” ([UB 184:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p2_12))

It is inconceivable that the Spirit of Truth would guide us to deliberately embrace unworthy means to attain a goal. Eve tried it and reaped both rebuke and genetic disaster for the rest of us. Because of that, our inherent potential for spiritual growth and spiritual vision is extremely limited.

If we are to overcome our genetic deficiencies it seems that we have two things to do. We need to know the life of Jesus. We can get that from the book. At the same time we need to get in closer touch with the Spirit of Truth. Having realized these objectives, is there a better way to put them into effect than that recommended in Sheldon's book? That is to ask: “What would Jesus have done?” Then doing it.

## On Reflection

### From The Great Literacy Debate

_Edited By David Myers, Australian Scholarly Publishing._

Some years ago, Bernard Shaw observed that England and America were two countries separated by the same language. The same socio-linguistic observation might well be made of America and Australia today.

It is clear that in Australia, as in the western world generally, there is an inevitable division between high and low culture. The functional literacy required for survival in the world of low culture is pretty basic. Being able to barrack for your favourite football team with meat pie and sauce in one corner of your mouth and beer in the other is, of course, a gift not to be sneezed at. Each culture requires different skills.

Literacy for high culture is inextricably bound up with serious literature. It is sad that serious literature has an unenviable reputation among the general public and certainly among the commercial media for being simply too intellectual, too abstruse, too inaccessible for ordinary people to enjoy. This was not always so in Australia. In the literary golden age of the 1890s the literature of Henry Lawson and Banjo Patterson and Steele Rudd was eminently accessible to ordinary people and formed a great part of our national consciousness and identity. It is a mark of the lack of spiritual depth in western society today that commercial publishers promote, and people buy in huge editions, works like Colleen McCullough's ‘The Thorn Birds’ and Stephen King's ghoulish horror entertainments and, further, that works such as these find their way almost automatically onto the mass electronic media as serials or feature films, for this is the nature of low-culture literacy.

Contemporary works of Australian literature which offer a serious spiritual challenge to our mindless lifestyle such as Patrick White's ‘A Fringe of Leaves’ or David Malouf's ‘The Great World’ or Thea Astley's ‘Beachmasters’ or Tom Winton's ‘Cloudstreet’ or works from the third world like Pramoedyra Ananta Toer's ‘Awakenings’ are virtually ignored by the commercial electronic media. They are thought to be too difficult for a public which is seeking a ‘quick fix’ in diversion, sensual entertainment and fast-food equivalent gratification. As US novelist, playwright and poet Dan Marquis said, “publishing a book of poems (or fiction or essays) in today's electronic world is like dropping a rose petal down the Grand Canyon and waiting for an echo”.

Literacy and high culture are elitist insofar as they aim to challenge readers with the most profound, the most spiritual and the most tragic treatments of their themes. Everyone who is willing to work at the understanding of great literature is affirming the value and the distinctiveness of high-culture literacy. We shall never produce a wise and spiritually literate Australia until we accept the division of our society into low culture and high culture and happily spend some more of our tax money on maintaining national institutions like the ABC and SBS in such a way that these institutions can broadcast more reviews, discussions, readings and dramatisations of good Australian and foreign literature. To hell with producing a Clever Australia! What about producing an Artistically Literate, Spiritual and Ecological Australia!

Now, I have admittedly phrased these arguments in a rhetorically loaded way. Pardon me, my prejudices are showing. And I have only personal experience and anecdotal evidence to give some flimsy support to my prejudices.

Let us start again in a more dignified, tolerant fashion. Perhaps the complaints of university lecturers and senior high school teachers about the sinking literacy standards of their students today ignore the basic demographic point that we are now trying to give an advanced level education to up to 50 per cent of our youth, instead of the 5 per cent whom we used to regard as an intellectual elite suited for our universities.

The search for a convenient scapegoat on whom to blame this alleged drop in grammatical standards inflames the passions as the buck is passed from schoolteachers to parents and finally to the indifference of a whole society which has allegedly been seduced into electronic communications at the cost of sophistication in written communication.

There is a much wider problem today with the achieving of literacy in Australia and the western world generally. This problem is one of values and priorities. Love of language for its own sake and respect for literacy are low down on people's priority lists. The majority of our population seems not particularly concerned that after the lapse of a thousand years the greatness of a civilization is not commonly measured by its industrial production or its balance of payments. It is measured by its contribution to philosophy, art, architecture, education and literature.
