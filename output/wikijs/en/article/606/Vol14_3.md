## Editor's Notebook

The communication agenda in the Urantia Movement is for mainstream readers only. This is domination by a minority interest, given total book sales. It is time to recognize the many classifications of readers and to consider their particular needs.

Just for starters:

- The earnest and communicating reader
- The 'spin off reader who is looking for a way to use the information
- The home-based and private reader
- The friend of a reader
- Those who are going to read it ‘one day’
- Those who've heard about it

The list could go on. Readers don't need to follow any program, gravitate to any one place, be it study group or city, and their pace and level of interest is entirely their own.

We experience the book. Like the modern working career, life changes course, prosperity is made and lost, status is strictly temporary, and we never retire.

So too, there is no certainty that someone hears about the book, traverses various stages of readership, to finally join the ‘professional circuit’.

It is not a matter of finding readers, it is all a matter of making friends and finding needs. What the book has given to us, and made of us, we can apply in general counselling, not recruiting. Maybe it is through such methods that, today, closet readers abound. Or do they?

We can endeavour to identify the spiritual interest of our friends and offer values. Hand them their independence. Fragmentation will continue. As individuals however, we will eventually seek an overriding ethic in society. One greater than our particular interest group.

The teachings, filtered through time and societies, are unlikely to be that moral imperative. It could be _The URANTIA Book_ per se — the revelation to the planet.

For structures tumble and no-one can be quarantined from change.

Behavioral theories and certain tics — neither stand the test of time. A cerebral world is replacing the mechanical.

But values, and our offspring, shall endure. As will our many categories of students continuing to study the blue ‘rule’ book, the one bastion that will retain its innocence. Reality will eventually catch up with it.

And perhaps this is the best way to provide for the diversity of readership through the course of this sagacious dispensation. Maintain, as long as possible, the innocence of _The URANTIA Book_. Allow for the spontaneity of discovery, and the personal and personality identification it ushers with great gusts of energy.

Spontaneity neither awaits or demands a formula of URANTIA Book introduction or readership style.

But the book itself, the gift of the gods, is imperative. But the book is on trial! And even worse than that, so are its contents! The rewriting is underway. An avalanche of half-truths, half-baked, half-inched. Choice, the modern god of consumerism.

What then of giving attention to the needs of the Unknown Reader, and less to our own. Perhaps their chosen status is its own reward. A perspective of enduring innocence, distributing values to family and friends.

So is _The URANTIA Book_ readership truly known and truly appreciated for its contribution to the advent of light and life? It would seem to be both undervalued and overvalued!!

## So They Say

**Lee Kuan Yew — On Good Government**

Whilst democracy and human rights are worthwhile ideas, we should be clear that the real objective is good government. That should be the test for official government aid. Is this a good government that deserves aid? Is it honest and effective? Does it look after its people? Is there an orderly stable society where people are being cducated and trained to lead a productive life?

**David Gelman — ‘Newsweek’ Magazine**

Ordinary people, many of them favored with sound intelligence and higher education, are recruited at a point in their lives when the summons to some larger collective purpose seems just the antidote to their alienation. Cult leaders know an outside threat increases the cohesion of the group. They foster a them-and-us mentality: members are the chosen ones, their mission transcendent. Many present themselves with special trunk lines to God.

**H. Mcqueen — ‘Weekend Australian’**

Perfect-fit adaptation and purposeful evolution are as anti-Darwinian as the creationism of the fundamentalist Christians. Darwin's good news is that human physiology works well enough to keep our species going, but some time in the near future — say in 250,000 years — homo sapiens will have evolved into something else or become extinct.

**Father James Murray — Anglican Priest**

Millennialism thrives in times of conflict and upheaval, but faces another problem. The year 2000 is confined to those countries and cultures following the Christian West. The Buddhist, Jewish, and Muslim calendars offer quite different years. In any case the Gregorian calendar is almost certainly skew-whiff by four or six or seven years, which makes 2000 inaccurate.

**Fred Hoyle — ‘The Intelligent Universe’ (M. Joseph, London, 1983)**

... the Earth is a fine garden which had its soil initially well-prepared to receive the seeds from which terrestrial life has evolved.

It is precisely because of...control by intelligence...that life on the Earth inherited such a comparatively placid and favourable home for its development.

I expect astronomers will eventually discover that much of what they currently believe concerning the behaviour and formation of galaxies has to be modified to take account of intelligent control.

## Letters To The Editor

### Articles Welcomed

_First Urantia Study Group, Auckland, New Zealand_

We really like the current editorship and format, as far as we're concerned you can be too tolerant of widely divergent views. We like articles to do with _The URANTIA Book_ and its teachings. Keep up the good work!

### Top Channel

_Francois Dupont, Bruxelles, Belgium_

I love Six-O-Six and I like its content. I especially appreciated your ideas about channelling, I fully share them!

All other channellings aside, are to be considered in function of (in relation to?) _The URANTIA Book_. Our inner conviction, guided by the Spirit of Truth, is the only individual tester and arbiter. Best wishes and compliments for your Six-O-Six newsletter.

## News Around The World

### Congress On Family Law And Human Rights

In July, the First World Congress on Family Law and Human Rights will be held in Sydney.

This congress sees the family as the vital human unit, and extends the definition of family beyond parents and children.

The contemporary assault on the family, and especially children, is due in part to the increasing coalescence of cultures and the denial of human rights.

The congress will consider The Economic and Social Council of the United Nations report that abuses of children including slavery, sale, and sexual exploitation, are universal.

### Anniversary Of Chinese Presbyterian Church

With its origins in the Australian goldrushes of the 1850s, the Chinese Presbyterian Church recently commemorated 100 years of ministry. The Church government has survived on an orthodoxy based on scriptures, faith, and integration into its community.

### New Journal Published

The ‘Salvington Circuit’ is a bi-monthly publication claiming to be part of the Continuing Fifth Epochal Revelation to awaken Cosmic and other Urantian reservists as to the adjudication by the Bright and Morning Star versus Lucifer which the publishers believe is being implemented now on Urantia by the present Planetary Prince, Machiventa Melchizedek and his staff.

### Australlans Are Religlous!

The Australian Bureau of Statistics reveals there are as many as eighty identifiable religious bodies now represented in this country.

## Understanding Unbelief

ABC's Radio National has begun a series — Understanding Unbelief. “It will seek to find a replacement for faith. Atheism has been a bit of a fizzer”, quotes the program organizer.

### International Fellowship Committee Report

_John Lange, International Fellowship_

The International Fellowship Committee made a trip to Mexico City, March 18-22, 1993. We were hosted by Javier de la Garza and his reader community. We made a presentation and had several group discussions. They are all excited about the Spanish translation to be published soon. Readers in Finland will be hosting ‘Summer Days’, June 11-13, 1993. This will probably be held in the Helsinki area. Joel Rehnstrom expressed to me the desire of the group to have many attendants from other countries. With the anticipated publication of the Finnish translation, this should be quite a joyous occasion.

The International 1993 Conference for readers of _The URANTIA Book_ is in the final planning stage. It will be held July 31 — August 5, 1993 in St. Hyacinthe near Montreal, Quebec, Canada. The theme is ‘Touch the World’, and we will focus on our international reader community. The opening ceremony will be a narrative of the Urantia movement in the world today. If you or someone you know has an interesting picture or story on this subject, please send it to me, or Sue Tenant.

As I have now visited several different cultures with URANTIA Book readers, I have found the Urantia Teachings not to replace but to be an outgrowth of more traditional religious beliefs. Thus the Urantia Teachings give us a fabric of common experience joining us in a family of great religious diversity.

### Big Bang — Big Fizz?

_Ken Crosswell, New Scientist_

Astronomers in the US and Britain believe they have discovered what may be the two most distant galaxy ‘superclusters’, vast chains of galaxies that stretch across tens of millions of light years. At 10 billion light years from earth, they would have existed just 2 billion years after the big bang. Their presence could completely destroy that theory which is already in trouble.

## Articles

### The Key To Loving Service

_Irene Bonutta, Melbourne_

With great interest I have been following the ongoing legal wrangles between the Urantia Foundation and Kristen Maaherra. As often happens in prolonged disputes, both sides are polarising, creating more division instead of coming any nearer to a solution.

What purpose does this whole situation serve? The gradual breakdown of the cohesion of the Urantia movement. This would seriously effect the beautiful truth this book proclaims. Religious experience is only valid as a living experience, a knowing of God as our Universal Father and a knowing of God in our divine self as in all our brothers and sisters. With this realisation, Jesus is our greatest inspiration of a God-conscious life, lived with total dedication and devotion in unbroken communion with the heavenly Father.

As we partake of his life as he lived it on earth, as we ponder his teachings and try to integrate them in our own lives, the closer we get to him.

By opening our hearts and listening to his words we see many present day situations in a new light.

> “_The new kingdom which my Father is about to set up in the hearts of his earth children is to be an everlasting dominion. There shall be no end of this rule of my Father in the hearts of those who desire to do his divine will. I declare to you that my Father is not the God of Jew or gentile. The power of this kingdom shall consist, not in the strength of armies nor in the might of riches, but rather in the glory of the divine spirit that shall come to teach the minds and rule the hearts of the reborn citizens of this heavenly kingdom, the sons of God. This is the brotherhood of love wherein righteousness reigns, and whose battle cry shall be: Peace on earth and good will to all men. This kingdom, which you are so soon to go forth proclaiming, is the desire of the good men of all ages, the hope of all the earth, and the fulfillment of the wise promises of all the prophets._” ([UB 140:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p1_2))

> “_Your message to the world shall be: Seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and in finding these, all other things essential to eternal survival shall be secured therewith. And now would I make it plain to you that this kingdom of my Father will not come with an outward show of power or with unseemly demonstration. You are not to go hence in the proclamation of the kingdom, saying ”it is here“ or ”it is there“, for this kingdom of which you preach is God within you._” ([UB 140:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p1_5))

It is the actual experience of the divine presence within our own being which makes us feel like apostles “proclaiming the good news”. This kind of experience can come in many ways: in a ditch by the roadside, in a family crisis or totally unexpected out of the blue. This baptism of the spirit has a mighty effect on most people. It can work out in many different ways.

We may turn to some existing religion, we may be inspired to write uplifting, helpful books, we may be a source of strength for the people around us.

There are many possibilities. All the good flowing from these activities are the fruits of the spirit which is beautiful and uniting. Sometimes it happens that people become so enthusiastic about what they have found and experience to work so well for them as individuals, that they think the whole world would change for the better if many more people would have this experience. When this proves not so easy to get across, it is the means and ways to achieve the aim that gets the attention.

> When we decide to co-operate with God, accept him in our lives, allow him to become part of our lives, we will find all type of assistance on our path fostering our spiritual growth.

When people feel very strongly about achieving their aim, unfortunately it sometimes happens that this kind of situation leads to downright fanaticism. Fanaticism, as is well known, can lead to violence. Over the ages and down to the present day we see the enormous costs in human suffering that this attitude has created. What started out as a beautiful experience has, after so much distortion, little left. Reading religious books, being revelations or not, will not in itself help us find God. It is the crying out, the longing for, that makes God reveal himself somewhere along the line. When we decide to co-operate with God, accept him in our lives, allow him to become part of our lives, we will find all type of assistance on our path fostering our spiritual growth. If we have created any problems in our lives we find the creative approach to solve them. We are all endowed with special talents that can be utilized in service and if we truly want to be apostles, our special line of work will gradually reveal itself. _The URANTIA Book_ is an astounding book but let's keep a balanced view on distribution and protection. Let us keep in mind what is truly at stake and that is: a demonstration of the living, dynamic religion which Jesus exemplified, by us as individuals.

> “_Salvation is the free gift of God, but those who are born of the spirit will immediately begin to show forth the fruits of the spirit in loving service to their fellow creatures. And the fruits of the divine spirit which are yielded in the lives of spirit-born and God-knowing mortals are: loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confiding trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace. If professed believers bear not these fruits of the divine spirit in their lives, they are dead; the Spirit of Truth is not in them; they are useless branches on the living vine, and they soon will be taken away. My Father requires of the children of faith that they bear much spirit fruit. If, therefore, you are not fruitful, he will dig about your roots and cut away your unfruitful branches. Increasingly, must you yield the fruits of the spirit as you progress heavenward in the kingdom of God. You may enter the kingdom as a child, but the Father requires that you grow up, by grace, to the full stature of spiritual adulthood. And when you go abroad to tell all nations the good news of this gospel, I will go before you, and my Spirit of Truth shall abide in your hearts. My peace I leave with you._” ([UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2))

### Responsibility

_Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

A review of a recent university study on ‘lying’ claimed to show that we all tell lies and about 93 percent of us tell at least one ‘whopper’ per week. I presume that all URANTIA Book readers make up part of the remaining 7 percent!

Why do human beings lie so much? I once heard a child psychologist explaining that our reward and punishment system for the training of our children is a marvelous way to teach children to lie. Harking back to my own childhood, I recall that if we chose to lie it had to be water-tight, since the consequences of being caught for lying were far worse than admitting to the felony. I recall too that my dear old mum could hand out a mean whipping for lying — for which I belatedly thank her. In those days the 9th commandment came over as, “It's a sin to tell a lie” — and there was even a popular song having that as both title and main theme. It must have been effective training, for almost 70 years later, I can still remember every deliberate lie I ever told. And that's no lie.

There are many kinds of liars in this world, some despicable like the ‘con artists’ who get their kicks from acts like cheating the feeble minded out of their life savings. Then there are those who seem to get away with it, such as politicians or the likeable rogue who is quick to confess with a cheery word and a mischievous grin when confronted with exposure.

There can be no doubt all forms of lying must hinder our spiritual progress but I wonder whether there is any form of lying that is as inhibitory to our progress' as that of lying to ourselves. This is the kind of lying we do when we bend the truth to bolster our self-esteem, or when we rationalize those selfish actions that bring hurt or harm to others. Most of us develop this kind of self-deceit into an art form such that virtually every act of our egoistic behaviour gets itself whitewashed, then polished shiny clean — and the blame for our defaults is squarely placed upon something or someone else.

Not so long ago, God was often thought of as a cantankerous, white- bearded old man who sat upon a heavenly throne doing little other than keeping score of our sins and misdeeds — and perhaps a few credits if we were very, very good.

On casual reading, _The URANTIA Book_ appears to have replaced that outmoded concept with one of a benign loving God whose spirit indwells our minds to conserve all those components of our thoughts and actions that have spiritual value. Only these are then utilised in the molding of a growing entity it calls our soul.

So what happened to the nasties?

Just this week, I was reading about tertiary seconaphim in _The URANTIA Book_, when I came across this comment:

> “_The Memory of Mercy discloses the moral debt of the children of mercy — their spiritual liabilities — to be set down against their assets of the saving provision established by the Sons of God._” ([UB 28:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_5))

That made me sit up and take notice. Then a little further on:

> “_The Memory of Mercy is a living trial balance, a current statement of your account with the supernatural forces of the realms. These are the living records of mercy ministration which are read into the testimony of the courts of Uversa when each individual's right to unending life comes up for adjudication, when thrones are cast up and the Ancients of Days are seated. The broadcasts of Uversa issue and come forth from before them; thousands upon thousands minister to them, and ten thousand times ten thousand stand before them. The judgment is set, and the books are opened._” ([UB 28:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_6))

That surely does not look as if I am going to have the slate wiped clean. Maybe I'll have to make some kind of restitution for those three lies I once told. (I guess that makes it four?) I found some confirmation:

> “_...justice demands the adjudication of every default in the climb towards divine perfection, mercy requires that every such misstep be adjudged in accordance with the creature nature and the divine purpose._” ([UB 39:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/39#p1_8))

In my student days, I once had a cynical professor who used to say that the purpose of life is to avoid death and the motivation for human behaviour is the avoidance of pain. The latter seems to be a fairly rational and logical explanation for our propensity to bury those self-seeking and self-gratifying components of the motivating forces for our actions underneath an overlay of self-justification — a feat that almost invariably results in complete self-exoneration. Such is the human condition. But when we hit the heavenly courts will we get away with it?

It seems not, for in describing those secondary seconophim called the Discerners of Spirits, a Universal Censor says:

> “_Regardless of the source or channel of information, no matter how meager the evidence at hand, when it is subjected to their reflective scrutiny, these discerners will forthwith inform us as to the true motive, the actual purpose, and the real nature of its origin. I marvel at the superb functioning of these angels, who so unerringly reflect the actual moral and spiritual character of any individual concerned in a focal exposure._” ([UB 28:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_19))

A little further on, he concludes:

> “_So it is with mortal man: The Mother Spirit of Salvington knows you fully, for the Holy Spirit on your world searches all things and whatsoever the divine Spirit knows of you is immediately available whenever the secoraphic discerners reflect with the spirit concerning the Spirit's knowledge of you._” ([UB 28:5.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_22))

In other words nothing, absolutely nothing at all, can be hidden.

Sometimes I wonder whether we mortals might not have been better off without _The URANTIA Book_. Surely we could not be held responsible for what we do not know. But I do have the book (so do you), I have read it many times, and there is so much I do know and so much I have understood (the same goes for you).

I know I will not get away with a plea of ignorance. That is quite out of the question. And I will be held responsible for those things I have tried to bury. Fortunately, I know that I will not exceed my mercy credits ([UB 28:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_8)), but I think I may be in for a big slice of penal servitude with hard labour. It will not surprise me to see some fellow URANTIA Book readers there in the chain gang with me. It will be nice to have your company.

I want to conclude these maudlin peregrinations of an introspecting mind with a conundrum. Is it possible to do the will of God on a part- time basis? For example, suppose that Job had scrupulously and religiously kept nine of the ten commandments for all of the time but felt that the seventh was not reasonable, so had the occasional Saturday night fling. Would he have been doing God's will for nine tenths of the time? Or would he have been doing his own will for all of the time? My conclusion would be that in selecting what he would or would not do, his own will is in total command. Actually _The URANTIA Book_ provides the answer for us.

> “_To isolate part of life and call it religion is to disintegrate life and to distort religion. And this is just why the God of worship claims all allegiance or none._” ([UB 102:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_1))

It's worth some thought, for there is nothing that can be hidden, nothing that will not be exposed. The worst of it is that our inherent inclination for self-exoneration tends to become habitual. Move over, Job!

### More On Caligastia

_Trevor Swadling, Sydney_

I would like to make a few observations concerning the current tendency for some readers of _The URANTIA Book_ to accuse or imply that some people are being influenced by Caligastia. Perhaps we may find some clues from _The URANTIA Book_ itself. A couple of characters who come to mind from _The URANTIA Book_ who one would expect to be candidates for being influenced by Caligastia, are Judas and some of the members of the Sanhedrin. What does the book say about them in relation to this? On UB 179:2.3 We read:

> “_He [Jesus] fully realised that this traitorous betrayal was the work of Judas, but it also pleased Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia._” [UB 179:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p2_3)

Then on UB 183:0.4:

> “_Though Jesus knew that the plan for his death had its origin in the councils of the rulers of the Jews, he was also aware that all such nefarious schemes had the full approval of Lucifer, Satan, and Caligastia._” [UB 183:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/183#p0_4)

Then on UB 66:8.6:

“_...neither Caligastia nor Daligastia was ever able to oppress mortals or coerce any normal individual into doing anything against the human will._” [UB 66:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/66#p8_6)

From these and other statements throughout the book we could assume that even well-intentioned but misguided thoughts, evil thoughts or even sinful thoughts at first originate in people's own human minds. It is the implementation of these thoughts into action that cause the problems. Once these kind of thoughts are put into train, Caligastia might use situations to his own ends, but we are not in a position to be absolutely sure, we just don't know. In so doing we may be giving Caligastia credit where credit is not due. Therefore under these circumstances I think it is wise to err on the side of caution rather than to suggest or accuse people of being under the direct influences of Caligastia. On UB 110:5.5, _The URANTIA Book_ warns us about adjuster guidance:

> “_But a human being would do better to err in rejecting an Adjuster's expression through believing it to be a purely human experience than to blunder into exalting a reaction of the mortal mind to the sphere of divine dignity._” [UB 110:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_5)

I think we should have the same attitude towards supposed influence by Caligastia on people. It would be safer in my view to look at it as people being led away by their own delusions, philosophic confusion or evil human propensities rather than suggesting they were under his direct evil influence. I am concerned at this tendency to suggest that others are being directly influenced by Caligastia. The main problem I have with this is that people may tend to use these arguments to point the finger at individuals whom they may not agree with or like, and use it against those who do not even think exactly the same as them. An attitude of blaming the devil is like harking back to the dark ages, not what did it but who did it. We may speculate on these things, but to come out and suggest or accuse people when we are not in a position to know beyond a doubt that they are directly under his influence would be totally un-Jesus-like and totally unproductive, and in many cases may be absolutely unjustified and hurtful to those to whom it may be implied.

The important and relevant thing for us to focus on in the case of Caligastia is to understand the causes, the repercussions, and the philosophy behind these so called liberated and false teachings — ‘The Doctrines of Lucifer’. In understanding the causes and effects of these teachings and seeing the confusion and disaster that resulted from them surely would put us in a better position now not to be attracted and deceived by them. Therefore an understanding, in hindsight, of Lucifer's downfall, and also a study of the downside and propensities of human nature would be helpful in combating these human tendencies that may lead us astray.

In looking at ‘The Doctrines of Lucifer’ one of the detestable things we come to notice in Lucifer's manifesto is that it seems to be akin and linked, quite deliberately packaged, to appeal to the natural and vulnerable tendencies of mankind such as: the easy way to do things, immediate results, the mixing of good and evil to reach a desired end more quickly, impatience, selfishness, self-assertion, pride, self-motivated liberty and denial of the laws of God and of God himself etc. No wonder it was so devastating on our young evolving planet and took hold so readily. To quote a small part of the second head of the manifesto, “_...if men and angels only had the courage to assert themselves and boldly claim their rights_”

We of today now stand amidst the shreds and lingering embers of Lucifer's dying document of “the sophistry of spurious personal liberty-rejection of universe allegiance and disregard of fraternal obligations, blindness to cosmic relationships”. The surest safeguard against Caligastia's Godless and ‘self philosophy’ and it's repercussions for us is presented on UB 34:7.6:

“_Jesus showed mankind the new way of moral living whereby human beings may very largely escape the dire consequences of the Caligastia rebellion and most effectively compensate for the deprivations resulting from the Adamic default. ‘The spirit of the life of Christ Jesus has made us free from the law of animal living and the temptations of evil and sin._’” [UB 34:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_6)

It is this we need to thirst for and build on, and in the process _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that one of the most important things we need to learn as humans is teamwork.

In conclusion, let's look at three cases in _The URANTIA Book_ that have a familiar thread. The first is Serapatatia and Eve; if only they had shared their thoughts and plans with others such as Adam they may have realised the consequences of their well-meant but wrong actions, and after discussing their ideas with others may have decided against it. When the authors look at the reasons for Judas' downfall, it was his unwillingness to confide in those closest to him, his harbouring of resentments which caused him not to share his life with those who really loved him, failing to share his feelings with those to whom he belonged. Even the Sanhedrin, if it was not for their puffed-up pride and feelings of importance, had they listened to Jesus and went out amongst the people with an attitude of trying to understand the truths he was proclaiming, they may have avoided the proud and wicked position they had decided upon. So let us pause for a moment — in remembrance of old John Zebedee as they carried him to church in a chair — he had his problems, and from time to time no doubt would have had a few clashes with his co-workers for the kingdom by God he would have seen a bit in his life — and what were the only words he spoke — “my little children, love one another!”

In my opinion our attitude towards Caligastia as a person should be one of non recognition, as the book implies — he's as good as finished and I believe it's just a matter of time.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### A Further Statistical Investigation Of Writing Styles In _The Urantia Book_

_Ken Glasziou, Maleny, Queensland_

A previous study on this subject was published in the March/April 1992 issue of Six-O-Six. The study was undertaken because of speculation that _The URANTIA Book_ may have been written by a single author. Some that have been suggested are: Dr. W. Sadler, Lena Sadler, Bill Sadler, Wilfred Kellogg, Carl Jung, H.G. Wells, and Robert Millikin.

Many forms of style analysis have been used in attempts to identify authors of various documents and literary works. The advent of computers has enabled investigators to use increasingly sophisticated methods to collect and analyze data. Much of the modern work has its roots in methods pioneered by Mosteller and associates. Included among these procedures is the fre. quency of use by individual authors of ‘marker’ words that begin sentences or join clauses and phrases within sen tences.

In the previous investigation, the frequency of use of marker words at the commencement of sentences was used in a broad-based investigation. For example, the first analysis simply compared Part 4 with the remainder of the book, it being expected that there could be differences in style between the authors for Part 4 (earthbound midwayers) and the authors of remainder of the book (celestial beings). A global test using six marker words indicated multiple authorship at a probability level of one part in more than 30,000 . The results of a survey indicated that there are not less than four authors of The URANTIA Papers, and perhaps nine or many more.

My collaborator in this work has been my son Paul, a medical graduate with a Ph.D. in maths and statistics, who suggested that it would be possible to apply these same techniques to compare writing styles for single authors who are named as the writers of multiple papers in the book. In this way, variability in the use of marker words in different papers by the same author would be taken into account when attempting to distinguish individual authors.

The papers selected for study were: Papers 11, 12, 13, and 14 by a Perfector of Wisdom; Papers 73,74,75, and 76 by Solonia; Papers 78,79,80, and 81 by an Archangel of Nebadon; Papers 82, 83, 84, 113, and 114 by the Chief of Seraphim on Urantia; and Papers 85,86,87,88, and 89 by a Brilliant Evening Star of Nebadon.

A number of marker words used to commence sentences were surveyed including ‘and’, ‘but’, ‘this’, ‘when’, ‘a’ or ‘an’, ‘it’, ‘as’, ‘many’, ‘by’, ‘thus’, ‘there’, ‘the’, ‘on’, ‘after’, ‘that’, and ‘neither’. The words ‘and’ and ‘the’ were chosen for the main survey on the grounds of highest frequency of use by all authors. The data for this survey are shown in Figure 1. A global likelihood ratio test in a logistical regression analysis showed that for the word ‘and’, the results indicated four or more authors at a probability level of .0003 . For the word ‘the’, three or more authors were indicated at a probability level of .0001 .

Individual comparisons were made for pairs of authors using pooled data for all the papers by each author and applying the Chi squared test for significance. The words ‘and’ and ‘the’ formed the basis of this analysis, but were supplemented by other marker words to further distinguish between authors. The results are shown in Table 1, and indicate the authors to be grouped together for the results shown in Figure 1, as well as drawing clear-cut distinctions between all of the nominated authors.

&nbsp; | Brilliant Evening Star | Solonia | Chief of Seraphim | Archangel of Nebadon |
--- | --- | --- | ---
Solonia | And, P = .025; The, P = .001<br>A or An, P = .001 | &nbsp; | &nbsp; | &nbsp;
Chief of Seraphim | And, P = .05; The, P = .001<br>But, P = .005; A or An, P = .001 | And, P = .001; The, P = .005<br>A or An, P = .025; But, P = .05 | &nbsp; | &nbsp;
Archangel of Nebadon | And, P = .025; The, P = .005<br>But, P = .001 | And, P = .001; The, P = .001<br>A or An, P = .005; But, P = .05 | And, P = .005; But, P = .025<br>This, P = .005 | &nbsp;
Perfector of Wisdom | And, P = .05; The, P = .005<br>But, P = .001; A or An, P = .001 | And, P = .001; A or An, P = .05<br>As, P = .025 | The, P = .005; But, P = .01<br>Many, P = .001

Table 1. The probabilities that pairs of authors of URANTIA Book Papers are different individuals as indicated by the frequency of sentences commencing with the marker words, “And” or “The” (see Figure 1.). When necessary, other marker words were used to obtain confirmatory evidence. All the authors are distinguishable from one another.

Together, these results indicate that each of the five sets of papers from _The URANTIA Book_ were written by five different individuals as nominated in the book itself.

### What Might Have Been?

_Tom Mulhall, Melbourne_

Jesus continued to teach the twenty four, saying:

> “_The heathen are not without excuse when they rage at us. Because their outlook is small and narrow, they are able to concentrate their energies enthusiastically. Their goal is near and more or less visible; wherefore do they strive with valiant and effective execution. You who have professed entrance into the kingdom of heaven are altogether too vacillating and indefinite in your teaching conduct. The heathen strike directly for their objectives; you are guilty of too much chronic yearning. If you desire to enter the kingdom, why do you not take it by spiritual assault even as the heathen take a city they lay siege to? You are hardly worthy of the kingdom when your service consists so largely in an attitude of regretting the past, whining over the present, and vainly hoping for the future. Why do the heathen rage? Because they know not the truth. Why do you languish in your futile yearning? Because you obey not the truth. Cease your useless yearning and go forth bravely doing that which concerns the establishment of the kingdom._” ([UB 155:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p1_3))

Although largely a matter of history now, _The URANTIA Book_ was published in 1955 by The Urantia Foundation in Chicago. Since that time over thirty major works by theologians, philosophers, psychologists and laypeople have appeared on our shelves related to the book. The Urantia movement, which grew principally from the book itself, has given rise to a bourgeoning Church, numerous centres for theology and philosophy around the globe, social reform programs too numerous to mention and has been called “...the only new religion this century to truly grasp the minds of modern peoples”.

_The URANTIA Book_ became a noticeable item carly in the 1960s. The outstanding feature of the book was its apparently effortless ability to inspire the minds of people from almost every walk of life and persuasion. What should have been on the surface, like so many other things of its kind, an obscure esoteric oddity, became readily appealing to business people, professionals, teachers, tradespeople as well as the rebellious youth of that age. The book seemed to have something for everyone and although conversation and dispute was much varied, and often hot, the ‘Revelation’ of _The URANTIA Book_ provided a framework that brought a new way of viewing the age-old Christian message and also a new way of seeing society's potential. It gave an enormous variety of people a unified goal which seemed to transcend social prejudices. By 1970 the term ‘Urantian’ was commonplace.

By the early 70s, the groundwork was being laid that would provide for the movement's continued growth and influence. Small churches were formed in many major cities around the world and the Christian churches began to take notice. Urantian centres of every kind provided the opportunity for people to meet and exchange ideas.

<img src="/image/article/606/sprinkler.jpg">
<figcaption>Maybe installing a sprinkler system wasn't such a good idea</figcaption>
</figure>

The book's great appeal was the modernity of its timeless spiritual message. People everywhere began to see the relevance of the age-old Christian message to a rapidly changing and technological environment.

With the healthy economic climate of the 70 s, social justice issues came to the fore and many notable politicians paid more than a fleeting interest to _The URANTIA Book_. In the business world, the concept of the ‘service motive’ overcoming the ‘profit motive’ took hold in the minds of many of the wealthy. Outreach work, often funded by major companies, began in the form of private Community Centres, Youth Centres, even Centres for Social Equality and Justice which sprang from the soil of the spiritual movement.

By the mid to late 70s it seemed that _The URANTIA Book_ was here to stay. Many people, disillusioned with mainstream Christianity, embraced the teachings while many Christians themselves, certainly at grass-roots level became more and more sympathetic with the message.

The early 1980s saw Urantian representatives at the United Nations, exerting a small but significant influence. The explosion really came in the 1980s when the new generation of young people began looking for a new and positive way to view society. The message of God's in. habited and structured universe took on new meaning for the young.

‘The Master Universe’ seemed to allay the fears and disillusionments of a world becoming increasingly smaller and the more easily controlled by man's incompetency. Many rock musicians sang of Urantian issues and when the ‘Live-Aid’ phenomenon swept the world, the concentric circles banner was among many others on the stages.

That the book exerted a completely unexpected influence on the young of the 80s is perhaps not so surprising considering the enormous capacity for idealism among the young of any age. _The URANTIA Book_ became the catalyst to inspire and maintain that idealism. What could have ended as a decade of increasing despair, most notably as a return to more drugs and loud, discordant music, rose more noticeably on new wings.

War, prejudice, and poverty still claim the lives of thousands of people today. But the 20th century has also given rise to a new, bold, and remarkably appropriate spiritual message. Urantians of the 90 s continue to provide benevolent social facilities of many kinds. That the book has influenced the personal spiritual lives of thousands is without question.

As one reader said: “_The URANTIA Book_ is a modern book for modern people. It belongs to all the peoples of the world. There was always the danger of the Movement becoming a self-contained esoteric sect. Any individual would be foolish to imagine he or she has authority over its teachings. The common people heard Jesus' message gladly, and still today, nothing else has such relevance and meaning”.

What does the future hold? Publishers of _The URANTIA Book_, now in seven translations, claim: “The book itself seems to accomplish everything that justifies its authorship. We were always in the very fortunate position to give God's latest message to the world a chance to work”.

> Always a unifying influence, perhaps its [the UB's] future is as inevitable and secure as its simple and age-old message: “Love your neighbour as yourself”.

Perhaps the future will see continued and greater sympathybetween the Movement and the Christian churches. Always a unifying influence, perhaps its future is as inevitable and secure as its simple and age-old message: “Love your neighbour as yourself”. What has been received from ‘on high’, Urantians have never been slow to freely give to their fellow man:

> “_He loved men as brothers, at the same time recognizing how they differed in innate endowments and acquired qualities. He went about doing good. Jesus was an unusually cheerful person, but he was not a blind and unreasoning optimist. His constant word of exhortation was, “Be of good cheer”. He could maintain this confident attitude because of his unswerving trust in God and his unshakable confidence in man. He was always touchingly considerate of all men because he loved them and believed in them. Still he was always true to his convictions and magnificently firm in his devotion to the doing of his Father's will._” ([UB 100:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_8))

## On Reflection

### The Lord is My Pacesetter...

_Oswald Astor_

The Lord is my pacesetter. I shall not rush.
He makes me stop and rest for quiet intervals.
He provides me with images of stillness which 
restore my serenity.
He leads me in ways of efficiency through 
calmness of mind.
His guidance is peace.
Even though I have a great many things to 
accomplish each day, I will not fret.
For His presence is here, His timelessness, His all 
importance will keep me in balance.
He prepares refreshment and renewal in the midst 
of my activity by anointing my mind with the oils 
of tranquility.
My cup of joyous energy overflows.
Such harmony and effectiveness shall be the fruits 
of my hours.
For I shall walk in the peace of the Lord and t
dwell in His House forever.

### From ‘New Age Understanding’

_Donald Curtis (Unity Books, Missouri, USA)_

What is grace? Grace has been defined as the impersonal outpouring of God's love into His creation. If we truly felt that God lives in our heart, if we truly believed that God is our very being and that we live because God lives through us, then we would never feel any separation whatsoever. We would become what we are intended to be — vehicles for the infusion of God's grace into the world.

Problems come because we do not seek the kingdom first. We seek accomplishment first. Let us be very honest with ourselves and look at the way in which we approach this business of living. Don't we usually approach it first from the human point of view? You say: “Well, of course I do! I'm human. How else would I approach it?” Quite right, but there is another way of looking at ourselves. Although we are going through a human experience, we are not human beings. We are spiritual beings. We are sons of God going through a human experience. We must understand that we are not primarily sons of men; we are sons of God. So long as we believe that we are only human beings, we are going to experience pain, suffering, tears, disease, and death. But when we realize that the human aspect is but an expression of the divine reality, then a great new standard of living becomes operative. It becomes possible to walk this earth, through grace, as sons of God.

The spiritual way of life does not interest everybody. It is only when a person comes to see that we are here in life for a purpose, and that this purpose is to unfold, to grow, to learn, to develop, to live, walk, speak, think, and act as what we are — sons of God — that we really become interested in spiritual standards. When we surrender our human and worldly appetites, we do not give up anything; rather we attain something. But we do not do this just in order to attain. We do it because we know that this is the Way, the Truth, and the Life.

As we give up all destructive, negative ties such as fears, worries, tensions, pressures, selfishness, and self-seeking, and live by grace instead of by effort, we will be free.

Only God is good. The good that comes forth from an individual comes from the spiritual self, the God-self. Man hasn't even begun to express the tremendous potential that lies beneath the surface. We need to learn one principle: As we give up all destructive, negative ties such as fears, worries, tensions, pressures, selfishness, and self-seeking, and live by grace instead of by effort, we will be free.

I had an awakening not too long ago. There is something that I had been wanting very, very much. I expressed this great desire in prayer — and listened for the answer. The ‘inner voice’ came through loud and clear. It said, “You must give up this desire, because any desire you have limits your potential for progress”.

I have been meditating upon this instruction ever since, and it has come to me that any time we intrude our personal wants and desires, or even our objectives and goals between ourselves and the full attainment of what God has in mind for us, we introduce limits that separate us from the God-within. We gain our true goal only by surrender, by bringing our gift to the altar and saying: “Father, you gave me this life, now I am giving it back to you. I am reporting for duty. I am emptying myself of these things which have put me in bondage. Use me ”.
