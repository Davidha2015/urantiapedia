## Editor's Notebook

One of more outstanding features of _The URANTIA Book_ is its unfailing recognition of the individual. Not socially conferred rights, bestowed identity and purpose, for they must be earned.

Our problem is: Do others recognize and appreciate what we try to make of ourselves? Outside of God and close associates we are virtually unknown in life's passing parade.

Educational systems (as distinct from some special schools), however, are showing signs of recognizing personal values.

Teachers are becoming part of a collaborative parenthood aiming at the whole of life. No longer is problem solving and teamwork seen in the narrow focus of commercial productivity and success.

It is almost reminiscent of the tribe of Canadian Indians whose ‘competencies’ included compassion, courage, humility, anger at injustice, guilelessness, even a capacity to be alone.

We are also seeing a desire for change in basic corporate cultures. Corporate health, once evaluated in terms of ability to create wealth, now recognizes its dependence on human capital.

As yet, businesses are not able to bring this asset to account. New definitions, beyond intellectual property, are required.

The worth of employees, customers, and competitors are best measured in the value of relationships. That is “when two or more are gathered in my name”.

Managers and teachers will need to encourage their charges to become individuals with a strong sense of belonging to a caring community. To do so, the leaders need to embody spiritual values where dreams are partners with reality.

An example of impending change is the International Baccalaureate Organization (IBO), a non-government organization holding consultative status with UNESCO, and based in Geneva, Switzerland.

Founded in 1970 , it offers a two year pre-university course in 450 schools in 65 countries.

Students, in addition to the usual disciplines of language, science and mathematics, conduct personal research and participate in creative, aesthetic, athletic, and community service type activities.

The Theory of Knowledge element provides a philosophical approach to knowledge and its acquisition.

IBO believe they educate the whole person. But in all its attention to personal development, it totally ignores the spiritual nature of the individual.

> “_The spiritual renaissance must await the coming of these new teachers..._” ([UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4))

‘Success’ then is coming to have a whole new meaning. That which contributes to eternal survival, both within oneself and within relationships, is perhaps a measure. When seen in this enlightened context, even apparent failures may in fact prove to be our greatest triumphs. The life of Jesus Christ attests to that.

Purpose, as envisioned and given by the revelators, needs to be offered to our colleagues and students.

In the journey to God, free-will creatures will engage in an almost limitless number of relationships. But in each of them it will be the individual's relationship with God that is paramount.

Only there are our true natures and achievements recorded, and perhaps somewhat admonishingly, reported back to us.

## So They Say

**David Tracey (Lecturer In Humanities)**

New Age writings do not lend themselves to critical assessment. The reader is turned into a believer and if you don't believe you are out. Sheer assertiveness wipes out the middle ground, where the intelligent reader can reflect and make independent judgments.

**From ‘Infinite In All Directions’ by Freeman Dyson**

I believe that we are here to some purpose, that the purpose has something to do with the future, and that it transcends altogether the limits of our present knowledge and understanding....If you like, you can call the transcendent purpose...God...inherent in the universe and growing in power and knowledge as the universe unfolds. Our minds are not only expressions of its purpose but are also contributions to its growth.

**Newsweek Magazine**

Many (U.S.) Companies have sub-contracted lowwage manufacturing work in China. They risk being unwitting parties to human rights abuses. Amnesty International cites plenty of examples of Chinese who have been persecuted in the work place. The U.S. hopes to advance human rights by legislating a code of conduct for American businesses overseas that would require companies to protect workers against political persecution.

**The Australian Magazine**

The man most likely to succeed the ailing John Paul II could overturn his teaching on birth control, begin recruiting women priests, and end the nine hundred year tradition on priestly celibacy.

Whatever path he chooses, Carlo Maria Martini, Cardinal Archbishop of Milan, risks sparking a crisis that could prove terminal for a divided Catholic Church.

**Phillip Adams, Columnist**

I can't think of an organization that I respect half as much as Amnesty International. I'm lost in admiration for the courage of those who gather the information, frequently at risk of their lives. You can't help but admire the even-handed way it has approached governments and regimes, indifferent to their ideological, religious or cultural differences.

Amnesty takes the view that there is a universal standard of human rights that must be applied, and that anything less than that is intolerable. “Recognition of the inherent dignity and of the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice and peace in the world.” That's the Amnesty line, and it won't allow equivocation or compromise.

## Letters To The Editor

### Six-O-Six Too Slow!!

_Allan Lane, Perth. W.A._

Thank you for the references from The URANTIA $B o o k .$. By the way, I have a serious complaint to make about Six-O-Six: I read it all the day it arrives and then have to wait another two months before the next one arrives!! Ken Glasziou's article ‘Responsibility’ was most sobering and worthwhile contemplating.

### U.S. Distribution Of Six-O-Six

_David Glass, Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.A._

I like to find new and long-term subscribers receiving the newsletter because, as an international forum, it affords an extra-American look at the URANTIA Community (as I prefer to say, instead of ‘URANTIA Movement’ — I don't think we are quite moving yet). Best wishes for your continuing efforts for sharing truth through the publication and in various ways besides.

### Where I Put My Trust

_Robert Martin, Sydney_

Concerning the matter of Sedona, I have been sent an unsolicited copy of The Salvington Circuit, Vol.1, No.1. Upon consideration, I have decided to remain aloof from what they are doing. Quite frankly, I feel that I should not aid or abet them in any way whatsoever. I put my trust in the URANTIA Foundation, the United Nations, UNESCO, the World Health Organization and other similar bodies, and not in UFO's or channellers.

## News Around The World

### What Is Happiness?

Aristotle said happiness was the reward of an active life lived with sweet reason. Freud said it was mostly a matter of work and love. Charles Schulz, the cartoonist philosopher, claimed it was really a warm puppy. being'.

Psychologists sometimes refer to it as 'subjective well-

So what is happiness?

Studies show it primarily depends — not on youth, success, wealth — but on close relationships, followed by happy marriages. Next comes religious faith.

### Pragmatism!

After decades of dominating Australian universities, the arts are rapidly losing out to more pragmatic programs.

Between 1988 and 1992, students taking legal studies rocketed by 62%, enrolments in business and commerce increased by 45%, and science intakes went up by 44%.

The arts, humanities, and social sciences managed to attract slightly less than 25%.

In the past, the humanities faculties have nurtured most of Australia's intelligentsia — the writers, the poets, philosophers and public servants. With the current political emphasis on economic outcomes, there is the concern that the cultural role of higher education has been devalued.

And the future? The Government has recommended that priority areas of computer science, Asian studies, and business courses get 60% of new student places created between 1989 and 1993 . Only 11% would go to the arts, humanities, and social sciences.

### Nascent Planets?

_Ben Sandilands in ‘The Bulletin’_

At Narrabri, in Western New South Wales, the Australian telescope has radio-imaged what appear to be whole solar systems of planets being born around new stars.

At the Mount Stromlo Observatory, Canberra, an optical telescope is finding initial signs that mysterious objects are causing the background stars of a neighbouring galaxy to blink.

Both discoveries are potential breakthroughs in our understanding of the universe.

North of Perth there are plans to build a gravitational observatory as part of a global network of four detectors to pick up ripples in the fabric of space. These ripples have been predicted but not yet observed.
Another major project is scheduled for the Antarctic ice cap. An infrared telescope there will offer more detailed viewing conditions at lower cost than a space or moon based observatory.

### Urantia Book Display

URANTIA Foundation displayed _The URANTIA Book_ at the Australian Book Fair in June 1993 at the Darling Harbour Exhibition Centre in Sydney.

### Study Group Directory

ANZURA, the Australian and New Zealand United Readers Association, has compiled a study group directory.

A copy of this directory is enclosed with this issue of Six-O-Six. The ANZURA Bulletin makes the comment: “Hopefully we will see the pages of our directory expand over the years”.

### Translations, Concordance, And Eleventh Printing Of _The Urantia Book_ Now available.

In early June, the Spanish and Finnish translations, a Finnish index, an English Concordance, and the eleventh printing of _The URANTIA Book_ in English were delivered to the URANTIA Foundation. This constitutes the largest printing ever of _The URANTIA Book_.

3,000 copies of the first printing of the Finnish translation, 5,000 copies of the first printing of the Spanish translation, 25,000 copies of the eleventh printing of the English version of _The URANTIA Book_, 3,000 copies of the first printing of a Finnish index, and 3,000 copies of an exhaustive English concordance. The arithmetic tells the story — we are about to begin the dissemination of 39,000 books.

The Spanish translation, El Libro de URANTIA, will be available for a suggested retail price of US \$55. El Libro de URANTIA, like the English version, will be sold through bookstores.

## Articles

### On Group Conformity

_Sunshine Coast Study Group_

Many events in this century have sounded ominous warning of the inherent dangers confronting individuals when subjected to pressures arising within social groups. Examples are: the excesses that derived from the Nietzschian master race paradigm thrust upon the German people by their Nazi leaders; the kamikaze behaviour of Japanese troops and airmen; the irrational succumbing by youth to peer group pressures in respect of potentially harmful habits (smoking, drug taking), or the idea that virginity status is shameful which may lead to a consequent exposure of immature minds and bodies to the hazards of pregnancy, AIDS, and venereal diseases. More spectacularly, there have been the bizarre outcomes attached to religious ministries such as that of the Reverend Jones whose flock committed mass suicide by taking cyanide, or the recent holocaust resulting from the Waco affair.

#### Inherent Nature Of Groups

Of course, not all group behaviour has such dramatic effects and obviously there are benefits to be gained from belonging to a group. In fact, for we humans, our very survival is dependent on our participation in various groups, be it family, tribe, race, nation, etc. But what we need to be aware of is that our participation in any group may bring about behaviour patterns in individuals that they would certainly reject in the absence of group pressures.

Groups are a fundamental component of our social life. For most of our lives we are surrounded by groups and much of our life activity is spent in trying to get into groups, participating in groups, or trying to get out of groups — so much so that we become accustomed to them and their effects upon our behaviour as individuals goes unnoticed. Because the understanding of group behaviour patterns is of such importance for our welfare, the study of intragroup conduct has received much attention in social psychology with the result that facets of behaviour such as cohesiveness, conformity, leadership, compliance to authority figures, and polarization have been extensively studied.

A group can achieve much more than the sum of the efforts of its individual members. _The URANTIA Book_ states:

> “_A social group of human beings in co-ordinated working harmony stands for a force far greater than the simple sum of its parts._” ([UB 133:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p5_6))

That is the good news about groups. The bad news is that groups usually extract a price for membership that may include suppression of individual contribution, conformity, brainwashing, unthinking obedience to the majority, complete domination by a leader, etc.

#### Group Influences

The urge to conform, to be seen not to be different from other group members, is a very strong urge. Studies by social psychologists that pull strangers together for a brief period (minimal paradigm studies) have clearly shown an intrinsic need of us mortals to identify with a group. The very fact that four or five people are merely placed in the same room for the purpose of undertaking the same task will cause them to swiftly categorize themselves as group members. Consider then how strong this tendency must be when we actively seek group membership!

> It Is Always Incumbent Upon Us To Seek To Do The Father's Will, Rather Than acquiesce to the group will.

Hundreds of conformity studies using a variety of methods indicate that individuals often knowingly conform to the incorrect opinions of a majority. Some members simply comply, not wanting to appear out of step with the others in the group, or to appear stupid. Others change their opinion in the belief that the majority (or a strong leader) must be right.

Obedience to authority or to a conceived leader is such an enormously powerful tendency in us humans that it is essential to recognize it and to consider it objectively if we are to make correct decisions. Just how powerful this need to be led or to be told what to do is was illustrated by the hitherto inconceivable mass changing of sides that occurred with U.N. troops taken prisoner during the Korean war. The technique used against the prisoners was pathetically simple, and had nothing to do with an arduous and continuous brainwashing. In fact, the change was effected by merely observing the group behaviour of prisoners and removing to another camp, all those individuals who showed any signs of leadership. To collapse the morale of the rest and render them highly susceptible to indoctrination, less than 5% of prisoners were removed. But let's not be too quick in convincing ourselves about our own superiority. Hear what a seraphim (Guardian of Destiny) said of her human charge (who must have attained at least third circle status):

> “_Much of my difficulty was due to the unending conflict between the two natures of my subject: the urge of ambition opposed by animal indolence; the ideals of a superior people crossed by the instincts of an inferior race; the high purposes of a great mind antagonized by the urge of a primitive inheritance._” ([UB 111:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p7_5))

#### Studies Conducted

The all-too-human tendency to accept leadership and obey authority was demonstrated in a classic analysis of obedience by Milgram (1974) who instructed group members to give apparently painful and potentially deadly electric shocks to other members. He found that 65% of his subjects obeyed because they felt powerless to refuse the orders of the authority. Milgram considered that grotesque instances of obedience to malevolent authority, such as the Nazi campaign to exterminate the Jews and the Jonestown suicides and killings of children, to be instances of the same processes that he observed in his experimental work — those who obeyed orders had reached an ‘agentic’ state and no longer accepted responsibility for their own destiny. They were simply ‘agents’ of their leaders. In the Jonestown case, the Reverend Jones had emphasized loyalty and self-discipline and extolled the virtues of death in a noble cause. Eventually when he called for the ‘ultimate sacrifice’ his followers could only obey.

A second well-known classic study on aggression, obedience, and the power of roles on group behaviour is that of Zimbarbo et al (1972). A group of college students, selected for emotional stability, participated in a realistic prisoners and guards role-playing simulation. The study was designed to last for two weeks, but it had to be abandoned after six days during which the prisoners became servile, dehumanized people who thought only of escape and their mounting hatred of the guards. Guards abused the power that had been given them and became aggressive toward the prisoners.

The frightening thing about these findings is that the participants were normal, well-balanced people. The lesson to be learned is that when we humans put on our group hat, drastic behavioural changes can occur. Thus a URANTIA Book reader who achieves some ‘official’ status ranging from a Foundation Trustee or member of the F.E.F. Executive to a leader or convener of a study group will, almost inevitably, behave quite differently in the group environment. It is always incumbent upon us to seek to do the Father's will, rather than acquiesce to the group will.

These changes in behaviour are likely to be related to the expectations of the individual joining a group. Mostly, we humans join groups in anticipation of some advantage accruing to ourselves, be it approval from our peers or even from God. So when we don the group hat, we are more likely to conform to the group mores rather than risk jeopardizing our group membership.

#### Urantia Book References

In such situations, even a sincere URANTIA Book reader who is genuinely seeking to conform to God's will may unconsciously bend what they conceive to be God's will to make it align with the group will. The cure is to follow the instructions of the book:

> “_To ‘follow Jesus’ means to personally share his religious faith and to enter into the spirit of the master's life of unselfish service for man. One of the most important things in human living is to find out what Jesus believed, to discover his ideals, and to strive for the achievement of his exalted life purpose._” ([UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3))

Having taken on “the mind of Jesus” ([UB 47:3.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p3_3)), it becomes possible to do what you would expect Jesus to have done in similar circumstances.

Referring to the leadership of Jesus, _The URANTIA Book_ states:

> “_Only three men who received his personal call refused to accept the invitation to discipleship. He exercised his personal drawing power over men, but he was not dictatorial. He commanded confidence, and no man ever resented his giving a command. He assumed absolute authority over his disciples, but no one ever objected. He permitted his followers to call him Master._” ([UB 149:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_12))

But the critical difference was that:

> “_Jesus received the obedience of his followers without exacting it._” ([UB 149:2.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p2_12))

Awareness of our inherent weaknesses is an imperative if we are to at least partially fulfil the plan and the leading of our Thought Adjusters during our mortal life. A Solitary Messenger informs us:

> “_The Urantia races are so largely electrically and chemically controlled, so highly animal-like in their common behavior, so emotional in their ordinary reactions, that it becomes exceedingly difficult for the Monitors to guide and direct them. You are so devoid of courageous decisions and consecrated co-operation that your indwelling Adjusters find it next to impossible to communicate directly with the human mind. Even when they do find it possible to flash a gleam of new truth to the evolving mortal soul, this spiritual revelation often so blinds the creature as to precipitate a convulsion of fanaticism or to initiate some other intellectual upheaval which results disastrously. Many a new religion and strange ”ism“ has arisen from the aborted, imperfect, misunderstood, and garbled communications of the Thought Adjusters._” ([UB 110:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p4_5))

Besides drawing attention to our genetic deficiencies resulting from the Adamic default, this passage informs us that, at our present state of development, it is next to impossible for our Thought Adjusters to communicate with our human minds!

#### Claims About Channelling

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that “_only the Thought Adjuster directly contacts the human mind_”. ([UB 34:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p5_3)) That should surely sound a warning to all URANTIA Book readers when considering the claims associated with group activities involving channelling. Literature from the ‘Teaching Mission’ that originated at Woods Cross, Utah, states that contact with celestial ‘teachers’ must be requested through our Thought Adjusters and subsequent communication must come via the Thought Adjuster with the aid of a Midwayer. How likely is this if it is next to impossible for our Thought Adjusters to communicate with our minds?

Recently the ‘Teaching Mission’ has expanded its horizons beyond just URANTIA Book readers. Now it is to all nations, races, and religions. It has also been stated that everybody who so desires may have their own celestial teacher. But since a teacher must contact the human mind through the Thought Adjuster with the aid of a secondary midwayer ([UB 114:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_9)), and since the number of secondary midwayers remaining on Urantia after the rebellion was 1,111 , will there not be a logistics problem? With the world population at something in the order of 4-5 billion, there can only be one secondary midwayer to every 4-5 million of us! Draw your own conclusions.

We must always remember that our gullibility tends to be amplified in a group situation and when we are already in a state of mind of wanting a supernatural experience before joining a group, our critical facilities will be severely hampered. Evidence has already been cited that this is the way we humans are, and not just a minority, it is so for virtually all of us!

In the May 1992 edition of Six-O-Six, Meredith Sprunger drew attention to errors by ‘Teacher Ham’ regarding the spiritual centre of the planet and the role of Norson. In transcripts we have from a ‘Teacher Bertrand’ session, a participant notices that Bertrand travels from the spiritual centre to his group “virtually instantaneously” whereas it takes Ham about an hour. When attention is drawn to the anomaly, no explanation is offered, and the matter is dropped. A question to Bertrand regarding the Healing Mission asks, “How come everybody dies that gets worked on?” A promise is made to contact Ham on this subject and, after repeated requests, Ham does put in a brief appearance, gives a message of encouragement, makes no mention of the Healing Mission, and departs unceremoniously giving no opportunity for questions. Subsequently Ham departed the planet, and the matter is allowed to lapse.

Here is a transcript from a session with celestial Teacher Bertrand channelled to a Transmitter/Receiver named ‘James’.

Student: Bertrand, have any of the teachers in this Teaching Mission fused with their Thought Adjusters yet?

Bertrand: One moment. [Pause.] No. We are all pre-fusion candidates.

Student: Even Ham?

Bertrand: Yes.

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia" alt="before">
<img src="/image/article/606/before.jpg">
</figure>

Student: Ham was a gardener on Edentia and he still hasn't fused?

Bertrand: No.

No further discussion of this anomaly occurs. From _The URANTIA Book_ we can glean that pre-fusion candidates are normally located on the mansion worlds. Although visits may be possible, there is no indication that candidates actually work outside the local system. Jerusem is the capital of our local system. Edentia is the capital of the constellation of Norlatiadek! We go there after fusion and after graduation from the local system. There, “The celestial artisans direct the native spornagia in this extensive work of botanic decoration and biologic embellishment”. (492) There is no indication that prefusion morontia beings from local systems are employed as gardeners in this work.

Currently in Australia, we are being assailed by two competing channelling groups, one hailing from Sedona, Arizona, the other originating in Woods Cross, Utah. The Sedona group provides us with an exhortation to obedience from their version of Machiventa Melchizedek, along with a veiled threat that we will see a different side of God if we do not comply. Also a warning is issued denigrating the Woods Cross Teaching Mission. From the Teaching Mission, Teacher Bertrand is asked: “In Sedona there is a person who claims that they are [sic] a transmitter-receiver for Gabriel. Are these instances authentic and is there some kind of co-ordination by Ham?” Bertrand responds: “Yes indeed they are co-ordinated... At this time, Gabriel is not transmitting through any individual on this planet”. Each centre has its own version of Machiventa Melchizedek.

It is not our function to make judgements on any of this channelled material. Our purpose is to draw the attention of URANTIA Book readers to the vast amount of investigative work that has been done on group dynamics with the finding that we unfortunate Urantians have very faulty critical facilities in group situations, as well as a tendency to be drained of individuality and willpower. However Jesus said: “When did I teach you that you must all see alike...what I require is spiritual unity”. (1591) Many roads lead to God and each must choose their own.

Although the channelling pathway is not likely to prevent us attaining God, if we choose this path, one reader has expressed this opinion: “Even if channelling is a true spiritual communication then what do I have to lose by not believing it? The other side of the coin is that if channelling is not true and I believe in it, the loss will be greater than the gain”.

In the paper referred to by Meredith Sprunger, we read: "One wonders why people feel a need for channelling guidance which, historically, does not have a very good track record, when they have direct personal contact with much higher sources of truth: their Thought Adjuster, the Spirit of Truth, and the Holy Spirit".

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia" alt="now">
<img src="/image/article/606/now.jpg">
</figure>


#### Spirit Influences

Whereas it is true that we Urantians have great difficulty in communicating directly with our Thought Adjusters, nevertheless we can find evidence in our own lives and in the lives of others that our Thought Adjusters are really effective. Jesus once said “Only God is good”, and the book confirms that all evidence for the existence of personal attributes reflecting that which is holy, just, great, true, beautiful or good provide confirmation of the working of our Thought Adjusters. This must be so since all contact of human minds with the spiritual world is via our Thought Adjuster and all these attributes have their origin in God. So every one of our ‘good’ thoughts and our ‘good’ deeds tells us our Thought Adjuster is on the job despite poor direct communication.

Since Pentecost, another great spiritual influence has operated in the lives of all Urantians who seek his presence — the Spirit of Truth, the gift of the resurrected Jesus. The remarkable effectiveness of the Spirit of Truth is indicated by these words:

> “_In less than a month after the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth, the apostles made more individual progress than during their almost four years of personal loving association with the Master._” ([UB 194:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_9))

We can know when the Spirit of Truth is being effective in our own lives because:

> “_The spirit never creates a consciousness of himself, only a consciousness of Michael, the Son._” ([UB 194:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_4))

Consciousness of Jesus comes about through prayer and through familiarity with his life and teachings. Many of us find that our consciousness of Jesus is proportional to that familiarity, and when we have that, we can always ask ourselves the question in any situation: “What would Jesus have done?”

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that the secret of survival is in the supreme human desire to be Godlike, the willingness to do all things essential to the attainment of that desire. The success of our Adjuster depends very much upon our decisions, determinations, and steadfast faith. The importance of our own personal decisions is emphasized many times. Mostly these will be made independently of group interaction, they will be made with the aid of our spirit resources to guide us on what is really right, not merely what we think is right — and the spiritual value resident in all such decisions will be our everlasting possession.

#### Group Interaction

Group interaction can be of tremendous personal and community benefit when we learn to avoid the negative effects of what we know as peer group pressure, the pressure we feel to conform for the sake of approval, regardless of the threat of accompanying error or evil. The benefits of good group activity is both obvious and essential for the material and spiritual progress of society. Possibly the most uplifting and valuable of all group activities is to be found in group worship. As with other human activities, we need to be discerning.

Would it not be marvellous if we could call upon a paradise ‘conductor of worship’ to really teach us about group worship?

#### The Ultimate Destiny And Purpose Of Group Activity

Who can fail to be thrilled by these words:

> “_Worship is the highest privilege and the first duty of all created intelligences. Worship is the conscious and joyous act of recognizing and acknowledging the truth and fact of the intimate and personal relationships of the Creators with their creatures._” ([UB 27:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_1))

And:

> “_Sometimes all Paradise becomes engulfed in the dominating tide of spiritual and worshipful expression. Often the conductors of worship cannot control such phenomena until the appearance of the threefold fluctuation of the light of the Deity abode, signifying that the divine heart of the Gods has been fully and completely satisfied by the sincere worship of the residents of Paradise, the perfect citizens of glory and the ascendant citizens of time._” ([UB 27:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_7))

One day in the far-distant future, such an occasion of group worship will mark our qualification for admission to the Corps of Finality. Thanks be to God that there are no mistakes that we can make that will prevent that day eventuating if that is our genuine desire.

## The Book Study \& Discussion

### Faith And The Channelling Pathway

_Ken Glasziou, Queensland_

Firstly let me state that I am writing about my pathway — nobody else's. Jesus said: “_When did I teach you that you must all see alike... what I require of you is spiritual unity_”. ([UB 141:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/141#p5_1)) So I am not about to claim that the ‘teaching mission’, channelling, or any other phenomenon is false. What I really want to say is that even if any such pathway could be shown to be valid, I would still not want to take it. A good reason was given in an earlier Six-O-Six article by Meredith Sprunger who questioned why people would feel a need for channelling guidance when they already have direct personal contact with much higher sources of truth: their Thought Adjuster, the Spirit of Truth, and the Holy Spirit.

When considering this matter, it seemed to me that I would have to go right back to basics and first ask myself why God created us mortals at all! Why are we subjected to this strange, initial introduction to our universe careers in an often hostile environment on a material planet? After all, _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that our final goal is to stand as a perfected spirit-being in the presence of the Universal Father. The book also tells us that: “_the mistakes which you fail to forget in time will be forgotten in eternity_”. ([UB 156:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_8)) So why do we have to go through this material experience? Why doesn't our universe career commence in some much more advanced environment even Havona maybe?

Let us try to review our facts. We humans come into this inhospitable world as helpless and totally dependent babes, with minds not all that much more advanced than some of the other animals on Urantia, and with seemingly inferior bodies that appear to be inordinately unsuitable for successful competition in a survival-of-the-fittest kind of environment. Excepting for certain kinds of instinctive knowledge essential to our early survival, at birth our memory banks are completely blank. If we are very lucky, we might be born into a loving and secure family environment where our empty minds would be carefully nurtured and outfitted with a set of values having true spiritual worth. However, this is not so for most of us. Ideally, the values presented to us by the society in which we mature to adulthood should strike a reasonable compromise between our legitimate self-interests and those interests that impinge upon the well-being of that society. But for the majority of Urantia natives reality is to either compete or perish. And so life tends to degenerate into a survival conflict.

Why did our Creator want us to endure this extraordinary state? What alternatives were open to Him to achieve whatever end He has in mind for us? If we question our fellow human beings about the meaning of human life, we will be presented with an incredible set of possibilities ranging from the concept that the whole shemozzle is a meaningless, absurd and pitiless joke, to an equally meaningless one whereby our selfhood is extinguished in the merging of our souls with the Absolute. However, if we choose to believe our URANTIA Books, we will discover that the universe is populated by an enormous range and number of both descending and ascending children of the Universal Father — but that it is only we unfortunate mortals who have been singled out to start life in a competitive environment in which there is no confirmable evidence that our existence is anything other than an extremely unlikely accident, nor is there confirmable evidence that God really exists. Why would God want to do this to us, what and where is the value?

Our study group has flogged this question. The best we came up with is that God has some inexplicable desire to be loved by the likes of us, the most primitive possible form of self-conscious life. Moreover, he desires that we should offer that love on the basis of a purely faith decision made in an adverse environment amplified by uncertainty and our animal instincts for self-preservation and self-gratification. Does that seem unreasonable? Perhaps when we attain his presence in Paradise, we may find out why. Strange as it may seem, the Havona natives actually envy us!

Undoubtedly this conclusion could have been expressed in more elegant language, but the guts of it would have remained the same. Starting from a state of pure ignorance, without any concrete evidence for God's existence, we are expected to put aside self-interest and to make a free-will commitment to want to be like him. Put in another way, we are required to make a voluntary transition from an initial state of total self-centeredness to a state of total selflessness (no half-measures), on the basis of the flimsiest of evidence that could very well be wrong. What a gamble! No wonder many think we are lunatics!

So what has all this to do with channelling? The crux of the matter is faith. It seems to me that _The URANTIA Book_ (and the Bible) tell me that I have to make my decisions on my own with only a faith belief that my Thought Adjuster and the Spirit of Truth might possibly be helping me. We are told that, as a consequence of rebellion, Urantia is a backward planet with an abnormal and genetically deprived population having limited spiritual capacity. I accept that I am so limited, and know in my heart that I, for one, am a long, long way from close communication with my spirit endowment.

When I think about it, I realise that this apparently disadvantageous situation must have long term benefits for my universe career — otherwise there would be no sense to it. So if there is real value in the mortal situation at all, then the more primitive and backward my condition and environment, and the more I am on my own, then the more opportunity I will have to make those courageous and worthwhile decisions that have the kind of unique and inexplicable cosmic value sufficient to have induced our heavenly Father to put us here in the first place! That surely has to mean we are luckier than those born on a light and life planet where such decision making is bound to be much more restricted. So why should I long for some celestial teacher to tell me what to think and what to do? And for what reason would I want to lessen this once-in-an-eternity opportunity to make my decisions on the basis of an irrational faith?

> However There Are Many Pathways That Lead Us Godward, All With The Same destination.

The trigger that initiated these mixed up musings came from a book entitled Understanding the Present by Bryan Appleyard (Pan Books, London, 1992). He states: “For what does faith mean? Clearly it cannot mean being rationally persuaded of something. If we had reason for faith, then it would not be faith at all, it would be logic. Faith can only be unreasonable”. At first I wanted to argue with that statement but when I boiled it down, I had to acknowledge that a faith decision is one for which there is no hard evidence. Hence it can only be an unsubstantiated hypothesis. There is no way round that conclusion.

_The URANTIA Book_ has lots to say about the necessity to enter the kingdom by faith.

> “_John came preaching repentance to prepare for the kingdom, now have I come proclaiming faith, the gift of God._” ([UB 137:8.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p8_17))

> “_The right to enter the kingdom is conditioned by faith, personal belief._” ([UB 140:8.28](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_28))

> “_By faith, recognize the indwelling spirit of God whose acceptance makes you a son of God._” ([UB 150:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/150#p5_2))

> “_Salvation is by the regeneration of the spirit and not by self-righteous deeds of the flesh. You are justified by faith and fellowshipped by grace._” (1610)

> “_Salvation is the gift of the Father and is revealed by his Sons. Acceptance by faith on your part makes you a partaker of the divine nature, a son or a daughter of God. By faith you are justified; by faith are you saved; and by this same faith are you eternally advanced in the way of progressive and divine perfection._” ([UB 143:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p2_6))

There's lots, lots more on faith in the book, but I like this one:

> “_There is but one struggle for those who enter the kingdom, and that is to fight the good fight of faith. The believer has only one battle, and that is against doubt — unbelief._” ([UB 159:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p3_8))

Two others that I cannot omit are:

> “_Now, mistake not my Father will ever respond to the faintest flicker of faith._” ([UB 155:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_17)) ....and one that happened during the crucifixion: “_When the malefactor saw the face of Jesus turned toward him, he mustered up his courage, fanned the flickering flame of his faith, and said, ‘Lord, remember me when you come into your kingdom?’_” ([UB 187:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/187#p4_1))

And he made it! Can we have any doubt that our heavenly Father really does want us to make a blind faith decision to adopt his goodness as the goal of our life mission?

Following the crucifixion, the resurrected Jesus made an interesting comment to a gathering of believers at Tyre. He said:

> “_You rejoice that the Son of Man has risen from the dead because you thereby know that you and your brethren shall also survive mortal death. But such survival is dependent on your having first been previously bom of the spirit of truth-seeking and God finding._” ([UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2))

...which is, of course, the result of a faith decision. So actually being present to witness the appearance of the resurrected body of Jesus, and to hear (and know) his voice, had no survival value unless a faith decision had already been made. So I ask myself what value can there be in the hearing of voices of celestial teachers in circumstances when even the appearance of Jesus himself would have none?

I make no judgement on the value or validity of the so-called Teaching Mission. I have little doubt that it is bringing many to become believers who might otherwise not have done so. It also appears to be of help for some in making the transition from an intellectual understanding of _The URANTIA Book_ to an actualization of its teachings in their very being. I have no argument against that. But I have read transcripts and I think that I have detected a yearning to be told what to do.

Also I have listened to tapes and have heard participants asking teachers to make decisions for them. I do not think that is what I should do. It seems to me that I would be devaluing God's injunction that I fight the good fight of faith — a faith the value of which is heightened the more adverse the circumstances of its genesis. However there are many pathways that lead us Godward, all with the same destination. It behooves us to wish one another love and bon voyage as you take your path and I take mine.

I leave you with this thought:

> “_I have called upon you to be born again, to be born of the spirit. I have called you out of the darkness of authority and the lethargy of tradition into the transcendent light of the realization of the possibility of making for yourselves the greatest discovery possible for the human soul to make-the supernal experience of finding God for yourself, in yourself, and of yourself, and of doing all this as a fact in your own personal experience._” ([UB 155:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p6_3))

### The Crossroads Of Epochal Revelation

_by Trevor Swadling, Sydney_

After Jesus physically left this planet he left in trust to his ambassadors the continuing work he had trained them for. From our reading we come to love and understand these ambassadors. We also realise their differences and the well-intentioned but sometimes undesirable outcomes that their opinions had on the outworking of the gospel. But these noble men did act. The rest is history. The fourth epochal revelation was partially successful but could have been more so had greater wisdom been exercised. However, one of the world's mightiest religions evolved from these humble beginnings. We look back, shake our heads and think the apostles acted foolishly and think that we have been taught lessons so that when our turn comes we won't make those same mistakes.

We of today have been blessed, through _The URANTIA Book_, with a wealth of information as to why events unfold as they do. As we look into the future from now to the unfolding of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, we should gather and draw wisely on its contents. We have been blessed with a larger revelation and therefore, no doubt, we may be more accountable.

In this task of helping to disseminate the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ in a lasting manner, we all have a part to play. In many ways this may be done, such as: by passing on our values to our children; the daily contact we have with our fellows; the influence through our vocation; placing books in libraries; buying a copy for a friend; pooling our resources and acting as a team; organising ourselves and benefiting from working together; creating a network of readers so new readers can be put in touch with others; fostering study groups; supporting and helping the aims and objectives of URANTIA Foundation, etc. All the above and more are essential to the unfolding of this revelation. “_The act is ours; the consequences God's._” ([UB 48:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_13))

Through ours lives and efforts, in time, many will come across _The URANTIA Book_ or be familiar with its existence. Eventually society will become aware of the social organization of students who represent it. It would be wise and helpful if at this stage the book was established within the book trade in the normal manner, and that people of different cultures and religious backgrounds were readers. The degree of attraction and acceptance to the teachings of the book may be determined by the social fragrance of this organization and by the calibre of the individuals who represent it. It is sensible to have one united social and fraternal organization of students of _The URANTIA Book_.

With this in mind, let's have a look at what could go wrong; how could the revelation be lastingly discredited or watered down? What mistaken actions would make it similar to the partial successes of the first, second, third, or fourth epochal revelations? The outcome will be up to each and every student of _The URANTIA Book_. The possibilities of misinterpretation, bigotry, unfortunate organizational wrangling of themselves will not necessarily dcflate or wreck the revelation itself if there is a strong core of committed readers who are sincerely committed to working to support and foster it.

However one danger to the success of this revelation would be a loss of the identity of the original text after copyright runs out. What will operate to display the original text from other possible adulterated copies? Imagine in a few generations if in front of you are ten URANTIA Books all looking the same, but on closer observation you find meanings have been changed while in others more radical changes have occurred. Some may have been deliberately packaged; changed so that they be better sellers. Different organizations may grow around the different books and more than one may claim to read the authentic text resulting in theological and dogmatic competition amongst believers.

There is an epochal revelation at stake that has been intrusted to be protected and shared with all mankind now and for future generations. As we respect the teachings of the book we should also understand the significance and purpose of the seal that identifies and protects it.

The only thing I can see to avoid this scenario and to protect the original text for all generations to come is that there be only one that has the three azure blue circles placed upon it to distinguish it from the rest. It is worthy to have Michael's emblem upon it. Within its pages is the portrayal of the nature and character of his, and our, heavenly father; an account of the very life and teachings of our Master himself. The way this is achieved in our modern-day world is for the existing trademarks to be maintained. What a sad day it would be if the identity of the original version could not be protected for all time. There is an epochal revelation at stake that has been intrusted to be protected and shared with all mankind now and for future generations. As we respect the teachings of the book we should also understand the significance and purpose of the seal that identifies and protects it. Let us not cheapen this symbol; let us keep it where it belongs. Let us move faithfully and wisely forward in disseminating the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ to the world.

## On Reflection

### Feet Washing

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Queensland_

Their nerves were on edge, their minds confused and, daring not to examine the words of the man all but one dearly loved, those tactless brothers of mine sought to attend the last supper still indulging in the game of their spiritual childhood — vying for position.

Their behaviour gave rise to the beautiful psychodrama of the washing of the feet of Jesus. He gave them the one commandment of the whole of their religion: “_That you love one another even as I have loved you_”. And he also gave the outcome attendant on their following his commandment: “_And by this will all men know that you are my disciples if you love one another_”. He could not spell it out any clearer. He symbolized it to them by proceeding to do the chore of a servant — washing their feet.

Now I know that I could go around washing all the people's feet who happened to cross my path. We also do not wash our feet before sitting down to a meal. Most of us do not take off our shoes, and if we did, they would not be dirty. We have a habit of washing our hands but this is not insisted upon. To the apostles, it brought home what Jesus was asking of them, in a manner hard for us to appreciate.

And so we look to the commandments. The commandments of Moses' day spoke in ‘shalt nots’. The authors of _The URANTIA Book_ refer to how Jesus spoke in positive terms. Our beautiful Creator Son also spelt out the benefits of his instructions whenever he gave them. How blessed we readers are! The students of _The URANTIA Book_ who wish for the escalated spiritualization of this planet are more gifted (favoured?) than those dedicated religionists who do not have the blue book. We know how, as individuals and as a body of readers, we can assist in the undoubted (eventual?) spiritualization of Urantia. We can pull our planet out of its strife-torn and sin-stricken state (I think they were the descriptive words of one revelator) by simply loving one another as Jesus loves us.

Now just in case we get confused in our operational definition of ‘love’ we simply refer to the blue book and we see how Jesus showed his love in more situations than any one of us is ever going to experience in our lifetime here. It is all so easy. Indeed we are spoilt God children.

## Destined For The Skies

_David Glass_

Our life's a gift with God's own guarantee 
That all its many blessings shall not cease.
The life that throbs in human forms we see 
Shall go with us; our forms here rest in peace. 
One's soul is like a lightweight ping-pong sphere
One far immersed beneath the ocean's deep.
But once released, it swims up to be near
The sunlit brilliance of the sky, to sleep
No more, by dark and drifting shadows kept
From finding the blue sky's resplendent gold.
No need is there to have the shadows swept,
Because no soul will linger there once told
Of all the liberty that lives in skies
Where souls find universal family ties.
