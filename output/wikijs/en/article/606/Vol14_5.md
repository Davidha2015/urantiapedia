## Editor's Notebook

Innovative thinking and critical enquiry face many obstacles, and in particular, political processes.

In reviewing the Australian situation, we find it typical of Western nations.

Public servants are expected to remain silent with their views which might be different from those of the government. Does this suggest that government demands. conformity from those from whom it seeks advice? And politicians invariably vote along party lines.

It is common for governments to quote from reports of independent committees of enquiry in order to support government policy. Indeed, it is the government which has set the terms of reference and set the limit of funding on those enquiries.

And elected governments often victimize those who spoke against them during the elections.

Where, among all of this, is the incentive and opportunity for freedom of speech?

Like good works and charity (and optimism) it's to be found at the grass roots level. It is ignored by those in power until its uprising threatens that power.

Because of the risk of retribution, it takes courage to challenge that power. Great reformers then will be those who boldly represent the people in simple, honest terms to those in authority.

Here is another instance where we have the shining example of Jesus.

These comments are offered in a cautionary way against the politicisation of the Urantia movement. Its application is subtle and difficult to identify.

As ‘awareness’ and ‘enlightenment’ are our motivations, we should seek to identify examples of political opportunism wherever they may be.

Editors of publications may be subjected to such pressures. There is a fine division between proselyting and politicising; self interest and general interest; incense and innocence. In the balance, is readership loyalty?

Creative expression can provide insights, solutions and progress. Our collective endeavour will eventually get it right and outweigh the claims of vested interests.

Orthodoxy continues to shift ground to accommodate this sway of opinion. Politicians are especially keen to be its barometer, thereby appealing to the greater number.

How can we track progress and know when orthodoxy becomes obsolete? How can we supplant it with revelation as orthodoxy?

Do we have a book for one season, all seasons or a millennium? Time seems the book's only chance for wider appeal, for its acceptance has proved very narrow indeed.

Perhaps we can look forward to a broader involvement from people, through open debate on the issues raised by the book.

Such discussion needs to be conducted without the restraint of social and political ‘correctness’. We need a dynamic model for the brilliant and innovative concepts we are to address — and implement.

This requires not visionaries but dedicated workers at the grass roots level.

But know that the assimilation of _The URANTIA Book_ teachings, will above all, require courage. And again we are reminded of the courage of Jesus at Livias ([UB 171:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p4_4)), in his discourse at the Temple ([UB 175:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/175#p1_1)), and the trial before the Sanhedrin ([UB 184:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/184#p3_1)).

## So They Say

**‘Time’ Magazine**

We are living in a decentered world, and the publishing business has not been slow to make capital of what investors call the ‘borderless’ economy.

Even a generation ago, most English-language books were divided between the English and American markets; now there are more English-language presses springing up in Singapore, India, and everywhere.

**Alison Cotes — Theologian**

The Pentecostal churches, especially under the title of Assemblies of God, are the fastest growing Christian group in the world.

There are 820 congregations in Australia alone, and worldwide membership now numbers more than 35 million.

Pentecostal worship is characterised by uninhibited emotion, speaking in tongues, and the Old and New Testaments as the direct word of God. And most of all, there is no real theology to grapple with. You are never asked to think.

**Comments On The 1366-Page Novel ‘A Suitable Boy’**

But can it sell in quantities? Seth (the author) himself joked: “The public has limited purses and weak wrists (the book weighs 1.41 kilos)”.

The Publisher mused: “What has been very much on our minds is whether the public has time for a book this long”.

**From ‘Business Ethics: The State Of The Art’ (Ed. Freeman And De George)**

If in some instances it turns out that what is ethical leads to a company's demise, then “so be it”.

**‘Newsweek’ Magazine**

Hindu nationalists, who demand that India redefine itself as a Hindu nation, see their opportunity to seize upon a mood for change.

They call for the country's Hindu majority to shake off the tired socialism of the Congress party, reject traditional Western models and take a prouder place in the world.

Their message to India's 120 million Muslims — one Indian in eight — is stark: accept the dominant culture and lose your identity or accept second-class status in a Hindu state.

## Letters To The Editor

### Drought Hits The Book Stores

_Berkeley Elliott, Oklahoma, USA_

I really got excited about visiting Australia and all my friends there when I received the Registration Form for your October Conference. Unfortunately I will not be able to come this year, but next year may be different.

It is very hard to get copies of _The URANTIA Book_ in English here and very few book stores carry it, since they can't get it from a distributor, only from the Foundation. But hopefully one of these days this will change.

It is really sad they aren't on shelves in book stores.

Hope your Conference is a wonderful success.

### Plus And Minus

_Michael Pither, Roseville, NSW_

Sometimes Six-O-Six gets too damned intellectual and hence confusing for me, especially the Editor's Notebook. Keep it simple! I guess what I mean is that the language used is unnecessarily complex.

Otherwise I am extremely pleased to receive my SixO$-Six and look forward to contributing soon.

### Help Wanted!

_Trevor Swadling, Sydney, NSW_

ANZURA is interested in compiling a study aid for the four parts of _The URANTIA Book_, perhaps as a booklet. We feel this could be helpful in study groups and for individuals as a visual aid. Readers have expressed an interest in having descriptions or various topics available and are keen to help out.

_Six-O-Six is published six tines a year, and editorial contributions are welcomed. Subscription rates: Australia $10 per year. Other countries $15 per year. Please remit in Australian dollars. The material contained in this publication is of general comment only and not advice on any particular natter The publisher. authors and editors expressly disclaim all liability in respect of this information and of the consequences of any actions resulting therefrom.

## News Around The World

### Let Your Fingers Do The Walking

Australian capital city telephone books now list The URANTIA Foundation's Sydney office. This will assist interested readers to find out more details about _The URANTIA Book_.

This project was made possible by the generosity of members of ANZURA.

The Foundation Office is also listed under the heading of ‘Book Publishers’ in the Yellow Pages.

### Big Electronic Brother

News Corporation Limited has plans to create a global communications empire. This will give the group the capability to provide endless data and information even electronic newspapers — to every individual everywhere in the world.

Traditional distinctions are breaking down. Five of the world's biggest industries — computing, communications, consumer electronics, publishing and entertainment — are converging into one large dynamic whole, with News's Chief Executive agreeing: “We are on the edge of a technological revolution”.

### Catholic Priorities

Intense speculation is developing about the soon-tobe-released papal encyclical: ‘The Splendor of the Truth’.

Commentators on this issue believe it will distract the moral energy of the Catholic church away from ethical issues such as social justice, environmental degradation and world population.

It is difficult to know what ideologies the church is expected to address. What is interesting is that the church is so openly questioned about its ability to come to terms with contemporary needs. It will be interesting to see how it interprets its spiritual responsibility while conforming with Scripture and tradition.

### Peace Breaks Out

In an historic pact which recognises the legitimacy of Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), one hundred years of fighting between Palestinians and Jews could come to an end.

Both Islamic fundamentalists and many right-wing Israelis oppose the idea as do many Jewish settlers. The optimists sce peace talks progressing between Israel and Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Beyond the inevitable problems is the notion that there are peaceful solutions, for violence has never achieved its aims.

### “I Salute The God Within You”

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Qld._

Two strange ways of behaviourally responding to Jesus' commandment to ‘Love one another as I have loved you’ are:

1. To salute the God within another person.
2. To love a person's Thought Adjuster.

Frankly I feel that these are rather poor substitutes for love as exemplified by Jesus. I also find it a little sad that folks would salute God wherever they chose to see Him. As our loving Father, perhaps a spiritual cuddle, some expression of love, might be more appropriate than a military signal of acknowledgement of position.

I try to deliberate on the rationale behind loving the God within another, rather than the individual, and quite appreciate how easy it is to love the former and how darned difficult it is to love the latter. Be that as it may, I verily believe that it is no substitute at all for the following of Jesus' commandment in relation to our brothers and sisters.

How do we learn to understand God the Supreme? Simple!

> “_Man can discover the Father in his heart, but he will have to search for the Supreme in the hearts of all other men._”" ([UB 117:6.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_23))

So this following of Jesus' commandment has a double-barrelled effect, for not only do we get to be Jesus' disciples but we also discover the Supreme!

Not once in _The URANTIA Book_ do I gain even the vaguest hint of Jesus having a fleeting thought along the lines of: “I give up. This person is totally unlovable. The only thing I can find of any value in them is their Thought Adjuster”.

_The URANTIA Book_ is littered with constant reminders that we are to love the individual:

> “_I send you forth, not to love the souls of men, but rather to love men._” ([UB 191:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/191#p5_3))

> “_Jesus could help men so much because he loved them sincerely. He truly loved each man, each woman, and each child._” ([UB 171:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_4))

> “_‘Be of good cheer.’ He could maintain this confident attitude because of his unswerving trust in God and his unshakable confidence in man, He was always touchingly considerate of all men because he loved them and believed in them._” ([UB 100:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p7_9))

He would interrupt a serious conference with his apostles to fraternize with an intruding child. Nothing ever seemed so important to Jesus as the individual human who chanced to be in his immediate presence. (1545)

And we URANTIA Book students are blessed with the exact formula as to how to love as Jesus loves:

> “_In physical life the senses tell of the existence of things; mind discovers the reality of meanings; but the spiritual experience reveals to the individual the true values of life. These high levels of human living are attained in the supreme love of God and in the unselfish love of man. If you love your fellow men, you must have discovered their values. Jesus loved men so much because he placed such a high value upon them. You can best discover values in your associates by discovering their motivation. If some one irritates you, causes feelings of resentment, you should sympathetically seek to discern his viewpoint, his reasons for such objectionable conduct. If once you understand your neighbor, you will become tolerant, and this tolerance will grow into friendship und ripen into love._” ([UB 100:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p4_4))

Increasingly they learned from Jesus to look upon human personalities in terms of their possibilities in time and in eternity. They learned that many souls can best be led to love the unseen God by being first taught to love their brethren whom they can see. And it was in this connection that new meaning became attached to the Master's pronouncement concerning unselfish service for one's fellows:

> “_Inasmuch as you did it to one of the least of my brethren, you did it to me._” ([UB 155:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p3_4))

> “_Jesus loved men so much and so wisely that he never hesitated to be severe with them when the occasion demanded such discipline. He frequently set out to help a person by asking for help. In this way he elicited interest, appealed to the better things in human nature._” ([UB 171:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_7))

It is blatantly clear that God and Jesus want us not to love the God in an individual, but rather the individual themselves. It is inconceivable that God is narcissistic desirous of spending his day admiring his image as his children gaze at their brothers and sisters. Whose love is it anyway? Love comes from God. He gives it to us to give to our brothers and sisters.

I cannot believe that God wants us to love him in others, whilst totally ignoring the unique, never to be repeated personality, trapped within the very confused mind of a decidedly ugly little human. What did God ask of Jesus? His wish is that not one be lost. Can a Thought Adjuster go astray? No! What God is asking is that we love that which he so much treasures — the cherished personality he has created. He asks us to approach the unlovable with an attilude of true love. Like that beautiful mind picture painted of the snarling cave man (1098), he asks us to truly love the personality housed within our brother and sister, so that he can help us to expand the picture of their being, so that we can understand why they are as they are. Perhaps in the process, they will gain insight into the possibility of adopting different attitudes, beliefs, values, and emotions — simply because we offer our genuine, sincere love. This love may say: “I know you don't believe you are lovable. I even recognize you believe love is for the birds, that you feel that I am of no interest or value to you. I recognize all of this, and I love you because of the unique individual that you are. But if I change the subject from you to your actual behaviour, I can sum that in two words — it stinks!”

> What God Is Asking Is That We Love That Which He So Much Treasures — The cherished personality he has created. He asks us to approach the unlovable with an attitude of true love.

Why cannot we look at folks as.lesus and God do? We run around trying to save the whales and the African tree-climbing rhinosaurus whilst treating, with the sublimest disregard, that rare entity — our brother and sister. There is only one of them. That is all God made. If one dies, there is no more. For an eternity there is a sadness borne of the memory of that person within God the Supreme — a cherished memory for which God had great dreams. Each individual is a personality created by God. Each loss of an individual personality causes sadness in God as he accepts that individual's decision not to transform the dream into an eternal reality.

So let's all try to love one another as Jesus loves us, as he exemplified in his love for all the folks he met in his life down here. And then begins the fun of disappointment, adversity, sadness and all the lovely, painful growth material. Without a doubt it would be a blessed relief to escape into the illusionary way of thinking that “God really wants me to love Him, not my brothers and sisters. How can I love someone who is trying to convince me with all of their might that they have not a single trait worthy of a human being — that they are truly an animal?” But God would not ask the impossible of me! God does not ask me to love the traits of a person, he asks me to love the person.

And the benefit to us? Just as it was with Jesus:

> “_...his real education — that equipment of mind and heart for the actual test of grappling with the difficult problems of life — he obtained by mingling with his fellow men. It was this close association with his fellow men, young and old, Jew and gentile, that afforded him the opportunity to know the human race. Jesus was highly educated in that he thoroughly understood men and devotedly loved them._” ([UB 123:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/123#p5_8))

Now, as an aside, on the subject of animals. If we happen to meet some human who tries really hard to convince us that they are a decidedly antisocial and undomesticated animal, then what can we do? Bearing in mind the “wise as serpents, gentle as doves” advice of Jesus, as well as the “not casting pearls before swine” talk that he gave us, perhaps we can discover some very interesting techniques for interaction with such an individual, by examining relationships between two-legged humans who have the capacity to love, and four-legged animals who are decidedly distrustful of humans.

Warily at first, but then with surety born of continuity of attitude towards them, some will develop trust. Any animal lover can advise you as to how to develop such a relationship by interacting with the wary animal, not forcing yourself upon them, or overwhelming their timid being. Gradually, regularly, and with consistency of manner, jou approach the animal; gently you gain their confidence. You watch ever so carefully so as to understand their fears and moods. And they, for their part, are also watching you. One sign of inconsistency, uncontrolled display of annoyance, anger, or frustration and you can do irreparable damage to a budding relationship.

> Each individual is a personality created by God. Each loss of an individual personality causes sadness in God as he accepts that individual's decision not to transform the dream into an eternal reality.

You give time. Slowly, timidly, they start to approach. Each day they become a little more confident, and finally your staunch ally. You get labelled a friend. They know you as well as you know them. The ground rules for the relationship are established. It is a friendship based on trust, respect and understanding.

Perhaps with some humans the way to walk them through to belief in themselves, to assist them to rise to the stature of their human potential, is by some similar means. I do not really know, for many humans are so incredibly frightened.

However, a pleasant and sincere word as we pass by, if there are enough of such expressions of recognition and kindness by enough people, may have such a person start to think that maybe this trusting and friendship stuff has some merit.

And the next person who comes along, genuinely acknowledging their unique individuality, loving and respecting them as a person, might be the catalyst that has them dare to try — try to trust and love. And at that moment, the soil of their mind is fertile for their Thought Adjuster to get through a message of truth and love from our Father.

> “_Jesus said to John: ‘John, do you love me’? And when John answered: ”‘Yes, Master, with all my heart’“, the Master said: ‘Then, John, give up your intolerance and learn to love men as I have loved you. Devote your life to proving that love is the greatest thing in the world.’_” ([UB 192:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/192#p2_1))

### The Power Of The Spirit Of Truth

_Dr. A. W. Tozer_

(Dr. Tozer was a pastor of the Southside Alliance Church in Chicago from 1928 to 1959. These excerpts are taken from his writings. It is fascinating to compare the concepts he expresses with _The URANTIA Book_.)

A doctrine or concept has practical value only as far as it is prominent in our thoughts and makes a difference in our lives. Paul said: “But the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto him; neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned”. ([1 Cor. 2:14](/en/Bible/1_Corinthians/2#v14))

In religion more than in any other field of human experience, a sharp distinction must always be made between ‘knowing about’ and ‘knowing’. To the question “What is Spirit like?” the answer must always be, “He is like Jesus”. Man, by reason, cannot know God; he can only know about God. But there is such a thing as a gift of knowledge, a gift that comes from heaven. Jesus taught his disciples to expect the coming of the Spirit of Truth who would teach them all things — even to know God.

Everywhere we find Christians who are book-taught but not Spirit-taught. They conceive truth to be something they can grasp with the mind. But there is no truth apart from the Spirit. The most brilliant intellect may be imbecilic when confronted with the mysteries of God. For a person to understand revealed truth requires an act of God.
ç
Jesus said: “Tarry in the City of Jerusalem until ye be endued with Power from on high”. By these words Jesus raised the expectation of his disciples and taught them to look forward to the coming of a supernatural potency into their natures from a source outside themselves. This was to be nothing less that God himself entering into them with the purpose of ultimately reproducing his own likeness within them.

Jesus also said: "Ye shall have power. This power is sufficient; no additional help is needed, for it is the Holy Spirit of God come where weakness lay, to supply power and grace to meet the moral need.

Set over against this, ethical Christianity is seen to be no Christianity at all. It is an infantile copying of Jesus' ‘ideals’, a pitiable effort to carry out the teachings of the Sermon on the Mount! All this is but child's play. It is not the faith of Jesus.

The power from the Spirit operates on another level and affects another department of God's creation. It is spiritual power. It is the kind of power that God is. It is the ability to achieve spiritual and moral ends. Its long range result is to produce God-like character in men and women who were once much less than holy by nature and choice.

How does the Spirit operate? At its purest, it is an unmediated force directly applied by the Spirit of Truth to the spirit of man.

In the light of this it will be seen how empty and meaningless is the average church service [conference, study group] today. All the means are in evidence; the one ominous weakness is the absence of the Spirit's power.

To the absence of the Spirit may be traced that vague sense of unreality which almost everywhere invests religion in our times. We hear words but they do not register; we cannot relate them to anything in our own life-level. We are aware of no ‘Power’, no ‘Presence’, no ‘Spiritual reality’.

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia" alt="Dali">
<img src="/image/article/606/Dali.jpg">
</figure>

One meaning of the word ‘power’ is the ability to do. There, precisely, is the wonder of the Spirit's work — his sure ability to make spiritual things real to the soul. This power can go straight to its object with piercing directness. Reality is its subject matter. It does not create objects which are not there but reveals objects already present and hidden from the soul. In actual human experience this is likely to be first felt in the heightened sense of the presence of Jesus — who is felt to be a real person and to be intimately, ravishingly near.

Grace, forgiveness, cleansing take on a form of almost bodily clearness. Prayer loses its unmeaning quality and becomes sweet conversation with someone who is actually there. Love for God and for the children of God take possession of the soul. The world comes to take on a hard outline before our minds and begins to invite our interest and devotion. Then the whole life changes to suit the new reality and the change is permanent.

I think there can be no doubt that the need above all other needs at this moment is the power of the Spirit of Truth. More education, better organization, finer equipment, more advanced methods — all are unavailing. They are like administering resuscitation after the patient is dead. Good as these things are they can never give life. “It is the Spirit that quickeneth.” Good as they are they can never bring power. “Power belongeth to God.”

I should like to suggest that we believers announce a moratorium on religious activity and set our house in order preparatory to the coming of the afflatus from above. I believe we should profit immensely were we to declare a period of silence and self-examination during which each one of us searched his own heart and sought to meet every condition for a real baptism from on high.

We may be sure of one thing, that for our deep trouble there is no cure apart from a visitation, yes, an invasion of power from above. Only the Spirit himself can show us what is wrong with us and only the Spirit can prescribe the cure.

Only the Spirit can save us from the numbing unreality of a Spiritless revelation. Only the inworking of the Spirit's power can discover the solemn majesty and the heart ravishing mystery of the Triune God.

Here is the whole final message of the gospel: through the life, death and resurrection of Jesus, we mortals may become one with God — Deity indwelling men! That is the gospel's fullest effectuation, and even those glories of the world to come will be, in essence, but a greater and more perfect experience of the soul's union with God. Deity indwelling men! That, I say, is the gospel and no one has experienced rightly the power of belief until they have known this for themselves as a living reality.

The deep disease of the human heart is a will broken loose from its center. Any adequate scheme for cure must undertake to restore again the human will to its proper place in the will of God. In accord with this underlying need for healing, the Spirit, when he effects his gracious invasion of the believing heart, must win that heart to glad and voluntary obedience to the whole will of God. The cure must be wrought from within; no outward conformity will do.

The Spirit achieves this inward cure by merging our will with his own. It is the work of the in-living Spirit to point out our moral discrepancies and correct them. But he does not, as is sometimes said, ‘break’ the human will. He invades it and brings it gently to joyous union with the will of God.

To will the will of God is more than just an unprotesting consent to it; it is rather to choose God's will with positive determination. Then, as the work of the Spirit advances, we find ourselves free to choose whatever we will, and we gladly choose the will of God as the highest conceivable good. Such then is life's goal, one that places us beyond the disappointments that plague the rest of humanity. Whatever happens now is the will of God for us.

I want here to assert that is my happy belief that every Christian can have a copious outpouring of the Spirit of Truth in a measure beyond what most of us think possible. But we must get this straight — until all doubts are removed, faith is impossible — and the outpouring will not happen.

## The Book Study And Discussion

### The 1993 International Conference For Urantia Book Readers, Montreal, Canada

_Betty Glasziou, Maleny, Qld_

The Conference, held at St. Hyacinthe, Montreal, Canada from Saturday 31st July to Thursday 5th August, 1993 , was an unqualified success. In fact, the almost 800 URANTIA Book readers who gathered together from all over the world were so friendly, and generated so much goodwill, it was almost a foretaste of the Mansion Worlds. The Conference itself was spiritually illuminating and was without a hint of discord or politics.

For me, the most wonderful experiences were the Plenary Praise and Worship sessions for 1.5 hours every morning following breakfast. The psalmist once wrote that “God inhabits the praises of his people”. The spiritual channels were certainly open when our emotions and minds were stimulated by the beauty, harmony, and transcendence of musical expression. Instead of just listening to others praising God, we all joined in with our hearts, souls and voices. We all experienced feelings of unity and joy with this type of singing and worship. During all of this incredible music, the most beautiful scenes of natural beauty from all over Canada and the United States were being projected onto a huge screen, orchestrated by Larry Geiss. Joshua Wilson, a church minister from Arizona who works mainly with orphanages, co-ordinated the wonderful singers on stage whilst playing the keyboard and narrating with a most beautiful voice. This and many other parts of the Conference were videotaped so that, when we get the video, we will be able to share the experiences with our fellow readers in New Zealand and Australia.

After the musical worship sessions, we had a speaker each morning, beginning with an excellent address by Steve Dreier, President of the F.E.F. It was a very spiritual address. This huge theatre could seat at least 1000 people in comfort.

After lunch, there were many talks and workshops by many talented people. There was one whole tower of this beautiful hotel, the ‘Auberge des Seigneurs’, devoted solely to rooms especially designed for this type of conference. Workshop rooms had a huge table in each, with four separate sides around which one could sit, listen, take notes and engage in discussion. Each table seated 20 people. The lecture theatres were much larger with 50 very comfortable chairs in a semi-circle and a podium for the speaker. There were so many workshops and talks going on, it just wasn't possible to attend all of them. One outstanding talk that I attended was by Dr. Meredith Sprunger who spoke on the future of the Fifth Epochal Revelation. It was really wonderful and we will have it on video. He did start by saying that he had been moved to tears by the praise and worship sessions every morning and wanted to know why it had taken us 35 or more years to do this — and we all agreed. If this was a foretaste of worship sessions on the Isle of Paradise, no wonder it is so overwhelming ([UB 27:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/27#p7_2)).

The hotel was excellent, the rooms luxurious, and the food superlative. The different towers of the hotel rise up around a beautiful rainforest with birds and a lagoon. Bobby Dreier said this was the first time that the conference had been held in such surroundings — usually it is much more spread out. She thought it was such an unqualified success because we were all able to meet together so much more easily. There were many coffee bars and lounges in the hotel apart from the huge dining room and the smaller restaurants.

> In fact, the ... readers who gathered together from all over the world were so friendly, and generated so much goodwill, it was almost a foretaste of the Mansion Worlds.

There was a free day on the Tuesday with many options available to choose from. Some of us chose the day in Quebec and it certainly is a fascinating and historical city. The day culminated in an inspirational musical laser show in the magnificent cathedral, the ‘Notre Dame de Quebec’.

I had better not start on all the wonderful people who attended the Conference from all over the world or I would never finish. The Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado folk were there in force with great musical talent. Apart from the music, the Boulder folk put on a wonderful Larry Mullins' play with each character presenting their impression of Jesus, the man (e.g. Mary, his mother, Joseph, Martha, Mary, Lazarus, Andrew, and Caiaphas). It was so very well done.

We were all sorry when the six-day Conference ended, but it was a wonderful experience to meet people we had previously only known by name, making new friends and catching up with many old friends from different parts of the world. At the close, Janet Harrington gave the final address on the theme of the Conference, ‘Touch the World’, emphasizing the need for URANTIA Book readers to fulfil the role of peacemakers in their respective communities. It starts with each single one of us — a smile, a kindness, a comforting word and a helping hand to our fellow travellers on Urantia. There was such a happy atmosphere of goodwill! Hopefully, we can all go on out into the world in our daily lives doing as our beloved Master did, spreading love and good cheer as we pass by. We really can touch the world.

### Greetings From Finland

_Seppo Niskanen, Mannerheimintie_

The Finnish Urantia Society International Summer Conference, which was held during the second weekend of June 1993 turned into a celebration of the fact that first copies of _URANTIA-kirja_, the Finnish translation of _The URANTIA Book_, were out from the printing press, along with _El libro de URANTIA_, the Spanish translation, and Hakemisto, the Finnish Index.

The Summer Conference of 1993 , which was the ninth such conference in a row, took place at Järvenpää, a town in the neighbourhood of the Finnish capital of Helsinki. The Conference was attended by 120 URANTIA Book readers from Finland and eight readers from the United States. Urantia Foundation was represented by four of the Trustees, headed by Patricia Mundelius, the Foundation President.

In her speech to the Conference, she stated: “We very much enjoyed reading the lead article in ‘Reflection’ describing the years and years of work and the number of people involved in giving birth to the Finnish translation. Your dedication and steadfastness along with your beautiful teamwork have made this happen”.

Seppo Kanerva, the translator of the Finnish _URANTIA-kirja_, said in his speech: “Two important steps have been taken simultaneously, and so some five and a half million Finnish-speaking people and the some 350 million speakers of Castilian now have access to the fifth epochal revelation, in their native languages”. The translator likewise reminded the Conference of getting ever more and new translations accomplished, and also of the necessity of having _The URANTIA Book_ translated into non-European languages: “We are taught that nothing which human nature has touched can be regarded as infallible. The very moment the fourth epochal revelation was entrusted into human hands, the potential existed to make Michael's bestowal a white man's religion” ([UB 94:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p4_10)).

In telling us this, the revelator's want to say: “Do not repeat these same mistakes in your human management of the fifth epochal revelation. Let it not become something of your private enjoyment only, let it not become the treasure of one race, or one nation, or one group. Let it not be transformed from a gospel of and in _The URANTIA Book_ into an institutionalized religion about and around _The URANTIA Book_, outside which there is no salvation”.

Juhani Leino, the Society President, dwelled upon the need to defend _The URANTIA Book_, something that some readers seem to regard as needful as much as they consider it needful to print it for every Urantian to read. Said he: "While it is a fact that _The URANTIA Book_ incorporates utterly important information and good tidings to mankind, one may think that the rightful thing to do is to print it, ceaselessly and at an accelerating tempo, for every Urantian to read. It is worthwhile remembering, however, that long before _The URANTIA Book_ was published, there was a fellow in the Levant who truly lived its teachings. What I mean is that The URAN$T L A$ Book, as a book, does not help anything or anybody unless one truly lives its message and teachings...

“It may appear heroic if someone defends _The URANTIA Book_ at public panel discussions, in newspaper articles, etc. I, though, am fully convinced that _The URANTIA Book_ needs not that kind of defending. Should someone find himself in a defence situation, he does well to make a self-assessment along these lines: Could it be that I, after all, am a disbeliever and a coward. And when I assume that I am defending the book, in reality, what I am defending is the rightfulness of my faith...”

“The readers of _The URANTIA Book_, of course feel annoyed when the book is given an assessment on false grounds. If this is the case, maybe this quotation from Mark Twain affords some relief to each of us: ‘Adam was nothing more than human, and that explains everything. He did not eat of the apple because it was an apple, but because it was forbidden. Had it not been forbidden, he'd have eaten the snake”.

> It is worthwhile remembering, however, that long before _The URANTIA Book_ was published, there was a fellow in the Levant who truly lived its teachings. What I mean is that _The URANTIA Book_, as a book, does not help anything or anybody unless one truly lives its message and teachings...

Apart from the celebration of the translations, the Conference divided up into about a dozen discussion groups. These discussion groups made an attempt to define what righteousness truly is; the issue of races and racism was the theme of one group, and so was prayer as a religious experience. One group focussed on matter, mind, and spirit, another on resurrection and life. One group made an endeavour to come into terms with art, another with astronomy in the light of _The URANTIA Book_. One group devoted itself to the multifaceted problem of world religions; also fears and the inevitabilities of life were analyzed. Even physical pleasures had not been ignored — it was the theme of one of the groups.

The Conference site at Järvenpää, almost next door to the one-time home and museum of the Finnish composer Jean Sibelius, was unanimously found excellent, and consequently a decision was reached that the Summer Conference of 1994 will be held in the same premises. Hence, there will be another International Conference during the second weekend of June 1994 at the same place. Welcome everybody.

## The Forum

### The Revelations Of Divine Truth Are Not Sealed...

_The Sunshine Coast Study Group_

Following Trevor Swadling's Forum article (July/August) on ways and means (as well as possible problems that will arise) of spreading the message of _The URANTIA Book_, we would like to draw attention to a section in the book itself that addresses many of the issues.

The ‘Nature of Cultism’ ([UB 87:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_1)) tells us that every revelation has given rise to a new cult, and implies that this is a virtual necessity for the successful dissemination of a revelation. The point is stressed that, to be successful, a cult must fulfil a variety of functions, but that a paramount requisite is the need to remain elastic and adaptable.

The same section remarks that the early Christian cult was the most effective, appealing, and enduring ever conceived or devised, then informs us that:

> “_...even the restatement of the religion of Jesus must develop a new and appropriate symbolism...predicated on the Fatherhood of God and...the Brotherhood of Man._” ([UB 87:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_6))

The Declaration of Trust that created the Urantia Foundation proclaims that the principal objectives are to promote the true teachings of Jesus, the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man through “the fostering of a religion, a philosophy, and a cosmology...”

Probably all religions have their roots in a cult of some sort. If we are to follow the recommendations of the book and the above principal objectives, the early formation of a Urantia cult is now an urgent imperative. So how did the paranoia associated with antipathy towards cults and religious organization develop in the Urantia movement?

One of the contributing factors may have been the distraction brought about by the mistaken concept, emphasized in Trevor Swadling's article, concerning the essentiality of maintaining the original text inviolate for generations to come, together with the means of accomplishing this through use of the distinctive brand mark of the three azure blue circles. Another factor may have been the expectation that the mass spreading of the inviolate text, rather than the need for a host of people actually living the message of the book, was the priority requirement.

It is a fact of life that languages are evolutionary and that their rate of evolution is relatively rapid. Already, the meaning of many words present in _The URANTIA Book_ has altered since the receipt of the original text, sometimes causing considerable confusion amongst some readers. Societies also undergo evolution. Today, an author submitting text such as found in _The URANTIA Book_ to a major publishing house would likely have the manuscript returned with instructions to remove the sexist terminology (e.g. Fatherhood of God, Brotherhood of Man, mankind, etc.).

In the not too distant future, when the copyright is no longer valid, legitimate scholars will want to modernize the language of _The URANTIA Book_ in order to present the true intent and meaning of the 1934/5 Papers to current generations. In doing so, they will seek the earliest available documentation, which will be those copies of the book issued in the first printing. Genuine scholars will know that the text of all subsequent printings has been altered, hence will want to work only from the text of the first printing. There is little that can now be done about preserving that text. The continuing retention of a registered trade mark over the three concentric circles no longer serves any effective purpose in ensuring the validity of those original copies from the first printing.

> Should the current text be preserved inviolate? Obviously not, as it is already misleading, and there are objectionable sexist and racist implications that have arisen due to changes in the way we think, the way we use language and the way society has developed since the mid-1930's.

Should the current text be preserved inviolate? Obviously not, as it is already misleading, and there are objectionable sexist and racist implications that have arisen due to changes in the way we think, the way we use language and the way society has developed since the mid-1930's. The book itself is quite emphatic about this point:

> “_But the greatest error of the teaching about the Scriptures is the doctrine of their being sealed books of mystery and wisdom which only the wise minds of the nation dare to interpret. The revelations of divine truth are not sealed except by human ignorance, bigotry, and narrow-minded intolerance. The light of Scriptures is only dimmed by prejudice and darkened by superstition. A false fear of sacredness has prevented religion from being safeguarded by common sense. The fear of authority of the sacred writings of the past effectively prevents the honest souls of today from accepting the new light of the gospel, the light which those very God-knowingmen of another generation so intensely longed to see_”. ([UB 159:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p4_9))

For the sake of future generations, one of our needs will be a continuous stream of updated (but scholarly) revisions of the text of the first printing. As with the Bible, open competition among such scholars is the way to get the best revision. The same reasoning applies to translations.

We believe that the book itself has always called for a grass roots movement made up of a multitude of in- dividuals doing their utmost to actually live the teachings of the book. Primarily, these are the teachings of Jesus. When that multitude attains a critical mass, the teachings will take off explosively.

Secondary works are essential for the generation of the critical mass of those who really live the teachings. Let us add the plea that the urgent need for the formation of many experimental cults to evolve an effective symbolism from which may arise a new but evolving religion founded on the truths of _The URANTIA Book_.

The initial momentum for the dissemination of the English language editions of _The URANTIA Book_ has come to a grinding halt. A new surge can arise from individual and collective efforts at the grass roots level. It's up to us.

## On Reflection

### Does God Dream Beautiful Equations?

_Shirley Twist in ‘The Australian’_

The structures of science are evidence of the existence of God, according to Dr. John Polkinghorne, who is both a Cambridge professor of mathematical physics and an Anglican priest.

Dr. Polkinghorne, in Brisbane for a special lecture at the University of Queensland, says the search for truth common to science and religion is also the key to their reconciliation.

"Science and religion are both true and they tell me about different aspects of the world and its history. If we believe we are seeking to serve the God of truth then I don't think we should fear truth from whatever source it comes.

“When you read the Bible, you must ask yourself what you are reading. It's a very big mistake to read poetry as if it were prose. If you read Robert Burns and a poem says, ”My love is like a red, red rose", it doesn't mean his girlfriend has green leaves and prickles.

"Where the Bible talks about the six days of Creation and the rest on the seventh day, that's not a literal blowby-blow account of how it really happened. It's meant to be a sort of theological poem saying that the world in all its fruitfulness exists because God willed it to be so.

"One of the things I think people find difficult is that science deals with impersonal experience where we can put things to a test, whereas in all forms of personal relationships, whether they're between one human being and another or whether they're between human beings and God, they're based not on testing but on trusting.

"Sometimes people find it difficult to recognise that if you're going to find out the truth about the world, you have to find it in both the impersonal, scientific way and also in the personal, religious way.

“I think that the soul is the real me and that the real me is not the matter of my body but the rich, complicated pattern in which that matter is organised. When I die, that pattern will be dissolved but God remembers that pattern and recreates it in the new world of his choosing.”

Dr. Polkinghorne's visit was sponsored by the Institute for the Study of Christianity in an Age of Science and Technology.

### The Golden Rule

The teaching that we should treat others as we ourselves would wish to be treated is an ethic variously repeated in all the major religions:

_Buddhism_

“Hurt not others in ways that you yourself would find hurtful.” Udana-Varqa, 5:18.

_Zoroastrianism_

“That nature only is good when it shall not do unto another whatever is not good for oneself.” Dadistan-iDinik, 94:5.

_Judaism_

“What is hateful to you, do not to your fellow men. That is the entire Law, all the rest is commentary.” The Talmud, Shabbat, 31a.

_Hinduism_

“This is the sum of all true righteousness: deal with others as thou wouldst thyself be dealt by. Do nothing to thy neighbour which thou would not have him do to thee after.” The Mahabharata.

_Christianity_

“As ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise.” [Luke 6:31](/en/Bible/Luke/6#v31).

“All things whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the prophets.” [Matthew 7:12](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v12).

_Islam_

“No one of you is a believer until he desires for his brother that which he desires for himself.” Sunnah.

_Taoism_

“The good man ought to pity the malignant tendencies of others; to rejoice over their excellence; to help them in their straits; to regard their gains as if they were his own, and their losses in the same way.” The ThaiShang, 3.

_Confucianism_

“Surely it is the maxim of loving kindness: Do not unto others that you would not have them do unto you.” Analects, X V, 23.

_Baha'i_

“It is our wish and desire that every one of you may become a source of all goodness unto men, and an example of uprightness to mankind. Beware lest ye prefer yourselves above your neighbours.” Baha'u'llah, Gleanings, 315.

## When All Is Said And Done

> “_And so I give you this new commandment: that you love one another as I have loved you. And by this all men will know that you are my disciples if you thus love one another._” ([UB 180:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_1))
