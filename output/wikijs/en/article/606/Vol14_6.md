## Editor's Notebook

With this issue, Six-O-Six completes fourteen years of continuous publication.

It also marks the time for change. In its current format, Six-O-Six will not continue.

The publication has, over the years, shifted ground while endeavouring to accommodate varied opinion into it's central theme — generating goodwill and understanding among readers of _The URANTIA Book_.

However, the book is no longer viewed in the light of its teachings alone. Other religious and philosophical interests, debate on personal issues and legal and political argument on dissemination are seeking to dominate. This sounds a familiar story.

With its ‘narrow’ editorial policy, Six-O-Six has been accused by all special interest groups of having a hostile disposition towards them.

It is hoped that appropriate publications, as required, will now arise as a legacy. I will be happy to consider sending first editions of any new publications, postage paid, to the current readership of Six-O-Six. However I will not release the address list to anyone.

Thanks are due in abundance to many for their Six-OSix creativity, but I shall nominate just a few for special effort: Delphius, David Glass, Ken Glasziou, Tony Rudd and my unfailing supportive family.

More importantly, I want to thank from the bottom of my heart, our small band of dedicated readers over the years. I constantly get feedback from people everywhere in appreciation of our efforts. I also get feedback about the quality image the newsletter has, and I am not making this change without considerable thought to its implications.

The future? I believe it is time for the teachings to filter to a wider audience. Nothing new in that. But currently our publications represent book readers talking to each other. That has been essential and still has relevance but it is not enough.

The general audience is not buying it. I further believe the 1990s will raise spiritual/moral issues into the midst of politics and the media. The demand for accountability is the secondary reason for this happening.

The primary reason is the people want it. We need it, we feel it inside, we live it.

As ‘living’ and ‘roles’ are being redefined, people seek inner resources for coping with the incredible change. There is recourse back to tradition and inner values and more discussion on religion and ethical matters can be expected.

Also, a life of meaning has to be found in our world of high unemployment. A career of personal development that in turn can enrich others needs to be part of a successful educational system. Vocational labels will have less cultural significance and the worth of the individual needs to be recognised.

But the most difficult task is to stay in touch and care at personal levels. This is a paradox in times of global communications. We must find ways for technology to draw us closer together.

With our need for stability to counterbalance change, we'll want good local communities with a sense of mutual obligation. Spiritual interests can grow in a sensible environment. And the cynics in the public arenas will have difficulty ridiculing true experiences. A publication needs to contribute to this sense of community, of family. So following a timely recess, a new journal will be researched and complied in an endeavour to do this.

The teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ will be contained within it but not by name. It will be for general readership.

I look forward to being in contact when this journal becomes a reality.

## So They Say

**Rupert Murdoch, Publisher**

Gone are the days when a few newspaper publishers could sit down and agree to keep a whole nation ignorant.

**Brooks Atkinson (1951)**

We need Supermen to rule us — the job is so vast and the need for wise judgement is so urgent. But, alas, there are no supermen.

**Lauchlan Chipman, Writer/Philosopher**

While Rand's objectivism has made zero impact on mainstream philosophy, it has spawned literally thousands of disciples, mainly outside universities.

In part this may reflect an appetite for philosophising in the wider community that most professional philosophers continue to neglect. More ominously, I fear, it reveals a craving for certainty in relation to fundamental questions which neither religious dogma nor political ideology any longer provide.

**Philip Adams, Satirist**

Here is the news. Scientists at the CSIRO have succeeded in isolating the religion virus. This dread contagion, more virulent than bubonic plague, has been decimating human populations for thousands of years. By lowering the healthy scepticism in the immune system, it allows fanaticism to eat into the brain. The ability to think for oneself is destroyed and there are increasing outbreaks of irrationality.

Delusions can follow, wherein the sufferer sees visions and hears voices. Inflamed emotions can lead to a wide range of antisocial activities. Although the virus has now been identified, progress on the vaccine will be retarded because of the need to experiment with humans.

**‘Bulletin’ Magazine, September, 1993**

World astronomy is buzzing with the news. The planet Jupiter is likely to be struck by a comet in the last week of July 1994, with an estimated release of energy equivalent to thousands of millions of tonnes of TNT. The effects should be visible on earth.

### How To Become More Jesus-Like

_Tony Rudd, Melbourne_

The 1993 URANTIA Book Readers' Conference at the Gold Coast is over. As Neil has mentioned elsewhere in this special conference issue of Six-O-Six, it was a terrific gathering for all concerned. The theme ‘Welcome to the Shores of Paradise’ was defined in more practical terms as “sharing insights on how we envisage we can spiritually grow [by] better communication with the divine monitor that dwells within the human mind”.

Neil provided an excellent opportunity for individual readers to give short personal accounts of how they strive to do this, as he explains in the ‘On Reflection’ section in this issue. He also afforded a group-oriented opportunity for all participants to put in their views, with group leaders reporting back to the full gathering their group's conclusions.

Each of the three days kicked off with a more formal presentation of ideas and concepts spurred by the theme. Neil on the first morning spoke about the concept of pattern on different levels as a conceptual framework to view our Paradise ascent. On Sunday morning, Ann Bendall gave a presentation on ego, and on the final morning, Ken Glasziou gave a summary of how the Master himself refined his contact with his thought adjuster (not a bad role model, eh?) The two last talks are covered elsewhere in this edition.

I want to take the concept one step further, and, as is my wont, a purely practical step.

More effective communication with our thought adjusters equates to more effective striving to do the will of the Father. How did Jesus do this, in practical terms?

> “_There was so little of the professional, the well-planned, or the pre-meditated in the Master's earthly ministry. He dispensed health and scattered happiness naturally and gracefully as he journeyed through life. It was literally true, ‘He went about doing good’_”. ([UB 171:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/171#p7_9))

One of his assets, however, was that he was so tuned into “_...what was in the heart and mind of man...expert in the comprehension of human need, clever in detecting human longings_”. People sensed this at a glance and were drawn to him and often asked him questions which gave him the starting point to reveal his truth.

We don't have such an asset, or at least I don't going by my own personal experience. So if we assume we won't be bombarded with questions, perhaps one way of getting in touch with our fellow child of God is to learn how to take the first step.

How did Jesus do it? I can only find four times that the Master encountered any of his children and had to step in: The young man who was afraid (1437); the wife basher, while embarking at Tarentum (1470); Flavius, the art-conscious Greek Jew (1600); and the woman of Sychar — at Jacob's well.

I've mixed clues for these four encounters together with my own experience to come up with some thoughts on a suggested ‘how-to’ guide for us.

#### Ask Questions

Cultivate your genuine interest in the person by getting to where they are at. Ask questions that are openended. That means ones that invite an opinion or explanation, rather than a yes/no answer. Questions starting with ‘how?’, ‘why?’, ‘in what way?’ are better than ‘do you?’ or ‘is it?’ questions. Statements like ‘tell me more about...’ achieve the same effect as an open-ended question. Keep trying. Even the Master's opening gambit with the young man who was afraid, in effect asking if he could help the lad, didn't work. Look at Jesus' second attempt:

> “_I understand you come up to these hills to get away from folks; so, of course, you do not want to talk with me, but I would like to know whether you are familiar with these hills; do you know the direction of these trails?_” ([UB 130:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p6_2))

I guess it's hard to communicate with someone unless you get them talking!

#### Listen

To ask the right questions, we have to be good listeners. There are two types of listening — passive and active. Passive is like being a sponge where the communication is essentially one way. Active listening also involves asking questions based on what has just been said to either reinforce or enlarge your understanding, of where they're at rather than where you want them to be. Jesus was far more interested in Flavius's soul than his art collection, and yet...

> “_... Flavius was agreeably surprised when Jesus entered the home that, instead of [Jesus] rebuking him for having these supposedly idolatrous objects scattered around the house, he manifested great interest in the entire collection and asked many appreciative questions about each object as Flavius escorted him from room to room, showing him all of his favourite statues._” ([UB 142:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/142#p4_1))

And what an opening line with the woman at Jacob's well — “Give me a drink”. She was a Samaritan and Jews didn't converse with Samaritans, let alone men speaking to women at wells. He knew this would get her going and it did. He got there in four words.

While embarking at Tarentum, his first question to the enraged man beating his wife was in the vein of damage control (“My friend, may I speak with you in private for a moment?”), He then asks three more questions, although the book doesn't say what the man's answers were to the questions.

#### Build/Embellish

Jesus made extensive use of metaphor and analogy and in particular, when used in parables. With the young man, he used metaphors about “the service trails and happiness highways”; with the woman at the well in terms of the metaphor of well water versus spiritual water. (See pages 1688-1694 for an excellent summary of the use of parables.)

In his six months Rome sojourn with the thirty-two religious leaders...

> “_...never once did he [Jesus] attack their errors or even mention the flaws in their teachings In each case he would select the truth in what they taught and then proceed so to embellish and illuminate this truth in their minds so that in a very short time this enhancement of the truth effectively crowded out the associated error..._” ([UB 132:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/132#p0_4))


### The Risks Of Life

**This is a poem which Terry Hovaghimlan read out at the Conference.**

To laugh is to risk appearing a fool.
To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.
To reach out is to risk involvement.
To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self.
To place your ideals and dreams before a crowd 
is to risk their love.
To love is to risk not to be loved in return.
To live is to risk dying.
To hope is to risk despair.
To try is to risk failure.
But the greatest hazard in life is to risk nothing.
For the one who risks nothing, does nothing, 
has nothing and finally is nothing,
He may avoid suffering and sorrow, but he simply 
cannot learn, feel, grow or love.
Charged with this certitude he is a slave.
For he has forfeited freedom.
For only the one who risks is free.

### Ego

_Ann Bendall, Nambour, Qld_

Ego is a fascinating, heavily value-laden word in our culture. It is scen as a bad thing, a positively unhealthy thing, a thing to be stifled and suppressed. It has come to be identified with egotist (a conceited, boastful person; a self-interested person), rather than ego (one's image of oneself).

In Western society, in particular, there are some decidedly unhealthy social rules which cause a lot folks to be labelled egotists. First of all we are to be winners. At the same time as being winners, we are not allowed to congratulate ourselves, for then we are boastful and have a bad ego. So we are to be smug in our egos, say: “Oh it really wasn't that good” (when perhaps our Thought Adjuster regards it as positively brilliant work on its part) or say: “It was only luck”. Then everyone is happy. Those who regard themselves as failures do not have to feel that there might be something they could ask the winner about, or perhaps learn from, some belief that they might find benefit in discarding. And so continues stagnation of the social unit, plus heaps of self-deception. If pressure is placed too heavily on the winner to be self-effacing, for fear of being accused of self importance, there is a possibility of another screwed up ego in the making.

Is ego bad? _The URANTIA Book_ appears to me to use the word ‘ego’ as simply one's image of oneself (Oxford Dictionary). It sees the ego as something we are always going to have, and I can appreciate this, for this is my self concept, my view of my selfhood. And so, eradicating from my mental dictionary the definition of ego as egotist, I can proceed to learn about what ego really is. The revelators can tell me. Now my ego is normal, natural and is going to be around for eternity. For a long, long time it might bear a very vague resembance to truth, whilst I try to turn the universe upside down to fit in with my concept of self, and the universe desperately tries to enlighten me as to the reality of me — to get my selfhood and my ego looking the same. One of the dangerous ways I can wander along the pathway to illusion, is if I indulge in egotism — an inflated sense of self-importance (one of poor Judas's problems). God will be fully aware of this state, and if I carefully examine my motives, so will I be.

My ego is with me from well before my Thought Adjuster arrives. Very early in life I have developed ego into egotist, this “_strong and well-unified egoistic nature_”. ([UB 103:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_9)) Thanks to Our Father, I developed this because of his gift of personality. Thanks also to His gift of personality, very early in life the normal child begins to learn that it is “_more blessed to give than to receive_” ([UB 103:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_9)) and as a result of my first moral decision, my Thought Adjuster arrives.

Then the fun begins for my ego (which has become less egotistic), as my well-intentioned, but often misdirected, socializers introduce me to the cultural rules so that I become a good social animal, and I adopt practices which win the applause of those around, but deeply disturb my innate moral sense. And so I pander to their ego to ensure that my ego stays nice and unruffled. And in the midst of this melee is my Thought Adjuster trying to get through the concept of altruism ([UB 103:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_7)).

If this concept comes through in the midst of a social environment which indoctrinates me to believe that my role in life is to ensure others' pleasure, then there is a big problem. My ego sclf concept says there should be no ‘me’ in my life:

> “_...the growing child fails of personality unification, the altruistic drive may become so overdeveloped as to work serious injury to the welfare of the self. A misguided conscience can become responsible for much conflict, worry, sorrow, and no end of human unhappiness._” ([UB 103:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_10))

(That is, my ego is not egotistic enough.) From personal experience I could tell some interesting stories on the hard work that has to be done by a Thought Adjuster in this most unfortunate circumstance. But this story is about a more balanced ego which, rightfully and healthily, recognizes that the personality given to us by God is so that we can grow to be well balanced little God-kids.

Out into the world I go desiring to be moral and altruistic, and my dear ego gets worried by the problems I confront in trying to ensure the greatest good for me and others, and my...

> “_...interpretation of these early conflicts between the ego-will and the other-than-self will is not always dependable. Only a fairly well unified personality can arbitrate the multiform contentions of the ego cravings and the budding social consciousness. The self has rights as well as one's neighbors. Neither has exclusive claims upon the attention and service of the individual. Failure to resolve this problem gives origin to the earliest type of human guilt feelings._” ([UB 103:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_4))

Not having a well-unified personality, I know a good deal about guilt also, and it is a relief to discover that this guilt is all very natural and normal for a growing God kid to feel:

> “_Every human being very early experiences something of a conflict between his self-seeking and his altruistic impulses, and many times the first experience of God-consciousness may be attained as the result of seeking for superhuman help in the task of resolving such moral conflicts._” ([UB 103:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p2_4))

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia" alt="udnerstand">
<img src="/image/article/606/understand.jpg">
</figure>

Be that as it may:

> “_Human happiness is achieved only when the ego desire of the self and the altruistic urge of the higher self (divine spirit) are co-ordinated and reconciled by the unified will of the integrating and supervising personality. The mind of evolutionary man is ever confronted with the intricate problem of refereeing the contest between the natural expansion of emotional impulses and the moral growth of unselfish urges predicated on spiritual insight--genuine religious reflection._” ([UB 103:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p5_5))

And so I battle onwards striving to reach this wondrous state of human happiness, knowing that when I reach it I will not have a clue as to how I found it. Not to worry, my Thought Adjuster has had a long, hard path to traverse, and fully knows, the way. And I am darned sure, I don't want to retrace my steps. I do so want a healthy ego, one which reduces “_the conflict of the self-seeking ego with the altruistic urge of the indwelling spirit Monitor._” ([UB 103:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/103#p4_1))

Now an interesting thing I discovered (one of billions), is that I am regarded as being made up of different egos — a praying one, an alter one, a religious one and a self one, probably an effective way of separating the potential wheat from the chaff.

The religious ego can be a problem. This is the one that can potentially get me into a self image as a Divine Messenger (with capitals) if I get too carried away. The secret to keep this religious ego in balance, if I feel I am a ‘religious genius’ is, you guessed it — model Jesus!

> “_He was not unfavorably affected in his practical life by his extraordinary faith and spirit attainment because this spiritual exaltation was a wholly unconscious and spontaneous soul expression of his personal experience with God._” ([UB 196:0.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_6))

So if I think I am a religious genius there is a good chance that I am not, particularly if I also feel my calling is to “save the world”.

The praying ego is a nice ego:

> “_Prayer has always indicated positive action by the praying ego; it has been always psychic and sometimes spiritual._” ([UB 91:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p2_2))

I must do some different praying other than “God give me strength”, or “Look, could you fix up everyone around me so my life can be easier?” I suspect that I have a lot to learn from Jesus on praying. (There is a fabulous account of how Jesus prayed on page [UB 196:0.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_10).)

And then there is the alter ego. This is another nice ego, highly recommended for praying:

> “_Enlightened prayer must recognize not only an external and personal God but also an internal and impersonal Divinity, the indwelling Adjuster. It is altogether fitting that man, when he prays, should strive to grasp the concept of the Universal Father on Paradise; but the more effective technique for most practical purposes will be to revert to the concept of a near-by alter ego, just as the primitive mind was wont to do, and then to recognize that the idea of this alter ego has evolved from a mere fiction to the truth of God's indwelling mortal man in the factual presence of the Adjuster so that man can talk face to face, as it were, with a real and genuine and divine aller ego that indwells him and is the very presence and essence of the living God, the Universal Father._” ([UB 91:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p3_7))

And if you can incorporate into your praying a little worship this:

> “_...transcends all other such practices since it leads to the cultivation of divine ideals. As the concept of the alter ego of prayer becomes supreme and divine, so are man's ideals accordingly elevated from mere human toward supernal and divine levels, and the result of all such praying is the enhancement of human character and the profound unification of human personality._” ([UB 91:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p5_1))

I believe that the most effective technique to ensure that my ego does not become egotistic in appearance, is to remember that God is personally present inside me. Let the world hail me as it chooses, altruistic, an ego maniac or anywhere in between. I know exactly what I am — a dear little God-child trying so honestly to grow, whilst recognizing fully my animal heritage. If I am seen as good, or feel good, I have no doubt where the credit lies — to God. To my self-concept, my ego, this causes no concern of credit wrongly placed. For God and I are an inseparable partnership.

My pure desire is to have God and me so close that we think, feel and are alike. One day, I know, thanks to God, I will reach this state of unbroken awareness. So if I have a silly, non-reality based thought like how truly smart and good and brilliant I am for having followed my Thought Adjuster's advice so brilliantly (i.e. magnifying my self importance):

> “_...if we stop to contemplate the infinity of the greatness and grandeur of our Makers, our own self-glorification becomes sublimely ridiculous, even verging on the humorous. One of the functions of humor is to help all of us take ourselves less serious1y. Humor is the divine antidote for exaltation of ego._” ([UB 48:4.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p4_15))

### What Jesus Did

_Ken Glasziou, Maleny_

_(All emphases within quotes from _The URANTIA Book_ have been added.)_

Let's start this quest for knowledge with first examining what Jesus was supposed to do, before we go on to consider what he actually did do, and how that affects us. We can find out what Jesus was supposed to do by referring to the beginning of Part 4 of _The URANTIA Book_.

> “_Michael had a double purpose in coming to our planet as Jesus of Nazareth. First, he was completing the required bestowal experiences...demanded of all Creator Sons before they can assume complete sovereignty of their created universe.... Second, he was aspiring to the privilege of representing the maximum authority of the Paradise Trinity that can be exercised in the direct and personal administration of a local universe._” ([UB 120:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p0_4))

In other words Michael was undertaking this mission in order to qualify as a Master Creator Son. Of importance to us humans is how these aims were to be achieved. To discover that, we have to go to the bestowal charge of Immanuel, the ambassador of the Paradise Trinity assigned to our universe of Nebadon, which included this statement:

> “_Throughout your Urantia career you need be concerned with ***but one thing, the unbroken communion between you and your Paradise Father***; and it will be by the perfection of such a relationship that the world of your bestowal... will behold a new and more understandable revelation of your Father and my Father, the Universal Father of all._” ([UB 120:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p1_4))

It appears that Immanuel and Michael had spent some time in considering the what, how, and why of the bestowal, for Immanuel went on to say:

> “_Your great mission to be realized and experienced in the mortal incarnation is embraced ***in your decision*** to live a life wholeheartedly motivated to do the will of your Paradise Father, thus to ***reveal God***, your Father, in the flesh and especially ***to the creatures of the flesh***._” [UB 120:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_8)

Immanuel then asked Jesus to:

> “_...exhibit in your one short life in the flesh, as it has never been seen in all Nebadon, the transcendent possibilities ***attainable by a God-knowing human*** during the short career of human existence..._” ([UB 120:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_8))

...and to show to the entire universe..

> “_...the achievement of God seeking man and finding him and the phenomenon of man seeking God and finding him..._” ([UB 120:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/120#p2_8))

The commission tells us that the example set by Jesus during that part of his mission before he became fully aware of his dual nature exemplifies a life that is attainable by you and me. Only in the later stages of his bestowal life was Jesus actually living a dual role — both a full human being as well as a Creator Son of God. In actuality, he had fully completed all that had been asked of him when, in his thirty-first year, he descended from a forty day sojourn on Mount Hermon just prior to his baptism. At this point he could have left Urantia to assume his universe title and status as a Master Creator Son. The subsequent teaching mission with the disciples that terminated in his death and resurrection were not a requisite part of the bestowal. For that part, Jesus was purely a volunteer. But even in this second stage in which he recognized his own true status as both God and man, for the most part, his life was still both a revelation of the personality of God and an example to us of what is attainable by human beings.

I want to digress here and refer to some statements towards the end of Part 4. Much of what we know about what Jesus did has always been considered as something that he could do only because of his dual status as man and God. Most Christians have concluded that ‘in real life’ many of the attitudes taken by Jesus are unrealistic and impractical and not what is required from us. Let's have it firmly in our minds that _The URANTIA Book_ says otherwise, it really does tell us that the example of the man Jesus is attainable by God-knowing and God-seeking individuals! So what restrains us? The book has this to say to men and women of our times:

> “_Modern, civilized men dread the thought of falling under the dominance of strong religious convictions. Thinking man has always feared to be held by a religion. When a strong and moving religion threatens to dominate him, he invariably tries to rationalize, traditionalize, and institutionalize it, thereby hoping to gain control of it. By such procedure, even a revealed religion becomes man-made and man-dominated. Modem men and women of intelligence evade the religion of Jesus because of their fears of what it will do to them--and with them. And all such fears are well founded. The religion of Jesus does, indeed, dominate and transform its believers, demanding that men dedicate their lives to seeking for a knowledge of the will of the Father in heaven and requiring that the energies of living be consecrated to the unselfish service of the brotherhood of man._” ([UB 195:9.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_6))

Then follows this sentence:

> “_Selfish men and women simply will not pay such a price for even the greatest spiritual treasure ever offered mortal man._” [UB 195:9.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_7)

In that extremely brief review, we have covered the primary requirements of what was expected for Jesus' bestowal life. Next we want to cover some of the ways in which these aims were achieved. Firstly let's take a look at attitudes that he adopted:

> “_Jesus had great difficulty in getting them [the apostles] to understand his personal practice of ***non-resistance***. He absolutely ***refused to defend himself***, and it appeared to the apostles that he would be pleased if they would pursue the same policy. He taught them ***not to resist evil, not to combat injustice or injury, but he did not teach passive tolerance of wrongdoing***. And he made it plain on this afternoon that he approved of the social punishment of evildoers and criminals, and that the civil government must sometimes employ force for the maintenance of social order and in the execution of justice._”
> 
> “_He never ceased to warn his disciples against ***the evil practice of retaliation***; he made ***no allowance for revenge, the idea of getting even***. He deplored the ***holding of grudges***. He disallowed the idea of an ***eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth***. He discountenanced the whole concept of ***private and personal revenge***, assigning these matters to civil government, on the one hand, and to the judgment of God, on the other. He made it clear... that his teachings ***applied to the individual***, not the state. He summarized his instructions up to that lime regarding these matters, as:_”
> 
> “***Love your enemies*** _—remember the moral claims of human brotherhood._”
> 
> “_***The futility of evil***: A wrong is not righted by vengeance. Do not make the mistake of fighting evil with its own weapons._”
> 
> “***Have faith*** —_confidence in the eventual triumph of divine justice and eternal goodness._” [UB 140:8.4-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p8_4)

If we could do all of that, there would not be much room left over for inter-personal or even international conflict. But Jesus did not indicate that his followers should be passive martyrs, enduring all indignities inflicted upon them:

> “_Jesus did not advocate the practice of negative submission to the indignities of those who might purposely seek to impose upon the practitioners of non-resistance to evil, but rather that his followers should be wise and alert in the quick and positive reaction of good to evil to the end that they might effectively ***overcome evil with good. Forget not, the truly good is invariably more powerful than the most malignant evil***. The Master taught a positive standard of righteousness: ‘Whosoever wishes to be my disciple, ***let him disregard himself*** and take up the full measure of his responsibilities daily to follow me’. And he so lived himself in that ‘***he went about doing good***.’_” ([UB 159:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/159#p5_10))

We might feel that all this is well beyond us, that Jesus could do these things because he was special. Indeed he was special, but apparently not in the way that he had physical or mental attributes that we ordinary mortals do not possess. There was nothing extraordinary about his parents, or his ancestry, they were just good, average, Jewish stock. The mind and body of the human Jesus was no different from our own. It could not have been genetically exceptional, nor supernaturally endowed, if he was to fulfil his mission of living a life that is attainable by ordinary mortals. So our real problem in not being able to emulate Jesus is that we somehow fail to develop attributes we really do possess.

If this is a correct hypothesis, then there must have been something unusual that the human Jesus did that enabled him to reach such an extraordinary level of spiritual development — a level that certainly would have permitted him to fuse with his Thought Adjuster by the age of thirty-one, and perhaps long before that. It can only be a guess, but I would suggest that the habit he established during very early childhood of talking to God as a normal child would talk to a loving parent, may have been the means that allowed him to forge an extraordinary link with his Thought Adjuster, and it was this linkage that permitted his remarkable, accelerated spiritual development.

By the age of six, when he was by himself, Jesus was already addressing his Father-God as ‘Abba’, meaning ‘Papa’, and speaking to God in just the same way as he spoke to Joseph — much to the consternation of both his parents. This appears to be the only really unusual thing about the childhood of Jesus. However, it would have represented a ‘culture shock’ to most Jewish families whose God, Yahweh, had caused the slaughter of thousands of the first-born of the Egyptians, wiped out whole populations in the promised land, and punished his chosen people for their waywardness with the cruel captivity in Babylon.

Whatever the reason for Jesus' exceptional spiritual development, we cannot go back to our childhood to do as he did. So is there another way? The book indicates that there is. In Part 2, it reminds us that...

> “_...in every mortal, there exists a dual nature: the inheritance of animal tendencies and the higher urge of spirit endowment._” ([UB 34:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_9))

We Urantians suffer from the consequences of a double deprivation due to the Caligastia rebellion and the Adamic default, because of which we are crippled by an inherent nature that does not naturally bear the fruits of the spirit. Such is our state that...

> “_...the dead theory of even the highest religious doctrines ***is powerless to transform us***. What the world needs today is the truth that your teacher of old declared, ‘Not in the word only but also in power and in the Holy Spirit’._” ([UB 34:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_6))

The highest religious doctrine is powerless to transform us!! _The URANTIA Book_ is the highest religious doctrine available on this planet, and it tells us that, by itself, it is powerless to transform us! To transform ourselves, we must embrace the spirit powers provided to us, but even then:

> “_...it is not enough that this spirit be poured out upon you, the divine Spirit must dominate and control every phase of human experience._” ([UB 34:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_7))

This is the area in which we Urantians have been a failure over the last two thousand years. Few indeed have allowed the divine Spirit to dominate and control every phase of their experience, and that despite the revelations of many holy men and women, the revelation of Jesus 2000 years ago, and also despite the new revelation of _The URANTIA Book_.

It is worth taking a few moments to reflect on a fact told us in the book. Prior to the coming of Jesus, human beings were not universally indwelt by their Thought Adjusters immediately following their first moral decision. In fact, the requirements for such indwelling were quite rigorous, and most of us can be eternally thankful that we came into this world after, and not before, the bestowal of Jesus brought us the outpouring of his Spirit of Truth (see [UB 108:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/108#p2_3)).

The fourth and fifth epochal revelations have prepared us for Adjuster indwelling in two ways. The book tells us:

> “_Jesus showed mankind ***the new way of mortal living*** whereby human beings may very largely escape the dire consequences of the Caligastia rebellion and most effectively compensate for the deprivations resulting from the Adamic default. ***The spirit of the life of Christ Jesus has made us free*** from the law of animal living._” ([UB 34:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_6))

First, Jesus showed us a new way, and then he made his Spirit of Truth available to us. The enormous transforming power of that gift of the spirit is illustrated by what happened to the apostles:

> “_***in less than a month*** after the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth, the apostles made more individual progress than during their ***almost four years*** of personal and loving association with the Master._” ([UB 194:2.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_9))

That is power indeed — and it is available to all of us, just for the asking. The book tells us...

> “_...the spirit never creates a consciousness of himself, only a consciousness of Michael, the Son. The proof, therefore, of your fellowship with the Spirit of Truth is not to be found in the consciousness of this spirit but rather in your experience of enhanced fellowship with Michael._” ([UB 194:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_4))

Since we have been told that “_all spirit influences are one in function_”([UB 34:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_2)), it is not hard to put two and two together to arrive at the conclusion that we genetically and spiritually deficient Urantians have been given a very special pathway to compensate for our disadvantages by means of a virtually miraculous transformation that can bring us into much closer communion with our Thought Adjusters. That pathway is through Jesus and his Spirit of Truth.

The book says: “_***Of all human knowledge, that which is of greatest value is to know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it***._” ([UB 196:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_3)) It is a fact that a phrase such as “doing the will of God”, is empty of real meaning to many Urantians. Neither does the idea of communicating or cooperating with our Thought Adjuster convey anything concrete. How do we achieve these things? If we know the religious life of Jesus and how he lived it, we can substitute real ideas, real concepts, and real images for what otherwise might be nebulous, abstract, or unreal.

The life and teachings of Jesus revealed to us in _The URANTIA Book_ is the vital knowledge that can provide us with the means of really knowing the mind of Jesus. In turn, knowing the mind of Jesus enables the Spirit of Truth to make us more and more conscious of Jesus, which, in its turn, enables our superconscious awareness to be in much closer communication with the guiding hand of our Thought Adjuster. Knowing the mind of Jesus provides us with another real advantage. In any situation confronting us, we can ask ourselves: “Now what would Jesus do?” — and seek the answer both from our stored memories of what Jesus taught or did in similar circumstances, as well as by seeking guidance from the spirit forces within. In this way, we backward and disadvantaged Urantians have been endowed with a transforming power by which we can overcome the greatest handicap to our spiritual growth, our innate, inherent, genetic inability to communicate adequately with our Thought Adjusters. The book tells us:

> “_To the children of a local universe a Michael Son is, to all practical intents and purposes, God. He is the local universe personification of the Universal Father and the Eternal Son._” ([UB 5:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p3_6))

It also tells us that all spirit forces are one in function. Hence to focus our minds upon Jesus, who becomes more and more real to us as we familiarize ourselves with his life and teachings, is both a valid and a realistic way of spiritualizing and transforming our minds and souls, and making the spiritual power of the Thought Adjuster effective in our lives.

Getting down to some practical details of what Jesus did during his bestowal mission, possibly that which was of most significance was the changes he made to the second most important of the Hebrew commandments. The first of these was to love God with all your heart and soul; the second, to love your neighbour as yourself. Jesus changed the second one when he commanded his disciples to “_love one another as I have loved you_”. That change elevated a concept that could be interpreted in purely material terms to one which must be interpreted virtually exclusively at a spiritual level.

So our next task will be to try to discover what Jesus meant by his injunction to love one another as he, representing God, loved us. But since the reality of loving our neighbour is such a complex thing, we can only hope to do this inadequately and in part. We must really know the mind of Jesus in order to fully understand what Jesus meant by loving as he loved us. The book tells us:

> “_***Love, unselfishness***, must undergo a constant and living readaptative interpretation of relationships in accordance with the leading of ***the Spirit of Truth***. Love must thereby grasp the ever-changing and enlarging concepts of the ***highest cosmic good*** of the individual who is loved._” ([UB 180:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p5_10))

Let us not miss these several important facts. It is the Spirit of Truth that does the leading. Note, too, that love and unselfishness (selflessness) are equated. Last but not least, to love another, we need to want for them not whatever appears best for the present moment, nor even whatever might seem best for their life on this planet. To love our neighbour, we have to want for that person their highest cosmic good, their highest eternal good. Only God can know that. God's knowledge is not limited by the dimension of time. The human Jesus could achieve such love because he had fully complied with Immanuel's injunction to “_be concerned with but one thing, the unbroken communion between you and your Paradise Father_”. Thus the time factor was overcome. To love as Jesus loved us, we too, must cultivate unbroken communion with the spirit forces available to us, which I believe, for us Urantians, means through Jesus and the Spirit of Truth. Only Spirit can transcend time and guide us into love-action that can result in the “highest cosmic good” for the one who is loved.

Both the fourth and the fifth epochal revelations emphasized that we have to ‘be’ before we can ‘do’. In describing events of the night following the ordination of the twelve apostles, _The URANTIA Book_ says:

> “_That evening...Jesus talked at great length, trying to show the twelve ***what they must be, not what they must do***. They knew only a religion that imposed the doing of certain things as the means of attaining righteousness-salvation. But Jesus would reiterate, ‘In the kingdom ***you must be righteous in order to do the work***’. Many times did he repeat: ‘***Be you therefore perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect***’_”. ([UB 140:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p10_1))

When Jesus asked us to be perfect as the Father in heaven is perfect, he was asking that this should be our sincere goal. Even after our mansion world career, we will still have more than a billion years of earth time in front of us before we can stand perfected in the presence of the Father. The book tells us:

> “_What you are today is not so important as what you are becoming day by day and in eternity._” ([UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5))

Unless we are utterly sincere about what we are becoming day by day, ultimately we will betray ourselves, we will be seen not to be sincere, and we will be a hindrance rather than a help to the neighbour we are supposed to love.

Perhaps one of the greatest problems we have in being what we ought to be, is that very human characteristic of resentment. What do we feel when a brother or sister appears to throw our love back in our face? If anger and resentment are our response, then we have no hope of letting our love help to light a path for that person. If we are going to ‘be’ before we can ‘do’, the one essential is that we will have already offered our will back to God unconditionally, for unless we embrace and utilize the spirit power available to us, failure is virtually inevitable. Jesus once said: “_Greater love hath no man than this, that he offer his life for a friend_”. God already owns our life. Hence, the only possible gift we can make to God that is of true value to our Paradise Father is the consecration of our will to him. The book informs us:

> “_The affectionate dedication of the human will to the doing of the Father's will is man's choicest gift to God; in fact, such a consecration of creature will constitutes ***man's only possible gift of true value*** to the Paradise Father. In God, man lives, moves, and has his being; there is nothing which man can give to God except this choosing to abide by the Father's will..._” ([UB 1:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p1_2))

Strangely enough, it is only when we so consecrate our wills that we are finally blessed with true freedom. Maybe that needs explanation. To Ganid, Jesus said:

> “_Ganid, I have absolute confidence in my heavenly Father's overcare; I am consecrated to doing the will of my Father in heaven. I do not believe that real harm can befall me; I do not believe that my lifework can really be jeopardized by anything my enemies might wish to visit upon me, and surely we have no violence to fear from our friends. I am absolutely assured that the entire universe is friendly to me—***this all powerful truth I insist on believing*** with a wholehearted trust ***in spite of all appearances to the contrary***._” ([UB 133:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/133#p1_4))

Now that might seem to be totally unrealistic — like the proverbial ostrich burying its head in the sand at the first sight of danger — but we need to remember that, within a hundred years, Jesus' teaching had turned the mighty Roman Empire upside down. The revelators choose their words very carefully. When they say, “_this all powerful truth” and “in spite of all appearances to the contrary_”, that is exactly what is meant.

The human Jesus had consecrated his will to the Father, in whom he had placed total faith. Thus he could take a time-transcending, cosmic viewpoint, even though, being human, he may not have fully understood a particular situation. Therefore, antipathy or antagonism or whatever apparently adverse reactions were being displayed towards him or around him, Jesus could see them as being in God's hands, a God whom he could trust to ultimately bring good out of apparent evil. And having such trust, the result of offering his will back to God, Jesus was free of those emotional responses by which we lesser beings mess things up — rather than functioning to optimize the good that could be drawn from the situation.

If slogans can help, then perhaps “to let go, and to let God” may be a useful peg to stimulate our memories.

I doubt that there is any other way for we humans to become free from destructive self-centredness, anger and resentment, other than giving our wills, our minds, and our lives totally over to God, and having done so, trusting that whatever happens is in his hands. For that, surely, is exactly what Jesus did in following Immanuel's injunction to exhibit in his short life in the flesh, the transcendent possibilities attainable by a God-knowing human.

Suppressing our emotional responses is only a temporary measure, and often leads to a worse result at a future time. Having faith that God knows what he is doing, and that he can and will utilize all apparently adverse circumstances to generate the maximum cosmic good for all concerned appears to be the way to personal freedom. Letting go and letting God is one way, and perhaps the only way, to rid ourselves of those human emotions that tend to wreck personal relationships. And if we err, as we inevitably will, we can be assured that God can use that too.

However, we have to remember that we cannot use our trust and faith in God as simply a means of selfdefence, or self-isolation amounting to a ‘cop-out’ — that would be self-serving, not neighbour-serving, hence contrary to the will of God. If we can find one, we must actively and aggressively seek the positive pathway, which is not a passive tolerance of wrong doing, but the taking of any conceivable action that might assist to overcome evil with good.

Just to get our thoughts back on track, let's remind ourselves that we are trying to discover how we can love one another as Jesus loves us. Another problem with our human concept of love is that it invariably has an element of self-gain — ranging from something as crude as you-pat-my-back-and-I'll-pat-yours — to the much more subtle motive of doing something to ensure that God accepts us as candidates for eternal life. But God always knows our motives — he can neither be fooled nor bribed.

Since God's love for us is selfless, a human love that reflects God's love must also be selfless and concerned only for the highest cosmic good of the one who is loved — regardless of consequences to ourselves. God gives his love even to those who return nothing. God's love is truly unconditional. Somehow or other, we have to become freed from even the unconscious notion that the recipient of our love is under an obligation to be grateful to us, or to repay us. This very human expectation is a major source, if not the major source, of much human conflict and misery.

When Jesus saw friendliness where others would observe only ingratitude, injustice, or hostility, the human Jesus was taking a cosmic overview in deference to the superior wisdom and knowledge of God. Through his superconscious mind, and his Thought Adjuster, he could strike an attitude liberated from the restrictions and emotions of the moment, an attitude serving the eternal good.

Jesus served as he passed by, he never followed up on such actions, and he never placed people under obligation excepting if they elected, of their own free will, to represent him in the world as he represented the Father. When God gives us his love, the only thing of any possible value that we can return in gratitude for his gift is our will.

Hence when we love another as Jesus loves us, we are trying to love as God loves, and the only valid hope we can have is that the recipient of that love may recognize that its true source is not ourselves, but God. Hence it is to God, and not us, that they owe their gratitude. The value to us is that, as we participate in the reality of God's love, we become freed from the tyranny of resentment and hurt. The reason? They owe us nothing at all — the love was not ours to give:

> “_All true love is from God, and man receives the divine affection as he himself bestows this love upon his fellows. Love is dynamic. It can never be captured; it is alive, free, thrilling, and always moving. Man can never take the love of the Father and imprison it within his hear. The Father's love can become real to mortal man only by passing through that man's personality as he in turrn bestows this love upon his fellows._” ([UB 117:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_10))

So if it happened that recipients of our love were, by chance, of equivalent spiritual status to some of those savage human beings at the dawn of mankind's history, and the return to us was to be eaten for their dinner, then so be it. After all, consider what a highly civilized people did to Jesus — and his response was: “_Forgive them Father for they know not what they do_”.

Bill Sadler used to say to always keep your hopes high and your expectations low, for if you let them tend to become equal, you are in for one very rough time. We really need to set our expectations, in terms of personal return from the recipient to ourselves, at absolute zero level. Anything else contains an element of selfishness, hence our good works will have no spiritual value, and will count for nothing.

Perhaps that sounds a bit extreme but it is the truth. When we offer ourselves and our will to God, loyalty and service to God becomes our religion, and there can be no half measures. The book tells us:

> “_To isolate part of life and call it religion is to disintegrate life and to distort religion. And this is just why the God of worship claims all allegiance or none._” ([UB 102:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p6_1))

Jesus death on the cross was the ultimate test, and the ultimate proof of his total allegiance to God. And besides that, it was the ultimate example for us.

## On Reflection

### A Quick Trip To Paradise

_Neil Francey, Brisbane_

The 1993 Australian Conference for readers of _The URANTIA Book_ was indeed a journey to the shores of paradise. And it was entirely created by the participants.

The presentations, the humour, the talent and the fellowship were all generated by ourselves. It is amazing how so much can be contributed when UB friends get together. Rewards were derived by all but particularly newer readers who take in lots of ideas in a short time.

In Australia, conferences have had the tendency to inject an impetus into a readership area. It has assisted in generating interest and securing readership commitment. It should be noted that this refers to quality and not quantity.

It is also fair to say that as well as the relaxation and fun, there is a recognition of the responsibility — to ourselves and others. We are having a say in the evolutionary direction of Michael's own planet.

We are setting a pattern, an arrangement of energies. It is a contribution in some small way helping progress this planet towards settling in Light and Life, which will be a resemblance, a shadow, to the Elcrnal Paradise, the ausolute of patterns.

The articles in this issue of Six-O Six give an indication of the scholarship and merit of the conference presentations. The recurring theme in presentations was the need for prayer, to take action in faith and to use the idea of Jesus as our guide. I'm sure we gained a quiet confidence and an inner peace as a result of our journey. May we continue our journey together.
