## Going International

Given the current rate of growth in book sales in Australia, it is reasonable to expect this increase world wide in English and French speaking countries. It is difficult to forecast a likely altemative. Numbers will demand signilicant measures to maintain the personal nature of URANTIA Book work.

With numbers comes public attention, and our international status will depend upon our commitment to Jesus' teachings.

In these early days it has been possible to establish a readership family! In the years to come an integral part of our work will be to extend this family to more distant shores. If we can achieve this, our ties will strengthen, not weaken. This bond will shine out singularly in the midst of all differences, against all the odds. There are good reasons to believe this can be accomplished. Apart from the Master's assurances, active communication programs will create goodwill, give purpose and discipline to lives, break dow social, economic and age barriers, inform our concerned younger generation, and provide skilled teachers. An emerging world community, at the forefront of progress, will come into existence.

_The URANTIA Book_ does have international sppeal. It generates an interest in the nature of the world and the people who inhabit it. We can be aware of the general advance of civilization as we gain knowledge about our neighbours and an appreciation of their values and quality of life.

Issues of humanity, compassion, integrity, and social justice are also recognized as being relevant to the health and wedlbeing of mankind. We can realize our spiritual nature as we strive for harmonious conditions.

The primary initiative of an international organization is to co-ordinate and advise while sensitive to local issues. The infra-structure on any society will determine the assimilation of _the URANTIA Book_ teachings, and expectations for the future nature of the URANTIA movement should not be contained within too narrow a perspective.

As we require a more formal administrative structure to direct the progress of URANTIA Book outreach, we shouid consciously maintain our personal links. In this way we can draw upon the ideas and skills of dedicated people. We will not see divisions between an organizational hierarchy and a general readership.

Above all we shall see ourselves as fellow readers with a common goal and purpose.

An intermational group, comprised of individual members, must be ever resourceful in its quest to promote truth and knowledge as it plays a unique role with an independent voice in all countries of the world.

Neil Francey, Melbourne

## Zeal And Wisdom

I wish to reply to the proposers of the URANTIA Association in Australia, as a zealot interested in spreading the good news of The Revelation.

I feel that zeal in combination with wisdom is the necessary ingredient for the Revelation to progress. I cannot understand that the proposed organisation of readers would want to bar this quality. Did Jesus lack zeal, and did he refuse even the overzealous from working with him?

We all must agree that _The URANTIA Book_ Revelation is beginning its public phase of ministry, and I do agree that “good” institutions must evolve from this. The one point that I would emphasize is that we do not become overburdened by centralized structures.

As our local numbers increase, we should become less dependent on The URANTIA Brotherhood. I think it could be better for us to experience all possible pitfalls and gain a collective experiential wisdom, rather than expect an American made Brotherhood to keep us invulnerable. What I am suggesting as a proposal for Australian URANIIA Book Reader-Unity is: localized groups dedicated to Outreach Activities. At the present time I can identify local Study Groups and also the SIX-0-SIX Newsletter as being most successful at this. If one studies trends in the U.S., great progress is being made at these grass roots levels.

The Australian URANTIA Book communities should allow for making mistakes and pitfalls, from which they can grow their om experiential wisdom.

I strongly suggest that The Association let go of timidness and experiment. As The Book says: “The act is ours, the consequences God's”. ([UB 117:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_5))

## Thought for the Month

“Progress demands development of individuality; mediocrity seeks perpetuation in standardization.” [UB 48:7.29](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_29)

## Commentary On Scientific Statements In _The Urantia Book_

One of our readers in Clifton, Queensland has been collecting odds and ends concerning the scientific content of _the Urantia Book_.for many years. Ken Glasziou has done this more or less in isolation, with no access to libraries, scientific journals, and without the benefit of discussion.

He would like to invite other Urantia Book readerg with some kind of science background to join him in an effort to produce a better commentary and also to update continuously. Ken would appreciate criticism and any additions to his first effort and also would like the benefit of discussion. His expertise is in biochemistry and biology and it is a tall order for him to try and make a universal commentary.

Six-0-Six Newsletter will publish a series of Ken's articles over the next few months.

This month's subject:

## Sub-Atomic Physics

Urantia Book [UB 42:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p8_3) : The word “mesotron” is applied to an entity responsible for shuffling energy between protons and neutrons in the atomic nucleus. The word as used must refer to a family of such entities, as one which is mentioned carries electric charge between the proton and the neutron and is positively charged, whilst another involved in radioactive decay of the neutron carries negative charge. In modern theory the “mesotron” carrying charge between proton and neutron is called a meson, and itself consists of a quark and an antiquark. The existence of such an entity was highly speculative at the time of writing of _the Urantia Book_. Now (1986), it is a virtual certainty.

In discussing radioactive disintegration of the neutron, _the Urantia Book_ states that the ‘mesotron’ energy carrier itself decays to yield a mere electron and that such disintegrations are accompanied by the emission of certain small uncharged particles. No such particle:was known to exist at the time of witing of _the Urantia Book_. Modern theory has it that disintegration of the neutron via radioactive beta decay is mediated by the W boson which itself decays to yield an electron and a neutrino. The latter is a small uncharged particle which was invented by Wolfgang Pauli in 1931 to account for the missing energy when a neutron decayed to yield a proton and an electron. Pauli did this to avoid the apparent contravention of the law of conservation of mass-energy. Many physicista rejected Pauli's idea but it was taken up by Fermi who coined the name neutrino. The existence of the neutrino was not confirmed until 1956, after _the Urantia Book_ was published. The existence of the energy carrier, the W boson, was not confirmed until 1983.

On [UB 42:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p7_7) of _the Urantia Book_ it is stated that atoms with more than 100 orbital electrons are unstable, and quickly decay. In the absence of prior knowledge this would have been a fairly wild guess at the time of witing of the Book. Element 101, with 101 orbital electrons and called Mendelevium, was detected in the products of atomic fission in 1952 , and its half-life measured to be 30 minutes. Element 102 , Nobelium was detected even later and its half-life measured as about 3 seconds.

The “Ultimaton”. _The Urantia Book_ describes the transmutation of energy into units termed ultimatons which constitute the substance of all matter. On [UB 42:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_1), we read “light, heat, magnetism, chemiam, energy, and matter are in origin, nature, and destiny, one and the same thing.” This concept in present day parlance would be termed a “unified” theory, requiring that protons, neutrons, electrons, etc., being formed from the same basic unit, should be interchangeable. Present unified gauge theories suggest that quarks can change into leptons and vice versa. Quarks are the units thet form protons, neutrons, etc., and electrons belong to the group called leptons. Although still umproven, modern theory is heading towards anification, and the orderly interconversion of quarks and leptons. This interconversion does occur during the annihilation of matter such as happens when particles and their antiparticles are made to collide. Thus the collision of electrons and positrons, both of which are leptons, can give rise to quarks and antiquarks. There is nothing very orderly about such collisions, the outcome of which is dependent on the energy of collision. Presently the mutual annihilation of matter and anti-getter is thought to give rise to pure energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation, and the newly created particles emerge from the radiant energy. Perhaps this type of event is really a re-arrangement of ultimatons.

In discussing the limitations of revelation ([UB 101:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_1)), the authors of _the Urantia Book_ specifically state that the cosmology of their revelations is not inspired, that they are not at liberty to anticipate scientific discovery, that they are restricted to co-ordinating and sorting existing knowledge, and that their statements regarding the physical sciences will soon stand in need of revision in consequence of new discoveries.

During the period of witing of the Urantia Papers (30's and 40's ) many physicists were developing what was called quantum theory, a system of mathematical relationships that appeared to apply uniquely to the micro world of the atom, but was more or less irrelevent to the familiar macro world. The writers of the Urantia Papers have obviously embraced the then very tenuous and embryonic concepts of quantum theory in describing sub-atomic events. However during the 30's and $0's, quantum theory was by no means universally accepted, and, in fact, was heid in deep suspicion by Albert Einstein, the greatest physicist of all. Quantum theory is still in a state of development, but its astounding accuracy in predicting some of the parameters of nature demonstrate that it is not too far from the truth. But in the 1930-50 period it would be a very bold and rash author who would gamble the reputation and validity of his writings on such things as the existence of the neutrino or the transient reality of the carrier that shuttles energy and charge between the protons and neutrons of the atomic nucleus.

Ken Glasziou, Clifton, Qld

NEXT MONTH: Ken will discuss Planetary Atmospheres, The Earth's Moon and Novas.

## Another Study Group

The formation of study groups is one of the true indicators of the acceptance of _the Urantia Book_ teachings.

So it is pleasing to announce a new study group in Atherton, Queensland. Geoff Harpur has reported three people attend his regular meetings and others are interested and are likely to join during the year. All our good wishes to the far north.

## An Ounce Of Experience

There probably is an English proverb that means the equivalent of: ‘An ounce of experience is better than a pound of theory’, or shall we stay metric and say a gram is better than a kilo?

The whole idea for this article came to me the day a very well-meaning friend rang me and suggested that I might like to listen to a radio program about : ‘How to answer children's questions’.

But it was when she added: ‘They probably mean questions about the facts of life’, that I became rather surprised and a little annoyed. For here was a person who never had any children, suggesting that I, a mother of three sons, the eldest one 25 , was in need of listening to such a program, or that's the way I took it. I finished up thinking what an invaluable thing experience is.

And I thought about Mr. and Mrs. Yarby, who came to visit Peter's family, in Judy Blume's book: ‘Tales of a fourth grade Nothing’.

Peter's 2&frac12; year old brother ‘Fudge’, who, or so his Mother was wishful thinking, should have been safely asleep in his cot, comes in when they are up to the roast beef of their dinner, and offers Dribble to Mrs. Yarby. Dribble is Peter's pet turtle.

But Mrs. Yarby can't stand reptiles and shrieks: ‘Get that thing away from me’. Peter, who is furious with Fadge and doesn't like Mrs. Yarby calling his beloved turtle a ‘thing’, carries Fudge tenderly back to his bedroom. Then he returns back to the dinnertable, he hears Mrs.Yarby say: ‘It must be interesting to have children. We never had any ourselves.’ ‘But if we did’, Mr.Yarby tells Peter's father, ‘we'd teach them some manners. I'm a firm believer in old-fashioned good manners:’

Before I had children, I also might have held several theories about how to bring them up. A bit like mixing a chocolate cake with the instructions in the recipe book next to you. But after 25 years, there are very few theories left. Just plain, old-fashioned good experience. How could my friend even start to imagine what is locked up in a mother's heart? All the anxious moments when you silently prayed that their guardian angels hadn't dozed off on the job, while you were watching them climb a tree to pick the highest leaf, which would be presented to you with an air of great triumph.

Or the ride in the ambulance on the way to hospital after one of them had been hit by a car.

Or the time you sat in the police station when they had got themselves into a spot of trouble and you wished that the ground would open up and swallow you, because you felt a failure as a parent.

And I also thought of the ‘would-be’ hobbyist, who keeps on going to courses, buys magazines regularly and has spent a fortune on tools, but he doesn't produce anything. He just reads and listens and admires or criticizes other people's work. And that way he can avoid having to face the real problems of the unavoidable mishaps, which are a natural part of the learning process.

It is the same in religion. “Evolutionary man does not naturally relish hard work. To keep pace in his life experience with the impelling demands and the compelling urges of a growing religious experience means incessant activity in spiritual growth, inteliectual expansion, factual enlargement, and social service. There is no real religion apart from a highly active personality. Therefore do the more indolent of men often keep to escape the rigors of truly religious activities by a species of ingerious self-deception through resorting to a retreat to the false shelter of stereotyped religious doctrines and dogmas. But true religion is alive. Intellectual crystallization of religious concepts is the equivalent of spiritual death. You cannot conceive of religion without ideas, but when religion once becomes reduced only to lan idea, it is no longer religion;it has become merely a species of human philosophy.” ([UB 102:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_7)) “True religion must act”. ([UB 102:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_8))

Although experience is indeed invaluable in our lives, no amount of experience can give us universe insight unless we have some way of evaluating it in order to recognize the meaning and feel the value of it. “There is a spirit nucleus in the mind of man — the Adjuster of the divine presence”. ([UB 196:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_6)) “... this evaluator is the child of the Center and Source of all absolute values of divine and etemal reality” ([UB 196:3.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_16)). It just depends on us how much we want to go along with this “spirit-value sorter”. He leaves the choosing to us. And as we come to accept more and more this divine leading, we have the greatest experience in human existence: God. When we find God, we have found everything. The only limitation to this experience of receiving the love of the Father is the extent of our love for our fellow men.

> “Man can never take the love of the Father and imprison it within his heart. The Father's love can cecome real to mortal man only by passing through that man's personality as he in turn bestows this love upon his fellows”. ([UB 117:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_10))

> “And when a human being does find God, there is experienced within the soul of that being such an indescribable restlessness of triumph in discovery that he is impelled to seek loving service-contact with his less illuminated fellows, not to disclose that he has found God, but rather to allow the overflow of the welling-up of eternal goodness within his ow soul to refresh and ennoble his fellows. Real religion leads to increased social service”. ([UB 102:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p3_4))

Unless the water whel gives freely of the water it has received so abundantly, it cannot keep on turning to receive more.

Likewise we have to give in order to receive. But unlike the water wheel our capacity for receiving the love of God grows the more we love our fellow human beings.

What happens to these experiences, once we have recognized their meaning and felt the quality of them? Are they here today and gone tomorrow?

Once this transaction between the human and the divine mind takes place, something new is borm. Something that has sometimes been denominated the mid mind, since it is neither material nor cosmic mind.

“This mid-mind is really a morontia phenomenon since it exists in the realm between the material and the spiritual. The potential of such a morontia evolution is inherent in the two universel urges of mind: the impulse of the finite mind of the creature to know God and attain the divinity of the Creator, and the impulse of the infinite mind of the Creator to know man and attain the experience of the creature”. ([UB 111:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_8)) This new child of the interaction between the divine and the human mind is the evolving and potentially imortal soul of man. “In so far as man's evolving morontia soul becomes permeated by truth, beauty, and goodness as the value-realization of God-consciousness, such a resultant being becomes indestructable. If there is no survival of eternal values in the evolving soul of man, then mortal existence is without meaning, and life itself is a tragic illusion. But it is forever true: What you begin in time you will assuredly finish in eternity — if it is worth finishing”. ([UB 111:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_7))

## Spirit Unity, Not Uniformity

An amazing observation I've found since reading _the Urantia Book_ is that it attracts 30 many different types. Many groups attract a certain type of person as it appeals to the way they think, but _the Urantia Book_ appeals to many whose outlook on life and ways of thinking can be entirely different.

I had a minute glimpse of what the Brotherhood of Man could be like at a study group a few months ago. One member held extremely leftist political views and another, rightist views. Both neld firmly to their viewpoints. In the environment of the study group, it became inevitable that political and social discussion arose and each found that on a number of points the other made, they strongly disagreed. Discussion became quite heated. However, both members could recognise one another as brothers in the spirit and agreed to disagree on these matters and returned to the business of stuaying _the Urantia Book_.

If we could only be open to one another in a spiritual sense, knowing that God is Father to us all and not get bogged dow in differences of opinion or personality clashes, what a wonderful world it would be.

On [UB 99:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p5_7), we read: “Just as certainly as men share their religious beliefs, they create a religious group of some sort which eventually creates common goals. Someday religionists will get together and actually effect co-operation on the basis of unity of ideals and purposes rather than attempting to do so on the basis of psychological opinions and theological beliefs. Goals rather than creeds should unify religionists”.

It's not what you are, but what you strive to be, that's important and it's not what you think, but what you are, that determines your degree of spiritual unity with your fellows.

## Map of Aussie Readers

The February Newsletter was beaut. Seeing that map and the location of the other Urantia Book readers in relation to my home tom ras very warming. A sense of brotherhood radiated from that map. I found myself wondering how the map affected everybody else, and I concluded that most of us would have felt the same way. 

Please pass on my appreciation to its originator.
