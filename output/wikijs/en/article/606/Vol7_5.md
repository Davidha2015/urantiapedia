## The Remembrance Supper

“Mind knows quantity, reality, meanings. But quality — values — is felt. That which feels is the mutual creation of mind, which knows, and the associated spirit, which reality-izes.” ([UB 111:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p3_6))

This quotation from _the URANTIA Book_ came to my mind the morning after the Remembrance Supper, which the Melbourne Study Groups held on Sunday 6 th April. Jesus estabiished the Remembrance Supper on the 6th April, 30 A.D.

Neil Francey was talking about the same thing, I think, when he said: “I felt, I could almost touch the morontia level.”

That special atmosphere of brotherhood which exists, when people come together to partake of a meal and they feel the presence of the Spirit of Truth there, is very hard to describe. It is something you don't pick up by reading a book, you have to be there to experience it. “As my Father has given me of His spirit, so will I give you of my spirit. And this Spirit of Truth which I will bestow upon you shall guide and comfort you and shall eventually lead you into all truth.” ([UB 180:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p4_2))

Out of the 22 adults and 10 children who were there that day, “no one knew quite what to expect”, as Ian Esmore put it. But I think most people went home a richer person for having experienced it.

Pamela Reynolds sang more beautiful than ever. Several people read something from _the URANTIA Book_ or Bible, or spoke their own thoughts about this special occasion. Some people contributed by bringing a tape with beautiful music and everybody brought food to share.

Joe Thackeray baked his special loaf of ryebread and his lovely wife Leslie made a delicious rice salad. Te were fortunate to have these two URANTIA Book ambassadors from the Boulder School in Colorado still with us. A week later they set off on their bikes again on the way to Adelaide. Te have heard from them since, that they have made it safely to Ayers Rock and are on their way back to Brisbane again. 

Cairns, if you see two bright eyed, energetic young people with an URANTIA Book under their arm, that's our Joe and Leslie! You are their next destination.

There was nothing ceremonial or traditonal about the Remembrance Supper. If Jesus would have established it there and then, he would have done it in our Australian setting, I'm sure. The symbols are not important, but what those symbols represent is. So whether you are breaking bread and sipping wine, or have a rice salad and drink apple juice, it makes no difference. The important thing is that we come together in his name, and that his spirit is truly present.

I like to thank all the people who were there on that occasion for helping to make it such a special day.

## Interplanetary Conference 2086 A.D. ?

This impression was flashed to Six-0-Six via the mind circuits of a young Melboume artist, Fil Barlow. Ever since the age of 14, Fil has been creating a universe of his own with different intelligent creatures unlike ourselves. He called this his “Zooniverse”. Fil thought his imagination had created a pretty vast cosmos, until he came across _the URANTIA Book_. After a friend had picked one up for $5 in a second hand bookshop and Fil started reading it, he felt completely outdone. The reality was even greater than his wildest dreams could have imagined. Fil has now joined the ranks of enthusiastic URANTIA Book readers in Melbourne and wonders if anyone would like to come and help him with his study of the book on the fourth Wednesday of the month. You will find Fil at:

Flat 2/ 2-6 Edlington St. Hawthorn, Tel. 8186970 Home, 2408021 Work.

## Thought for the Month

> “Organic evolution on the inhabited worlds is physically limited by the potentials of the original physical-life implantations of the Life Carriers.”
> 
> “Mortal man is a machine, a living mechanism; his roots are truly in the physical world of energy. Many human reactions are mechanical in nature; much of life is machinelike. But man, a mechanism, is much more than a machine; he is mind endowed and spirit indwelt; and though he can never throughout his material life escape the chemical and electrical mechanics of his existence, he can increasingly learm how to subordinate this physical-life machine to the directive wisdom of experience by the process of consecrating the human mind to the execution of the spiritual urges of the indweling Thought Adjuster.” [UB 118:8.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_1)

## Commentary on Scientific Statements in The Urantia Book, Part II

### Planetary Atmospheres

_The Urantia Book_ ([UB 49:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p2_1)) discusses varying kinds of life which inhabit planets with atmospheres different from our own. Our type of life form is called “mid-breather”, and constitutes 91% of all life types in the universe. Those which inhabit planets with bigh density atmospheres are termed “superbreathers”, and those inhabiting planets with low density atmospheres are termed “sub-breathers”. _The Urantia Book_ then states that if there is life on Venus it would be of the superbreather class, whilst if life existed on Mars it would be the sub-breather class. Te had no knowledge of the atmospheric densities of these two planets when _the Urantia Book_ was written.

The Mariner 5 probe to Venus in 1967 sent back data on the atmosphere and later probes gave data for Mars. These measurements showed that the atmospheric pressure at the surface of Venus is 90 times that of the Earth, thus high density, whilst that of Mars is 1/100th that of Earth, hence low density.

(_The Urantia Book_ divides atmospheres into 4 categories: none, low, medium, and high densities. A random guess at a planetary atmosphere would have one chance in four of being correct. To be correct for two planets, the chances of being right for both are one in sixteen.)

### The Earth's Moon

_The Urantia Book_ ([UB 57:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p6_3)) tells us that our moon is presently drifting further away from the Earth. Recent measurements have shom this statement to be correct. (See Scientific American 249(6) p.71.)

### Novas

The following extract is quoted verbatim from the Urantia Brotherhood Bulletin (late 1985).

> “The most recent of the major cosmic eruptions in Orvonton was the extraordinary double star explosion, the light of which reached Urantia in A.D. 1572. This conflagration was so intense that the explosion was clearly visible in broad daylight.” ([UB 41:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p3_5))
> 
> In the August 1985 issue of Scientific American, on pages 88-96, three scientists from the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge Massachusetts, present an article entitled “Young Supernova remnants”. This article is of particular interest to scientifically inclined readers of _the Urantia Book_, since it presents a discussion of the nova of 1572 in terms of current thinking about the causes of such events. The story begins in November 1572, when, as a young man, the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe found a “new star” in the constellation Cassiopeia. Tycho observed the star from its appearance, when it was as bright as the planet Venus, until its disappearance in March 1574. Tycho drew an important philosophical lesson from his observations — that the ancient Aristotelian dogma, which asserted the immutability of the realm of fixed stars was false. This realization, supported by an observed event, contributed to the intellectual climate from which sprang the later work of Copernicus, Kepler, and Newton.
> 
> In 1935, the Indian astrophysicist Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar showed that a star which is at least 40% more massive than the sun will, after exhausting its sources of energy, eventually collapse into an extremely dense sphere of matter which explodes violently.
> 
> Current theory holds that one class of novas, called Type I, are actualiy explosions occurring in double star systems. One member of such a double star system is an old, energetically exhausted, and very dense white dwarf star. If the white dwarf orbits close to a companion star, its intense gravity will draw matter from the surface of the second star. Eventually the mass of the dwarf star will grow beyond
> 
> Chandrasekhar's limit, leading to a violent explosion which dismupts both stars. Another class of novas, called Type II, do not arise from double stars, but occur as natural events in the evolution of single, massive stars.
> 
> In 1952, the remnant of Tycho's nova was discovered with the 250-foot radiotelescope at Jodrell Bank. In the years since its discovery, Tycho's remnant has been extensively mapped by radio telescopes and, most recently, by the orbiting Einstein X-ray Observatory. These observations show that Tycho's remnant resulted from the explosion of a double star, as stated in _the Urantia Book_. (end of quote)

In a further comment on novas, _the Urantia Book_ states on UB 41:8.3 as follows:

> “In large suns when hydrogen is exhausted and gravity contraction ensures, and such a body is not sufficiently opaque to retain the internal pressure of support for the outer gas regions, then a sudden collapse occurs. The gravity-electric changes give origin to vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential and such particles readily escape from the solar interior thus bringing about the collapse of a gigantic sun within a few days.” [UB 41:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p8_3)

In the discussion on novas in the same Scientific American article quoted above (253(2), 1985), the theory for the death of large stars at least 8 times as massive as our sun describes the final collapse as causing compression of electrons and protons (i.e. gravity-electric changes) to the point where they combine to form neutrons and neutrinos. When the core is about 10 kM, the collapse comes to a halt, and the gravitational energy is carried outwards by the neutrinos and shock waves which blow off the envelope. The end result is the birth of a neutron star.

The tiny particles devold of electric potential referred to in _the Urantia Book_ correspond to what are now called neutrinos. These tiny particles were not demonstrated to exist until 1956, one year after the first publication of _the Urantia Book_. (see section on sub-atomic physics for further commentary on the neutrino).

And we are delighted to announce our international visitors: Berkeley Elliot, Tom Allan and John Hales. We feel sure they will give us an exciting and vivid account of their experiences and present a unique perspective on the URANTIA movement. Try not to miss this marvellous opportunity!

## Australia — A Pagan Country?

Can you call Australia a pagan country and get away with it ? Apparently not, as I discovered when I attempted this exercise through the media recently. People were both puzzled and offended.

But why? Surely it's time that believers and unbelievers alike faced up to certain realities about the Christian religion in Australia. On the one hand, Christianity is not as insignificant or irrelevant as its optimistic enemies and pessimistic friends seem to think. On the other hand, the residual christianity of the unchurched majority is perceptibly ebbing away.

To be a Christian these days requires a definite commitment. People deliberately choose to go to church rather than merely conform to social pressure. As a result, there is far less hypocrisy about Australian Christianity, and Christians are better informed and better equipped.

But unbelief is sharper too. A generation has come to adulthood without significant contact with Christianity and owing no loyalty to its memory. Children are not baptised and marriages are not held in church. The results of a recent values survey suggest that Australia is the Western world's most secular nation.

This means that society's broad agreement that Christian morality is worth living by is disappearing. The Christian ethic of unconditional love and the pagan ethic of selffulfillment are fundamentally incompatible. You cannot be God-serving and self-serving at the same time.

It is not just a matter of declining church attendance or changing morality. Getting Christianity on the national agenda for reasoned discussion seems to be impossible. The man who said “All great issues are basically theological” never took part in an Australian debate. The God-question seems to be studiously avoided by all parties. Take the so-called “Protestant work ethic”. The phrase has been one of the most popular put-downs of the past 20 years, but has the re ever been a debate on its significance or merits? It has been used to avoid argument, not to provoke it.

Why has Australia become pagan? Some would regard Christianity as intellectually disreputable. It is popularly thought that the Christian position has been demolished. This would be more impressive if there was genuine religious debate in Australia.

The fact is that few believers and even fewer unbelievers have engaged in the rigorous pursuit of the truth about God and the world. The Australian context, historical and natural, should provoke many serious questions. It does not.

It is no accident that the Fest's most secular nation is the country most content to remain in cultural captivity and intellectual shallowness. Christians have contributed to their own decline as an intellectual force. Christian academics — of whom there are not a few — are far too modest to put their views and to insist that they be taken seriously.

To take an example at another level, the unfortunate division between secular and Christian bookshops means that books which may persuade and inform are not in the market-place where the unbeliever buys. Instead, he is confronted with books that promote superstition and the occult.

If the fundamental problem is not intellectual, what is it? For almost 15 years I have been involved in a series of “dialogue meetings” in which one or two Christians meet a larger group of unbelievers and argue the pros and cons of Christian faith.

The opening difficulties constitute a standard range, whether the meetings are held in Carlton or Toorak: “Is the Bible true?”, “Does God exist?”, “What about other religions?”. Such conundrums are often introduced with a sort of elephantine solemnity by middle-aged men who convey the impression that they are the first to think of these shattering questions.

As the evening wears on, however, the real agenda emerges. The problem of pain and suffering in a world ruled by God is discussed. But the standard defence against the claims of Christianity, the objection most deeply felt are that Christians are hypocrites and wowsers. In short, the major stumbling block to the Christian faith is not intellectual but moral. It is to do with the sort of people we are and the sort of people we would like to be.

Christianity is perceived to be about morality; Christians claim to be morally superior; unbelievers respond by claiming to be as good or better because they are not wowsers and therefore not hypocrites. But wowserism is detachable from Christianity. In fact worserism perverts the Christian gospel and makes it unintelligible to the ordinary person.

The distinction between worserism and Christianity has become clear in recent decades as the wowsers have left the church but maintained their extraordinary strong conviction that they know best how the country should behave. The results has been that society is more repressive and puritanical than ever.

The issues have changed. The prohibition of swearing, Sunday trading, the use of alcohol, pornography, divorce, abortion, gambling, are causes that agitate only a minority of people. The battle against Protestant wowserism was won years ago.

From uranium mining through conservation to feminism we live in the day of the issue. Mobile graffiti preach their mini-sermons at us from a million bumper-bars. The language itself has to be altered to conform to the new wowserism and fresh swear words are created: you must not now use “he” to include “she” for example.

We live in a moralistic society.

The present situation presents Christians with an unparalleled opportunity to differentiate between morality and religion. Many of the new wowsers' moral stands are valid and would be endorsed by Christians. But morality is not Christianity. In fact it stands in the way of Christianity.

The real problem for Christianity is the sheer self-confessed decency of people. The new wowsers and their countless followers have an unassailable conviction of their own acceptability to God if God exists. Like patriotism, however, decency is not enough. The Christian message is about reletionships before it is about life-style; specifically, it is about relationship with God. He must come first. Most Australians claim to believe in God; only a minority believe in a personal God. That is a way of saying that the majority have no personal relationship with God they believe exists. Decent people do not need one.

In the Christian view, however, we are a mixture of good and evil, “the glory and shame of the Universe”, to quote Pascal. Even the best of us is unworthy of God. We are, in fact, alienated from God and our alienation shows up in our unwilingness to treat Him as God by thanking Him and worshipping Him, as well as the way in which human relationships are in a mess.

On this view the love of God is not a bland force pervading the universe like the gentle warmth of a spring. It is a fierce, and passionate, love seeking relationship with us that requires a total commitment to Him in return.

Decency is the last and strongest refuge of unbelief. It holds God off by claiming that its moral credentials make up for lack of faith. It fails to see that the first requirement before God is forgiveness.

The Gospels reveal that this was the same problem which dogged Jesus. It was the poor, the weak, the outcast, the fallen, who flocked to him. The righteous expressed their view of him in other ways leading to the cross. “Blessed are the poor in spirit”, said Jeslis, “for theirs is the Kingdom of Heaven.”

## Astronomy — Solving The Riddles

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia image-style-align-left" alt="Galaxy">
<img src="/image/article/606/galaxy.jpg">
</figure>

NEW YORK, AP — The Milky Way — the galaxy in which the Solar System and Earth are located — is being pulled through space at 1,500,000 kmh towards what could be a distant, immense and as yet undiscovered mass. A US-British team at Kitt Peak National Observatory near Tuscon, Arizona discovered the motion by studying about 400 galaxies in a roughly spherical region 350 million light years in diameter. A large part of the univerge appears to be moving together toward the direction in the sky marked by the Southern Cross. 

The gravitational pull of an immense mass might explain the motion, but a motion of this size would appear to require a mass 50 times larger than our orm supercluster and they haven't been able to find the mass yet. A supercluster is a group of galaxies. The mass could be in the form of matter that cannot be detected with current astronomical instruments.

If they can't find the matter, then they may have to rethink theories on the expansion of the universe and the role of gravity.
