## Conference 1986 Report

If there was lack of sunshine outside, there certainly was plenty of it inside. Although the conference was on Saturday and Sunday, for a lot of people who had come from interstate and from overseas, the “getting to know you” had already started on the Thursday and Friday before. Our American visitors still looked bright and cheerful when we picked them up from the airport after their eleven hour flight from Tahiti, where they had visited our good friend Emanuel Iou and his lovely wife Jeannette.

John Hales from Chicago, Berkeley Elliott and Tom Allen from Oklahoma City immediately won our hearts with their personal warmth and sincerity. Jan Francey was waiting for us with a beautiful lunch and we all thoroughly enjoyed each other's company and the delicious food.

Then Pamela Reynolds opened the 1986 National Conference for URANTIA Book readers in Melbourne with “Fhe Lord's Prayer”, her beautiful, clear soprano voice warmed us to the very core of our hearts. Pamela who, together with Jan had organised all the catering is a very active and hardworking member of the Melbourne and Shepparton Study Groups.

After a cordial and warm welcome from Neil Francey to the thirty people who were there on that first day, he gave us a quick preview of the day's proceedings. In Neil's usual inimitable easy style he made everybody immediately feel at home.

Quite a few people have requested that yours truly publish her contribution in the 6-0-6 and if we can find a blank space, we will certainly do so. It was just a few thoughts on the conference theme: “The Tapestry of Loving Service”.

Leith Luckett must have spent hours and hours of deep thought and careful preparation on the beautiful and intriguing artwork, that he presented to the people at the conference.

Kathleen and Trevor Swadling, representing the Sydney Study Group, gave us a report of their group. This couple has been and still is very active in the placement of URANTIA Books in libraries. The results are slow but steady, which is a healthy growth sign. They were very happy tc report a few new tembers in their study group, which has been going for many years.

Peter Mebb had flown all the way from Perth just to be at the conference. He reported that they have quite a good strong study group in the pest. Peter has a Book booth planned for the Australia Day long weekend in January 1987. He welcomes any support that we might be able to give him for his project, but we will keep you informed as time goes by. Life is full of surprises. That certainly was the case for Monika and Mike Patterson from Hobart, Tasmania. Monika wrote to Chicago and received news that a conference was to be held in Melbourne. Although they had read _the URANTIA Book_ for many years, they never knew that there was an Urantia Movement in Australia. Recently they have introduced two more people to _the URANTIA Book_. With the four of them they came to the conference and so ended all the years of reading in isolation. Te were just as delighted as they were to see some friends from Tasmania. Mike and Monika are planning to place free URANTIA books in Libraries over there. So next year we might even see a few more people from the apple isle.

Our sunshine state was represented by Kevin Meyrick. Kevin who comes from Gladstone, Queensland and is the owner of a bookstore, imports our URANTIA BOOKS. One important point that Kevin brought forward during the course of the conference was, that everything comes at a price. If we keep selling _the URANTIA Book_s as cheap as possible, it will mean that every time we sell a book from our book float, a bookstore misses out on a sale. Bookstores have to make a living too and if _the URANTIA Book_ does not sell in their store, they will no longer be interested in keeping it in stock. Kevin pointed out that we in the long mun may defeat our purpose: to make _the URANTIA Book_ readily available to the public.. Even at $60 the Book is still very good value for money.

Here once again the value of group discussion comes to the fore. I think that in future we'Il be better of to direct potential readers to the bookstores and ask them to order it from Chicago. During the waiting period, we could lend them a copy from our book float or send them to their local library, who are always able to get a copy in.

A few Melburnians had a chance to air their views on service activities. But the most wonderful surprise of the conference was Woifgang Borutta's: “Us in relation to the Whole”. Wolfgang, who we all know from his delightful cartoons in the Six-0-Six Newsletter, had created a visual display model of the Master Universe. Together with his friend Sean, he had recorded quotations from _the URANTIA Book_ with beautiful music in the background. As we watched in a pitch dark room, the display box slowly lit up and as the plan of the Master Universe enfolded before our very eyes, we marvelled at the grandeur of it all. Starting with the Isle of Paradise, moving through Havona, the seven Superuniverses and finally the four outer space levels, like a magic wonderland by night the whole display box lit up. It was quite an experience and we all hope that polfgang will get permission to use it in the future.

After morning tea it was time for our Group Discussion Workshop. We were divided into five groups. We received three sheets with questions. On sheet I and II, there were five questions on each sheet. One for each group. Sheet III had to be answered by all groups. Spokesman and a person to take notes were chosen within the group. Tolfgang and Ian, whips in hand (sorry, I mean watches), were our overseers and made sure nobody dwelled too long on one question. It was a wonderful opportunity to get to know each other and a few rusty old brains started creaking again.

I will give you a summary of the outcome in a separate article, but I would like to say something about Group V.

Eyewitnesses can testify that this group had some great debates going. What else do you expect when people like Tom Reynolds, Peter Webb, Rod McCourt and William Wentworth get together. But this group was very wise. They could see straight away that this whole exercise was a conspiracy to make us work. They knew that truth is only relative to the time and place and that in 50 years time our great-grandchildren will go to the State Library and look up old copies of Six-0-Six, to study the early history of the URANTIA movement in Australia. They knew that these same grandchildren would chuckle at some of the answers of the other four groups. And so in their wisdom, like the Master himself, they did not leave a trace of written evidence behind on the big board. Rod, their spokesman, had something scribbled down in a secret code, but he took it with him and unless somebody will come forward. with a few gems from their great discussion, it will remain written in their hearts.

After a delicious lunch it was time for each group's spokesman to give a summary. The general comment was that we just loved these “specific” questions. Group II and IV had the best written summaries. A lively discussion developed. Ian Esmore successfully kept order and stopped people from spilling all their beans on the first day. The service projects were meant for the second day. One point that stood out in our discussion was the feeling of consensus on the question:“Should we have an informal or a formal organization?” Everybody agreed that at this stage we should have an informal organization, with individuals and small groups co-ordinating library placement, plan conferences, buy books and act as an intermational contact. A legal organization is something to keep in mind for the future.

Afternoon tea was followed by John Hales' presentation. John, who loves his job as secretary general of the URANTIA Brotherhood and does not mind the long hours that he works, was a first time visitor to Australia as were the other two. He brought hundreds of slides with him. For more than an hour we watched these and listened to a tape telling us the story of the origin, history and description of _the URANTIA Book_. We heard about the people involved with this great revelation, the birth of the URANTIA Poundation and URANTIA Brotherhood. This hour was of great interest to us all. Old and new readers alike learned a great deal from John's presentation.

We have had a request from Ken Glasziou, who we all know as that clever scientist in Queensland, for an article about the origin of _the URANTIA Book_. Ken wrote : “I would be interested in an article on the actual writing of _the URANTIA Book_ and the people associated with its initial publication, who they were and what they did. Is any information available? I'm sure 6-0-6 readers would like to know more.”

Ken, pity you couldn't make it to the conference. You would have loved John Hales' presentation. We will try to oblige and publish an article on this subject.

To keep things in balance, Steven Shanahan, our reversion director for the night, had organized dinner in a lovely Italian restaurant. It became a great night. The company, the food, the wine and the music were superb:

The next morning the Reynolds were in top form. Pamela sang a group of three songs and Tom gave us something to ponder on with: “Who am I?” Sundaymorning was spent on the study of Paper 99 of _the URANTIA Book_: “The Social Problems of Religion”.

We split up in two groups for this. There was never a dull moment in our group: At one stage Will decided he better take Cathy out of the room to finish their discussion, so the rest of the group could get on with it:

After lunch Berkeley Elliott talked about some of her experiences in the 30 years since she first found _the URANTIA Book_. She told us about the various study groups in Oklahoma City. One important point that came forward out of Berkeley's talk was that we are all tested for patience. That steady growth in readers will occur if we are just patient and don't expect miracles overnight. Berkeley commented how much she felt at home in Australia. We seem to wrestle with the same kind of problems. It is nice to know that we all have the same Father to go to for love and strength in dealing with these problems.

Tom Allen, who is involved with the Library Placement scheme, told us how over the last few months one guy placed hundreds of books in libraries. Tom feels it is still the most successful way to let _the URANTIA Book_ find its way to the public. He has made us more enthusiastic to step up our library placement in Australia.

The time had come to knuckle down to the nit-ty grit-ty of the conference. We needed a chairman with a firm hand and a powerful voice to keep order. Our obvious choice was William Wentworth, who handled it with ease. The outreach decisions that came out of this session, Neil Francey will cover in his article.

This conference was living proof that when we are guided by the spirit within us, we can work in harmony. Things always flowed smoothly. We were unified in our goal: to make mankind aware of their sonship with the Father and their brotherhood with their fellowmen.

I want to say thank you on behalf of all of us here in Melbourne to all the people, who have helped to make this conference a success, including all those quiet workers in the background.

Conferences are about people. People who had come from far and near. And if some of them were new to us before the conference, we all departed like old friends with promises to see each other again.

## Want To Join A Study Group ?

## Commentary On Scientific Statements In _The Urantia Book_, Part III

### Cosmoiogy — The Red Shift

A train whistle from a train speeding towards us grows higher in pitch as the train approaches, and the pitch gets lower as the train moves away. Because of the train's motion the sound waves are compressed, hence higher in pitch (frequency) as the train approaches, and decompressed (lower frequency) as the train moves away. This is called the Doppler effect. The same effect is used to account for the spectral shift of light coming from far away stars. Spectral bands are usually shifted towards longer wave lengths, that is towards the red. The so-called red shift is the basis of estimates of the age of the universe, currently said to be between 10 and 20 billion years, anc also gives rise to the Big Bang theory of its origin. _The Urantia Book_ states this is quite wrong, that the effect is due to other causes, and of course, gives a very much greater age to the grand universe.

A clue to the possible cause of the red shift is found on [UB 58:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/58#p2_8) where it is stated: “the power of sunspots to alter light frequencies shows that these solar storm centres function as enormous magnets”. If I interpret correctly, light passing through an electromagnetic field should show a shift in wave length, and perhaps this effect is at least partially responsible for the red shift of far away stars. Andromeda: — On [UB 15:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p4_7) of _the Urantia Book_ we are told that if we observe Andromeda we are looking at light that left that nebula almost one million years ago. At the time of writing of _the Urantia Book_, Andromeda was thought to be about one million light years away. Current estimates are about 2.2 miliion light years, and are probably close to correct. This may mean that the author of that particular paper in _the Urantia Book_ has goofed, or else has interpreted the limitations on revelation very literaliy.

### Continental Drift, Geology, Palaeontology, and Anthropology

_The Urantia Book_ states categorically that all land on earth was originally a single continent which subsequently broke up to give the continents, which then drifted away from one another over a long period of time.

The idea of continental drift was mooted in the 19th century and first put forward as a comprehensive theory by Wegener in 1912. It was not well. accepted, becoming and remaining discredited amongst geologists well into the 1960's before support began to accumulate, and becoming generally accepted during the 1970-1980 period.

_The Urantia Book_ was published in 1955 when the theory of continental drift received very poor support. The writers of _the Urantia Book_ are obviously exceedingly knowledgeable and very intelligent, and could not have been unaware of the very tenuous nature of the theory of continental drift. If they are not what they claim to be (messengers for a revelation), then they would have to be very foolish indeed to give such prominence to continental drift in their account of the early history of Urantia, for unless it is correct, they discredit the whole of the book. It would have been quite easy to write such a history, avoiding this and many other similar traps that would throw doubt on their claims of revelation.

_The Urantia Book_ is at variance with present day geology in respect to dating of geological time, for instance for the Carboniferous and Devonian periods where the discrepancy is about 100,000,000 years. I am not able to comment on the accuracy of the methods of dating used by geologists except to note that I have read that accuracy is poor beyond one hundred million years. My experience as a professional scientist was such as to make me aware that few scientigts are error conscious when it comes to sampling and analytical measurements. Pew realise that a good analytical method is likely to have a 5% error margin, that many commomly used methods have a 10% margin and lots are far worse. Nor is it realized that errors are additive, that is, if a sampling error is 10%, and the error of an analytical method is also 10%, the final figure quoted has a 20% error margin. This is not the place to write a treatise on error, but to make us aware that science is by no means infallible, hear the following. The 1984 edition of Encyclopedia Britannica's Science and Technology Vol7, p. 844-5 presents a series of maps depicting the progress of continental drift for the period 10 to 150 milition years ago. The same progression is depicted in an article in the April issue of Scientific American (1985), using a different method to arrive at conclusions. There is a difference of at least 100,000,000 years in depicting many aspects of this progression, and that surely is a very large error indeod. A further example of vast differences in dating geological events is for the commencement of continental drift. In Richard Leaky's book “The Making of Mankind”, published in 1981 on p. 32 we read: “Two hundred million years ago all the continents were in contact, forming a single supercontinent known as Pangaea.” In the Encyclopedia Britannica's Science and Technology Illustrated vol. 7 p.844 this date is extended to more than 225 miliion years. In an article in Scientific American 250(2) p.41, 1984 we read “A conspicuous rise in the diversity of large, spheroidal cyst forming acritarchous eukaryotes in late Ripherian times — between 900 and 700 million years ago — can be seen. This trend coincides with a period in which the major preexisting continents broke “up”.Presumably this latter dating of the commencement of continental drift to 700-900 million years ago reflects a recent major revision in the thinking of some geologists. It is of interest that _the Urantia Book_ written so many years back states ([UB 57:8.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p8_23)) that the first break in the continental land mass began 750 million years ago. _The Urantia Book_ [UB 59:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/59#p6_5) places the disappearance of the land bridges between the Americas and Europe and Africa in the era between 160 and 170 million years ago. An article in Scientific American, June 1979 places it at 165 million years. However land bridges connected the continents indirectly at later times via Greenland, Iceland, and the Bering Straits, and also connected South America through to Australia via Antartica (Urantia Book [UB 61:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_12), and Scientific American January 1983, p.60).

_The Urantia Book_ [UB 60:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/60#p2_2) states the remains of the monster dinosaurs are buried in N.America, Europe, Africa and India, but not in Australia. Up to the present no monster dinosaur fossils have been found in Australia.

The fossil evidence leaves it uncertain whether marsupials originated in Australia and radiated via Antartica to South America and subsequentiy to Europe, or the reverse. _The Urantia Book_ tells us that the ancestors of the kangaroo lived in Australia 45 million years ago and that there was a land bridge to South America via Antartica 35 million years ago ([UB 61:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_3)). Recently, marsupial fossils were discovered on Sejmour Island in Antartica (see Scientific American, January 1983) which is consistent with the radiation of the marsupials via an Antartica land bridge, and probably means that marsupials originated in Australia.

The American Indian: — _The Urantia Book_ [UB 64:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/64#p6_5) tells us that the red man crossed from Asia to America 85,000 years ago. Until recently it was believed that the Americas had been inhabited for no more than 12,000 years. This has now been extended to greater than 30-40,000 years (see Scientific American, 249,6, 1985)

## Australia — A Pagan Country? A Rejoinder

by William Wentworth

I very much enjoyed the article by Dr. P. Jensen in the June issue. I can well understand his frustration with the growing secularism of Australians; and I share his view that the “new wowsers” are a secular version of the old variety, propagating feminism, environmentalism, pacifism etc. in place of Sunday observance and temperance.

I was particularly pleased to notice his clear distinction between Christianity on the one hand, and Christian morality on the other, together with his observation that sometimes morality stands in the way of Christianity.

But I believe he errs in blaming “decency” as the real problem for Christianity.

It is, after all, from bitter experience that people fear the wowser in Christian teachers. It was not so long ago that such teachers would make blatant use of the notion of respectability to frighten nervous sinners into the pews on Sundays. When God was owned by Christians, and morality was something they enforced on His behalf, many were intimidated into feigning belief. _The URANTIA Book_ points out that “Secularism can never bring peace to mankind.” ([UB 195:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p8_6)) but goes on to warm “But mark you well: do not be quick to surrender the beneficient gains of the secular revolt from ecclesiastical totalitarianism.” Narrow Christian morality attempted to dominate Christianity itself, and thoughtful people finally began to pluck up their courage and refuse to be blackmailed by the wowser element in the churches. It was probably inevitable that, in the absence of a more tolerant religious attitude, many of them would bog down in secular humanism.

Dr. Jensen, however, highlights a real opportunity for Christianity to recover some of this lost ground. The crux of the matter is his opinion that: “The Christian ethic of unconditional love and the pagan ethic of self-fulfillment are fundamentally incompatible.” Christians have fostered this notion over the centuries through reasoning which seems valid to them. But they overlook that the Christian ethic can absorb and upstep the pagan ethic by regarding self-fulfillment as that experience which results from attempting to do the will of God. Christians tend to view loving God as a duty, the discharge of which requires the sacrifice of personal will. But as _the URANTIA Book_ points out: “It is loyalty, not sacrifice, that Jesus demands. The consciousness of sacrifice implies the absence of that wholehearted affection which would have made such a loving service a supreme joy. The idea of duty signifies that you are servant-minded and hence are missing the mighty thrili of doing your service as a friend and for a friend.” ([UB 180:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p1_6))

If Christians could bring themselves to accept real sonship with God, their spiritual Father, they would find that loving Him and trying to do His will constitutes the acme of self-fulfillment, and in this discovery they absorb the pagan ethic into their own higher one. Instead of regarding personal will as something to be surrendered and sacrificed, they could view it as something to be focussed and mobilised in the service of God, and in this consists true spiritual liberty when “It is my will that your will be done.” ([UB 118:8.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/118#p8_11))

When Christians make this transition from “servant mindedness” to “son mindedness”, the ideational scaffolding of sacrifice and atonement becomes unnecessary, and thus much of the self-righteousness which lurks in the baser aspects of Christianity ceases to trap its followers.

The great truth of the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man, which shines like a beacon out of the best of Christianity, then just might attract some of those secular minded Australians who unknowingly yearn to discover it.

## Who Am I

At one pole of my being, I am at one with the physical world of reality. The other pole of my being is separate from all. I stand alone. I am “I”! I am incomparable — unique!

Man and nature cannot destroy this reality of me, this island of consciousness. Only I can destroy it with my own selfishness.

This individuality holds its own against the forces of ignorance and fear, for they try to pull us down to a sameness of mind and spirit, which is a self caused poverty of God given gifts.

If this individuality is lost, all is lost. This loss is at once not only individual, but also universal, as this unique individuality is a creation by God from the universal and is meant to become a full partner with God.

That this individuality is considered by man as his most precious possession is proved by the suffering he undergoes and the sins he commits for its sake. If the individual self meant nothing to us but pain and sacrifice, would we still hold it at such a high value? The enemies of this individual self of ours are many: they lie within us, very subtle but real and they take many forms, such as selfishness, pride, criticism, self righteousness and idleness. We will highlight the point with one example.

Many of us who study spiritual writings seem to get lost in intellectual comprehension and fail to see the divine spiritual message of salvation for all, even the blind, the handicapped and the socially deprived.

The person cursed with the literal mind is the unfortunate one, for they are always so busy with their own image that they fail to see their neighbour's needs.

The rich man who talked with Christ found the entry price to heaven too high,for his possessions had become his treasure and security. His vision was limited to literal comprehension, for whatever we treasure for ourselves can stand in the way of love — separation from God.

It is not so much the possessions we have, be they material, mental or spiritual, that are important. It is our attitudes towards these things that is of major importance. Then we hold them too close to ourselves and refuse to share wisely with others.

What has this to do with service? The path of love — service and individual progression is the same path, for it leads on to individual health, more full and deeper relationships with others, self forgetfulness, self development and better Adjuster guidance. To share ourselves with others and not to stand above and dispense as one who is better than them is the key, the golden key to success and security, here, now and in all future times.

## Broken Wings

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia" alt="Flying">

Not everybody can lay claim to the statement that he had to fall out of the sky to find _the URANTIA Book_, but that's precisely what Louis de Keizer is saying.

One day Louis was floating up in the sky, carried by gentle breezes and the big wings of his hangglider. The world looked beautiful from above and life was peaceful and happy.

But the Gods had something else in mind for Louis and he was painfully reminded that all good things come to an end. Louis and his hangglider crashed down and finished up in a twisted heap. One particular couple of bystanders were true Samaritans. They carted Louis off to the hospital, where they stitched up the big gash in his knee. With a little more dinted and bruised than just his pride,Iouis went home with the same people who offered him accomodation for the night. During the conversation that night they introduced him to “The Course of Miracles”, which in turm led him to our good friends Bridget and Christopher Bilington. This couple, who were themselves still fairly new to _the URANTIA Book_, were about to retire in East Gippsland. But before they did they told Louis about the book and also about the Brighton Study Group. Louis still remembers that first night when a whole new world opened up for him. That happened in May 1985 and he has been reading _the URANTIA Book_ with great enthusiasm ever since. Congratulations Louis! You landed on target after all. You came across circles of a different kind. The seven psychic ones!

One of the first questions that URANTIA Book readers ask each other usually is: “How did you find the Book?”

Six-0-Six would like to hear from other readers just how you found the Big Blue Book.
