## The Tapsstry Or Loving Service

Why did we give the conference theme this name? In a tapestry there are many different colours; There are light and dark colours, warm and cool colours, colours for shading and colours for highlighting. All these are necessary if we are to achieve a harmonious whole. For was it not for the shading in the background, how could the highlight stand out against the rest?

Similarly in a group of people, there are many different personalities. They give the colour to the group. But sometimes it is difficult to blend different personelities into a hemonivus working unit.

I think all of us have the secret ambition to fuse with our Thought Adjuster one day. But what does fusion really mean? As far as I can see, it means that two entities, one pre-personal and the other one personal, become as one. They have taken on each other's identity. You can't tell them apart anymore. That's what we are aiming for. To identify ourselves with our Thought Adjuster.

I realize, that we are still a long, long way off from that point in our universe career, but let us assume for a moment that we were weil on our way. By that time our Adjuster would be firmly in control of our thoughts. This fragment of the Universal Father Is LOVE, UNCONDITIONAL LOVE:

If we saw things through the eyes of our Divine Monitor, would we then say to our friend: “I am only zoing to love you and co-operate with you if you are nice to me and if you agree with me. If you have a different opinion. I an going to get very upset and maybe even angry”.

Of course not: Our Mought Adjuster is incepable of anger or intolerance. He is incapable of impatience. He is non-judgmental and does not criticize. He loves our friend, whatever the cost, through thick and thin, in sickness and in health, even when he becones hard to get on with. Our Thought Adjuster does not expect uniformity from our priend. He knows that our friend likes to add the colour of his or her own personality to the tapestry of the group. Maybe our friend likes to stay in the shading colour of the background to give support to the highlight of another personality. Maybe he or she makes a marvellous listener. Our friend could be more a person of deeds than of words.

Te all have many different talents. Let us be patient win each other, for those talents to enfold when the time is ripe. Let us be encouraging to each other. Let us not expect more from our friend than he is ready to achieve. Live and let live. Let us give each other the freedom to choose our own colour for this tapestry. Why not give the reins of our carriage to our Divine Coachman? Let us see things through the eyes of love. Every time we are tempted to become intolerant, let us remember that Divine Lover, who lives within our mind and who never runs out of patience or who never says: “I have been tolerant long enough now.” If we are truly serious about dedicating our life to doing the Father's will, then let us start identifying ourselves with our Divine Monitor, who never becomes offended. If wo want to be the disseminators of the Fifth Epochal Revelation, then let us be worthy of it.

Loving service is the best antidote for the unbalanced state of fanaticism or overintellectualization of _The URANTIA Book_. I'm sure there will be plenty of good suggestions on how we can best serve. I think together we could weave a beautiful tapestry of loving service, which is the only gift we can offer to our heavenly Father.

## Outreach Decisions — 1986 National Conference

The firal sesaion at the recent Nationai Conference was taken up with a lively group discussion under the guidance of our chairman Will Wentworth. We set about reviewing our current projects and co-ordinating efforts for the future. Goals could be set in the light of the discussions over the previous day and a half. The time for establishing outreach plans had arrived.

_The Newsletter_: The present level of voluntary subscription was inadequate to fund future demand. The position is to be reviewed early 1987. Fund raising for special projects could be launched via 6-0-6. (For this purpose we have now opened a bank account under the name: Six-0-Six Newsletter) URANTIA Bulletin wishes to announce 6-0-6 subscription details to overseas readers. We will not embark on this expanaion until we have results of the Reader's Survey, review coating and establish the necesaary administrative processes.

_Study Groups_: Their value was emphasised and estabished groups should assist in the formation of other groups, especially for readers in country areas.

_Book Booths_: A Book booth is planned by the Perth Study Group for the long weekend in Jan. 1987 to co-incide with the America's Cup Defence. Many expressed interest in attending. Books are to be made available for sale and display. Advice is to be sought from those previously involved with booths. Accomodation could be provided for interstate visitors. Booths can then be planned at appropriate venues in other capital cities.

_Loan Copies_: From our stock on hand a number of copies could be made available for loan. Please write to 6-0-6 to arrange.

_Advertising_: Virtually no response from newspapers, despite a variety of advertisements over many years. Not recommended.

_Telephone listing_: A listing in the telephone book under ‘URANTIA Book Study Group’ is permissable and highly recommended. Listings in Melbourne and Perth have led people to the book.

_Display Windows_: A great concept! Finding a suitable location, providing a contact number, and having a display copy seem to be the only requirements.

_Conferences_: The June 1987 conference is to be held in Sydney. Details to be announced in 6-0-6. For the conference in June 1988, Australia's bi-centenery, all readers in the Pacific area should be invited to make it a Pacific Area Conference. Specially Fiji, Tahiti, and New Zealand. Early notificetion to readers in the United States is advisable.

Papers to be presented at conferences should be forwarded for review some 6 months prior. Organizers can then co-ordinate the program, avoid duplication, be acquainted with all subject matter and prepare synopsis for agenda and discussion purposes.

_Distribution_: The present policy of making the book available at a discount on retail should be discontinued when the book becomes readily available in the larger bookstores. Activity outside the established book industry would ultimately lead to the book being abandoned by the trade. This situation to be constantly monitored. Mention was also made that it is not our function to import. We should cease and concentrate on the teachings.

It was also suggested that we have the option to make a small profit on books which would assist in offsetting other costs.

_Media Display_: We should recognize opportunities for Wolfgang Borutta to present his media display and notify him accordingly via 6-0-6.

_Concordex_: The third edition will be svailable from July 1986 . Books to be ordered and made available via 6-0-6.

_Appreciation_: A very big thank you to all those whose fiforts ade the conference such an outstanding success.

We reckoned that included all of ust

## Internationai Committee Chooses Aussie Member

After a recommendation by their chairman Berkeley Elliott, Neil Francey was elected member of the Interational Fellowship Committe and will be serving for a term of six years. Those of us, who have worked with Neil for a while know that he always saw Australia as just another suburb of our planet Urantia, and would greatly welcome the opportunity to serve in this capacity. I think most of us will agree that we couldn't wish for a better person to represent Australia overseas.

Our very best wishes go with you, Neil, on this new venture, one of the many still ahead and waiting for you in your universe career.

## Six-0-Six Newsletter Survey

We like to thank all those people, who responded to the recent 6-0-6 survey.

To all those, who have not done so as yet, how about sending yours off today.

Here are some of the comments we received:

You are doing a great job. I think the newsletter should remain a monthly event, so wo can stay in touch that much more. It's the only contact a lot of us have with other readers and it would be a shame to widen the gap.

Kathleen Swadling, Sydney.

I think children would be too young to appreciate most of _The URANTIA Book_, although a childhood introduction would bear fruit in later life I suppose. 

Mike Taylor, Shepparton.

I was very impreased with my eirst 6-0-6, especially the well written conference report.

Shirley May, Melbourne.

Suggest you work out a 6 monthly or yearly budget and a total cost per subscriber, and let people know that the donation equal to that or higher (for those who could not afford it) would be appreciated. It's nice to keep giving, but it's not nice to keep taking only, and wo all have an obligation towards each other and to this material existence of ours. Some may not agres, but love is not going to pay our financial debts. We alone have to make an effort. Remember life will not let us get away with any kind of debts, material or spiritual, and payment is extracted sooner or later with terrible effectiveness.

Stefan Cvekus, Brisbane.

I feel it best to produce good leaflet four times a year with many articles that do not necessarily date: I cannot be bothered to read a monthly: Any way of production to make the editors life easier is a good idea!

Michael King, Sydney.

I believe everybody should pay a little amount of money to cover general cost ( $10 or $15 a year, if it is sufficient)

You're doing a great job! I include cheque as support for cost, material and mailing.

I think the Newsletter should have a set number of articles. I mean in each publication have a scientific article, international news of _the URANTIA Book_, the thought for the wonth, a philosophic corner, interpretation and discussion of some quotations, etc. It will make the work easier for you and more interesting for the readers. The organization is important, it is the dogmatic crystallization that constitutes a danger.

Giampiero Pollicino, Gold Coast, Pld.

Six-0-Six is an enjoyablo Newsletter. Pleased to ge its frowth during the last 12 monthe. Iris Eckersiy, Melbourne.

I don't think the Newsletter is likely to outreach to new readers. Unless there is a fair or particular public outreach and then effort could be in this direction for one or two issues. I think those involved in the Newsletter have done very well. The standard has steadily increased over the past 12-18 months, and it is in a better position for consistent level of input from readers i.e. readers ars using the Newsletter as a medium more so than in the past, and that is a result of greater group energy and zealous editors. Keep up the good work!

Ian Esmore, Melbourne.

## The Thought for the Month

> The relifion of Jesus transcends all our former concepts of the idee of worship in that he not only portrays his Father as the ideal of infinite reality but positively declares that this divine source of values and etermal center of the universe is truly and personally attainable by every mortal creature who chooses to enter the kingdom of heaven on earth, there by acknowledging the acceptance of sonship with God and brotherhood with man. That, I submit, is the highest concept of religion the world has ever known, and I pronounce that there can never be a higher since this gospel enbraces the infinity of realities, the divinity of values, and the etemity of universal atteinments. ([UB 160:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p5_7))

## Springtime

A study of the Future

Now ‘prophesies’ are appearing among believers in _The URANTIA Book_, it may be opportune and helpful to study more deeply what our book says about the relatively near future.

The most significant things Jesus said about it are to be found in section 2 of paper 176 . On [UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3) he said: “The things which you now look down upon are coming to an end, but this will be a new be ginning out of which the gospel of the kingdom will go to all the world and this salvation will spread to all peoples. And when the kingdom shali have cone to its fuil fruition, be assured that the Father in heaven will not fail to visit you with an _enlarged revelation of truth_ ...”

This ‘enlarged revelation of truth’ has already appeared, The URANTIA PAPERS. The Master makes it clear that he indeed means our book, becauge he continues: “... even as he has already bestowed upon this world him, who became the prince of darkness (Caligastia, first epochal revelation), and then Adam (second epochal revelation), who was followed by Melchizedek (third revelation of epochal significance), and in these days, the Son of Man (fourth epochal revelation).”

On [UB 92:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_4) is stated: “There have been many events of religious revelation, but only five of epochal significance.” The firgt four are the same as mentioned by Jesus. The fifth is mentioned as THE URANTIA PAPERS, the authentic name of our book. It is evident that Jesus already 2000 years ago foretold the coming of our book, a book of epochal significance and even more, because it heralds a new dispensation.

From this fulfillment of hig promise we can deduce also that the kingdom indeed has come to its full fruition ([UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3)), as Jesus declared this to be a condition for the appearing of the enlarged revelation of truth. Now this revelation did appear, this proves that the kingdom indeed has come to its full fruition. But what did Jesus mean by these words? Has all the world become Jesusonian or even Christian? Surely not; the meaning must be different.

Jesus could, for evolutionary reasons, not reveal is much truth as the fifth epochal revelation contains. Revelation is progressive. Therefore to me the meaning of ‘coming to its full fruition’ is that about all that reasonably could be expected to be attained by the fourth epochal revelation, given time and circumstances, has been attained.

Jesus taught the Fatherhood of God, the relationship between the individual and his personal Father. Our book expands this revelation to the revelation of the Universal Father, the Father of the whole planet and all planets. Jesus purposely limited his revelation to the spiritual domain, mainly the personal spiritual domain. Our book includes also the material and physical domains, which are not merely personal. The universe, the planet, the population, the group, and the community are extensively dealt with too. But fully in accordance with the thoroughness of the universe, it rehearses at length the earlier revelations, particular in part IV.

Returning to [UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3) we find that imediately after the words ‘an enlarged revelation of truth’, Jesus also promised, in the same sentence, ‘an enhanced demonstration of righteousness’.

During geveral years I have overlooked these words, or at least, they did not catch my attention. Subconsciously I considered them as a kind of embellishment of the ‘enlarged revelation of truth’ part. But the authors, and certainly Jesus, are not given to embelilishment and superfluous terminology.

So let us try to find the meaning of these words.

Their meaning must be closely connected with ‘the enlarged revelation’, they immediately follow each other in the same sentence. In our discussion of the fifth epochal revelation so far, we found that, besides the domain of personal religious experience, on which the fourth revelation was focused, it also includes the community aspects. And in the social community righteousness is a fundamental value. True, it is also basic in the individual experience, but personally we can, and should, discover righteousness, the will of God, through communion with the indwelling great teacher, the Adjuster. The community however, has in general not attained to that indispensable level. So the Father and his Son, our Planetary Prince, will send us, compelled by love, a demonstration of righteousness. On the following page Jesus explains that this demonstration implies a demonstrator. ([UB 176:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_5)) This apparently does not refer to his personal return to earth.

After having repeated his promise “I will sometime return” he explains that this return “will be with power and in the spirit”, only visible to “the eye of the spirit”, not to “the eye of the flesh”. Therefore this return can hardiy be identical with “another dispensational bestowal”, mentioned in [UB 176:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_5). Moreover Jesus add “the times of the reappearing of the Son of Man are known only in the councils of Paradise; not even the angels in heaven know when this will occur.” And on [UB 176:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_5) the midwayers surmise: “But if every eye is to behold him, and if only spiritual eyes are to discem his presence, then must his advent be long deferred.”

Continuing our study and meditation of Jesus' words, we read [UB 176:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_5): “However, you should understand that, when this gospel of the kingdom shall have been proclaimed to all the world for the salvation of all peoples, ...” This is a repetition of the conditions for the appearing of ‘the enlarged revelation of truth’ on [UB 176:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_3). And we have already seen that because of the actual appearance of the enlarged revelation of truth, this condition must have been fulfilled. And because in this paragraph Jesus deals with “another dispensational bestowal”, this condition has been fulfilled too with regard to this bestowal.

But Jesus adds another condition: “...and when the fullness of the age has come to pass, ...” Most of us know the revelators told the contact commissioners more than once that the book has been given “long before its _time_” or in another version “a hundred years before its time”. Its time is the new epoch, or dispensation. The new dispensation can only come “when the fullness of the age (the present dispensation) has come to pass.” This has not yet occurred, and so we live in an interim period between the appearence of the book and the dispensation that begins with a dispensational bestowal. It is this intarim Jesus refers to when he adds this new condition. How carefully Jesus chose his words on this memorable tuesday evening: And of course it is another proof of Jesus' statement, “the Father and the son know all things.”

What could be the purpose of such an interim period? A bestowal is far from being just an accident in the evolution of the planet; it is most carefully planned in the universe. And this planning includes a certain activity from the side of the receivers of such a bestowal. This is illustratad in the cases of Adam and Jesus. In the latter case there had been prophetic predictions to the extent that all Jewry was expecting a new Messiah. And John the Baptist had been destined to become the forerunner of the new kingdom. The world must be prepared for the new dispensational bestowal. Therefore our book as a phase of the new dispensation has been given before its time, to be followed later by the complemental phase of the ‘demonstrator of righteousness’. And we, as the receivers of the pre-bestowal book have been given the mandate “to form thousands of study groups” to the end there may be “teachers and leaders” for the time “when the fullness of the age hes come to pass”.

THE URANTIA PAPERS, though of epochal significance, and belonging to the new epoch, do not constitute in themselves the beginning of a new dispensation. But the dispensational bestowal, the demonstrator of righteousness does constitute the new dispensation. Apparently _The URANTIA Book_ has been given in advance and this gives a new meaning and dimension to the book for is who live in this interim time. He should not study it for personal salvation only, how indispensable this may be. After having secured personal salvation, the alert and understanding reader gives attention to the responsibility and task this enlarged revelation of truth assigns to him in connection with the coming bestowal.

And then Jesug adds something that many times has caused me much trouble. “...the Father will send you another dispensational bestowal, _or else the Son of Man will return to adjudge the age_.” In itself it is not remarkable that the To know, ([UB 20:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p3_4)) : “When a Paradise Son visits an evolutionary world and becones like one of its people, his presence terminates a dispensation and constitutes a fudgment of the realm.” Jesus has terminated the Adam dispensation and opened a new one, the dispensation of the spirit of Truth. We have not had a Magistarial Son to do this, and therefore it seems logical that our Paradise Son should return to adjudge the age. Such a judicial mission is not a bestowal and the Son will not be visible on such mission.

But my real trouble lies in the little word ‘else’. Taken literaliy, and on itself, this could mean there even will not be another bestowal: Though I am inclined to reason that, because of the fulfillment of the condition of “the full fruition”, and the actual appearance of “the enlarged revelation of truth”, the second part of Jesus' promise will be fulfilled also, nevertheless this last part of the sentence could contain a certain warning to us. Could it be that we, who have been privileged and blessed with the knowledge of these promises of the Master, and having a special reponsibility in the preparation for this dispensational bestowal, may fail in our tasks? Does it matter if we should or should not do our duty in the execution of Michael's plans? We also belong to the group that is designated on [UB 176:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_8) as “stewards of truth”, and wo also might be qualified as “barren stewards”. Why is there no increage, no growing increase in the number of study groups? Why a setback in the distribution of books? “In accordance with the truth _committed to your hands_, (THE URANTIA PAPERS), will the Master of truth require a reckoning.”

After having dealt with “the travail of Jerusalem” and the return of the Son of Man of which “no one in heaven or on earth may presume to speak”, he continues with the subject in which we actually are interested now, in our time. “But you should be wise regarding the ripening of an age; you should be alert to discern the signs of the times. You know when the fig tree shows its tender branches and puts forth its leaves that summer is near. Likewise, when the world has passed through the long winter of material-mindedness and you _discern the coming of the spiritual springtime of a new dispensation_, you should know that the summertine of a new visitation draws near.”

We do discern the signs of the times: the “gospel of the kingdom” has gone to all the world and all peoples, the “full fruition” has been achieved, and last but not least “the enlarged revelation of truth” has appeared. The midwayers state: “At the time of this writing (the year 1935) the worst of the materialistic age is over ([UB 195:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_4))...” Therefore the spiritual springtime is _now_.

If we return for a moment to the statement that the book has been given “a hundred years before its time”, it is remarkable to find this period also mentioned in our book. It is on [UB 176:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_7): “Here, Master,is the truth you committed to us a hundred or a thousand years ago...” (The number ‘thousand’ also is not accidental, as may be explained later). It is not uncommon for our book to reveal something in such an unconspicuous way. The book has been given to be studied, not for superficial reading. A superficial reader does not notice such things, but an alert student will try to connect them with other items and so gain new, often surprising insights, or indications that his own line of thinking is correct.

Another corroborative fact is, as known by many among us, that the book for the _first one hundred years_ has been given in the custody of “the angels of the churches”, while after that period the progress angels take over. The “angels of the churches” endeavour to maintain the ideals of that which has survived for the sake of the safe transit of mortal values from one _epoch to another_, while the progress angels “are entrusted with the task of initiating the evolutionary progress of the _successive_ social age.” ([UB 114:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_6))

There are more places in the book that point to a new bestowal. On [UB 20:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p9_1) is said of the Trinity Teacher Sons that “they even now visit your world for the purpose of formulating plans concerning their projected sojourn on your sphere. They will be due to appear on Urantia after its inhabitants have gained comparative deliverance from the shackles of animalism and from the fetters of materialism.” Remember the statement of the Midwayers on [UB 195:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p6_4): “The worst of the materialistic age is over”.

The Teacher Sons come to initiate a spiritual ase, “a millenium of cosmic enlightenment”. Future dispensations are not going to last tens of thousands of years, they become much shorter as evolution advances. In this light should be seen the “thousand years”, mentioned above.

Teacher Sons are normally accompanied by a Magisterial Son for the necessary judicial action. Because we have not had a Magisterial Son, the Son of Man could (invisible to the living mortals on earth) reappear, as is mentioned on [UB 176:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_8), where it is stated that he judges the “stewards of truth”.

It is worthwhile to study sections 7 to 9 of paper 20 for a better understanding of the purposes of the Trinity Teacher Sons. On [UB 20:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/20#p9_2) it is stated: “They make real the spiritual counterparts of material knowledge and temporal wisdom”. We now have a “society which staggers under the guilt of tolerating science without idealism, politics without principles, wealth without work, pleasure without restraint, knowledge without character, power without conscience, and industry without morality.” ([UB 195:10.20](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_20)) The Teacher Sons will make real the spiritual counterparts of these otherwige empty and senseless attainments. Is not this wholly in agreement with a bestowal-demonstretion of righteousness?

Trinity Teacher Sons remain invisible, but are accompanied by the Brilliant Evening Stars, who serve as “liaisons between the mortals of the realm and the invisible corps of Teacher Sons.” The Brilliant Evening Stars are also invisible to mortals, but they “possess a spirit force which can be manifested independently of their personal presence”. ([UB 37:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p2_5)) “The entire world (of Jerusem) has been rendered spiritualiy fragrant (by the Brilliant Evening Stars) since so many of their activities were transferred here from Salvington”. (Such an unusual transference to the capital of our system is also meaningful). So Teacher Sons together with Brililant Evening Stars can have a very powerful influence on a planet, even when invisible. When this will be complemented with a visible demonstrator and his liaisons, tremendous changes in the spiritual atmosphere of the planet may be expected.

On [UB 37:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p3_4) is the well-known paragraph about the divisional headquarters of the archangels on Urantia. “Do you grasp the significance of the fact that your lowly and confused planet has become a divisional headquarters for the universe (not planetary, neither system nor constellation, but universe) administration and direction of certain archangel activities having to do with the Paradise ascension scheme? This undoubtedly presages the future concentration of other ascendant activities on the bestowal world of Michael and lends a tremendous and solem import to the Master's personal promise. “I will come again.” Another example of universe speculation! In the planning of Michael, Urantia evidently is to become an important centre. This “lowly and confused planet” has rejected its rightful Sovereign. And this is the divine retribution: Urantia will become a jewel in the crown of Michael, our Master, through a concentrated effort of his and the Father's ministers. Is this of no concern to us now? No, indeed, if we are interested merely in personal salvation and organization, if we do not become universe-minded. His plans are partially revealed already now. This means a challenge to our study and understanding, and a call for co-operation. We belong to this Urantia, now and even after death. But let us not repeat the foolishness of mere human activity without spiritual enlightenment, and let us not be proud, we are only servants! Let us be sure to really co-operate with the powers that be. And the first step in this is the growing communion with the Father within. This is the first phase of the kingdom, ([UB 170:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_2)). And then we should enliven phase 2, ([UB 170:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_3)), through this realisation of phase 1 (plenty of work here!), and that is what phase 3 , the supermortal brotherhood is waiting for.

Michael is already engaged in carrying out his plans, as we have seen. Clear evidence is also the fact of the assignment of Machiventa Melchizedek as Vicegerent Planetary Prince of Urantia. For an unnamed reason he has not yet assumed his office. But because we are free to speculate, I think this is because Urantia is not yet fully ready for it. Caligastia is hardly recognized in his sinister and nefarious actions, often not even among ‘Urantians’. But at least we could begin to try to realize what the acceptance of Melchizedek would imply, in this way preparing ourselves. Always the relatively few are the decisive factor, the vanguard.

Our fallen Lanonandek Son will be replaced by a Melchizedek, one of the order of the “eldest song of the local universe”, even more than a Constellation Father. “They are the teachers who so often win whole worlds of advanced life to the final and full recognition of the Creator Son and his Paradise Father.” ([UB 35:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/35#p2_7)) They are “understanding friends, sympathetic teachers, and wise counselors” and powerful!

And then on [UB 170:5.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p5_19) it is predicted: “Sooner or later another and _greater_ John the Baptist (not plural) is due to arise proclaiming the kingdom of God is at hand — meaning a return to the high spiritual concept of Jesus...” John the Baptist was the foreruner and herald of Jesus' bestowal. So this new and greater John the Baptist probably will be the forerunner of a new bestowal, as has been confirmed by the revelators. Such a great preacher may, through the present worldwide communicetion media, bring about a considerable change in the religious thinking of this world: “...such a restatement as will _undo_ the work of Jegus' early followers who went about to create a sociophilosophical belief regarding the _fact_ of Michael's sojourn on earth.” This is a mighty prediction: ‘To _undo_ the work of Jesus early followers’: (Underlining is mine) Don't read it superficialiy, just realize what this may mean in particular for the orthodox churches. And what does this mean for us, now? If such a spiritual revolution does take place, are we ready to assist in giving positive guidance to the confused? This event is not ages away:

Te have discussed sofar some of the references our book makes to the coming events, understanding students may find more. Let us study without prejudice. We are all somewhat prejudiced because we are not used to and prepared for _sudden_ events. “When physical conditions are ripe, _sudden_ mental evolutions may take place; when mind status is propitious, _sudden_ spiritual transformations may occur.” ([UB 65:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p8_6)) For us personally, the greatest transformation remains the growing and enlightening communion with the Father within, also when we direct our thinking to these subjects. This will provent inopportune human action. Remember, our greatest action is geeking, discovering, the Father's will, through value-realization. ([UB 196:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_2))

> “Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthreliing epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment.” ([UB 195:9.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_2))

We have already referred to the five phases of the kingdom, mentioned on [UB 170:4.2-6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/170#p4_2). Phase 4 is “The prospect of the more perfect fulfillment of the will of God, the advance toward the dawn of a new social order in connection with improved spiritual living — _the next age of man_. It should be noted that this phase follows on 3 : “The supermortal brotherhood of invisible spiritual beings which prevails on earth and in heaven, the superhuman kingdom of God.” The five phases show causal order. And on [UB 1704:15.par](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1704#p15_par) the midwayers continue: “although Jesus referred one phase of the kingdom to the future, (phase 4) and did on numerous occasions, intimats that such an sevent might appear as a part of a world crisis;...” I think we should give some attention to our attitude in such a crisis.

Jesus' attitude towards temporal upheavals or terrestrial cataclysma is depicted on [UB 176:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_2) “What does it matter to you who believe this gospel of the kingdom if nations overturn, the age ends, or all things visible crash, since you know that your life is the gift of the Son, and that it is eternally secure in the Father?” Jesus was very consistent. Eternal things are more real than temporal things. There is no real need to fear, though he understands our human reactions. His statement is psychologically and spiritually practical. It reminds me of wartime, when the bomber fleets from England used to roer above us on their way to Germany. It proved practical then to reckon with the worst that could happen, and then say: So what: It gave calm. Thus Jesus also brings up the worst that could happen: “all things visible crash.” I believe no crisis will take that extent, because there are so many passages in our book that make such an event highly improbable. What could a “demonstrator of righteousness” do when there are no more mortals to teach? But psychologically and spiritually it is sound to ponder. It is a challenge to our faith. Let us trust in our all-wise and merciful Father, and his ministers. Remember what has been said about providence. Providence works for the whole, for the group. If we individualiy are important for the spiritual welfare of other people, providence works. The best protection we can have is in being spiritually active and alert. And let it always be in our hearts: “Kingdom builders are not to be disturbed...”

There is so much we can do now for the fourth phase of the kingdom. Our invisible brothers of the kingdon are waiting for us. Let us put our spiritual imagination in action, in sonship with God. Peace-movements on the whole are active in the negative, anti-nuclear warfare, and so on. Our book shows us, in the Urmia lectures for instance, how we could be positively active in promoting world-govermment. Such a thing must always first become real in the minds of the few, and the more real it becomes for them, the more it will contaminate other people, because it is sound and positive. In this way, and many others we could prepare ourselves for ‘the next age’. And thus co-operste with our superiors. If we sincerely try to realize what changes will occur, this will bring ample opportunity for constructive thinking. What is needed is epiritual insight and universe-conscioweness, (which only comes after God-consciousness). But we could begin with universe-mindedness, willingmess to overcome prejudice from inertia and lack of imagination. And lack of belief in what has already been revealed of the plans of our Master. “God and men need each other”.

Bo of good cheer, it is springtime already?

## A Strategy To Beat The Odds

If the physical universe moves towards chaos... life itself is there to beat the odds. Thus, evolution among life forms occurs to adapt to chaos (changes) in the physical realm and win by replicating itself and carrying on the ‘eternal flame’. Consciousness and intelligence has evolved as one strategy to better best the odds.

Thought is a form of energy, but it is difficult to quantify the energy of thought. Nevertheless, thought can travel (epen) the vast distances of space in an ingtant. The apeed of light is like the speed of a microscopic flagollate in comparison. Does thought originate in our biocomputers (brains) or does it exist separately in the univerge?

As evolving intelligent creatures we become more discerning in picking up and perhaps transmitting thought. Such a powerful tool muat be used correctly, so books such as the Bible, the Koran, Bagavad Gita or the URArmI Book are blueprints or mapa for such use. Perhaps the best way to look at it is a bit analytical, in order to holp us keep one foot on arth while we in fact still here. I trust ‘God’ or 'the entire matter, energy and thought of the Superuniverses 100% of the time, I trust myse if an average of about 90-95% of the time, but never quite 100% because I an not able of myself to control all of my thoughts or actions. I cannot trust anyone more than myself and many pereons less than 50% of the time.

I think many concepts in our world should be looked at on a 50-50 basis, then there is less at tachment to the actions resulting from extreme and/ or views of such concepts. This does not mean that we should not act, but the attachment to the actions is in the centre.

_Editors Note: ‘God’ or 'the entire matter, energy and thought of the Superuniverses... Doesn't that sound a bit like a supercomputer? Jesus always taught that we can trust God, because in our personal expertence we can learn to know Him as a very loving, wise and caring Father of all personalities!_

## Compass and Square

M. Wilson

Life is university, death graduation. 
Are you ready for your career, 
Do you know your destination? 
Have you a map of the territory, 
Do you know your true will
or do you think life
is just time to kill.

## The Journey

Do you know where you are going, 
can you guess what you may find? 
Do you know the seeds you're sowing, 
or the waves you leave behind?

Through the circles you must travel, 
from the seventh to the first. 
All life's mysteries to unravel, 
and quench that all consuming thirst.

To satisfy the eternal yearning 
to be divine; it was the command. 
All the trying, all the learning 
are a part of that demand.

To Jerusem, from Urantia,
the seven mansion worlds are there. 
Leeding onwerd to Edentia, 
you'll be shown when and where.

Next Salvington, then Uversa, 
by now you'rs well on your way. 
Leave Orvonton, see Havona, 
you met the Ancients of Day.

Havona's worlds are one billion. 
By this time you're very wise, 
even if there were one trillion, 
you keep your eyes on Paradise.

Be ye perfect, said the Master, 
like your Father in heaven is. 
Face good fortune or disester, 
trust your spirit guides in this.

Spirit of Truth and Thought Adjuster, 
gift from Father, gift from Son. 
Mother Spirit, you can trust her, 
She comes forth from Infinite one.

Like a lighthouse in the dark night 
always pointing: That's the way.
For your soul they are the true light, 
that shines for you every day.

## Commentary On Scientific Statements In _The Urantia Book_ — Part IV

### The Origins Of Life

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that the firgt life implantations were made on this earth 550 million years ago, and that all subsequent living forms have evolved from these original implantations.

More and more one reads or hears on the television that life has existed on earth for as much as 3 billion years, which could set URANIIA Book readers wondering.

The fossil record shows us that life forms existed in the order of 500 to 600 milition years ago, and that these forms were relatively advanced at least in respect to their biochemical cellular orgenization. The intricacy of their skeletal remaing implies that they must have possessed the same highly complex system of information storage and the equally complex system for its translation into a living organism that we know about today. This system consists of the nucleic acids, RNA and DNA plus the enzymes, ribosomes etc.

The enormous complexity of this biochenical system that exists at the sub-microscopic level in every living cell is such that it is recognized, that for it to have evolved by some extraordinary set of spontaneous random events would probably take much longer than the subsequent evolution of the single cell organism to a full human being.

There are of course, many scientists who are unable to conceive that this complex system could have arisen by chance at all.

There are also those scientists who feel that the only scientific way of investigating such problems as the origin of life is to reject the idea of a creator or of life coming from somewhere in space. The thinking goes thus — since life is present on earth, it must be possible for life to put itself together spontaneously, the refore it did.

The evidence put forward by this group consists of laboratory experiments in which some of the complex organic chemicals found in living cells are shown to be formed through the agency of electric discharge (artificlal lightning), etc., on simple organic chemicals or even carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide. Also the fossil record is interpreted to indicate the existence of life forms up to about 3 bilition years ago.

One form of such fossil evidence is the finding of layered limestone structures called stromatolites in very ancient sedimentary rocks. Today stromatolites are still being formed and always in association with a microbial mat dominated by the photosynthetic cyanobacteria. Then very thin sections of ancient stromatolites are examined in transmitted light, structures can sometimes be observed that are interpreted to be fossilised sheaths of cyanobacteria that exhibit close morphological resemblance to living cyanobacteria. Photographs of these fossils are presented in the February 1984 issue of Scientific American, plus photos of acritarchs which will be discussed later.

To me it is a remarkable jump of the imagination to positively identify the rings and chains of rings shown in the se photos as the remains of cyanobacteria. However if they truly are photosynthetic cyenobacteria, we are faced with another dilema. These organisms have the highly complex DNA-RNA-protein synthesis system to ensure not only their orderly operation but the passage of information between generations. How could such a remarkable system evolve spontaneously during the chaotic first billion years of this planet's existence?

Passing on to the acritarchs, these are obtained by exposing ancient sedimentary rocks to treatment with strong acid and screening the remains for acid resistant organic structures. Photos are shown in the reference article and consist of spheres, and groups of spheres or hexagons that are interpreted as fossils of cells and cell colonies.

The jump of the imagination to equate these to current living organisms is quite large, and the statement that they are actual fossils of eukaryotes (organisms with an organized nucleus) is certainly not justified by the evidence presented. That they may resemble such organisms is not disputed, and I also accept that they are organic remains, though no analytical data are presented (i.e. what kind of biochemicals can be detected in these remnents. If DNA and protein could be detected, we would have a problem with interpreting _The URANTIA Book_ statements).

An interesting article appeared in the June 1985 issue of Scientific American that strongly disputes the more or less standard explanations presented for the origins of life by the followers of the organic soup theory ascribed to Oparin and Haldane. The author follows the line of reasoning that since life is on earth, it must have occurred spontaneousiy, then proceeds to develop the idea that the first primitive units of heredity, the genes, may have had their origin in crystaline clay minerals.

To me the idea has more mertit than the organic soup hypothesis, but still falls far short of giving a reasonable basis to the idea that a living cell could develop by spontaneous processes. The article shows a very interesting thing though, the occurrence of hollow tubes and spheroids in materials that are entirely composed of clay minerals. In the single photo presented, single spheroids, pairs of spheroids, chains of at least three spheroids and groups of many spheroids are clearly visible. Although their size is much smaller than for the acritarchs, it demonstrates that the mere occurrence of such structures does not necessarily signify life. Similarly leathery looking sheets with folds etc., which are shown in photos of the clay mineral called hallosite, resemble the folded surface of acritarchs shown in the firgt article.

Without wuch wore definitive evidence, I cannot accept that the structures formed in stromatolites and acritarchs unequivically represent DNA based living cells. But it does seem probable that they represent structural forms that are dominantiy organic.

There is no doubt the complex organic chemicals can be formed from simple organic molecules by processes other then those carried out by living cells. Many of these molecules are quite stable under the conditions of the surface of our planet and in the absence of living cells.

The organic soup theory assumes that such wolecules accumulated in the oceans and seas of the primitive earth over long period of time, and this seems to be a reasonable hypothesis. That spheroids, hollow tubes, and chains and groups of spheroids can occur spontaneously in organic clay minerals has been demonstrated. There is no reason to doubt that similar, and even more complex structures could form spontaneously from complex organic molecules, without the intervention of living cells. Boil milk, cool it and a skin will form without the intervention of life. We should not be surprised if skins (membranes) were formed in our primitive oceans, if spheres could form from such skins, and if these spheres could preferentially concentrate certain types of molecules. Reproduction of such spheres through budding is perfectly feasibie.

Protein is an essential component of living cells. Simple, small proteins can form spontaneously from their building blocks, the amino acids, and can then form into spheres which resemble a living cell. In tho laboratory of Sidney Fox, University of Miami, these proteinoid spheres have been artificially fossilised and then appear strikingly similar in size and structure to the fossils found in stromatolites. It is claimed that these proteinoid spheres emit an electrical response when exposed to light. Perhaps spheres of this type were the real catalysts that formed the ancient stromatolites, and not the cyanobacteria as currently propounded.

It is difficult for the non-scientist to appreciate the difference between Fox's proteins and microspheres and what exists in a real live cell. If we took the component parts of a very large bridge girder and welded them together at random, the resultant mess would have about as much resemblance to the real girder as Fox's proteins have to the proteins of living cells. If we repeated the process many thousands of times, heaped up the lot with bulldozers, and welded the pile together with bolts of lightning, the resulting structure would resemble the sydney Harbour Bridge about as closely as Fox's proteinoid spheres resemble a living cell.

What then is life, and what was it that the Life Carriers brought to Urantia 550 million years ago?

_The URANTIA Book_ includes bacteria and simple plant cells in what it calls life. Also it states that the first primitive life forms introduced into our seas carried all the information necessary for the eventual evolution of all subsequent life forms, including man without any further interference from the Life Carriers.

On [UB 65:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/65#p5_2) of _The URANTIA Book_ it states that certain primitive plant life forms reverted to the prechlorophyll types of parasitic becteria. This tells us that parssitie becteria preceded the blossoming of plant life which in turn provided the primary food source for subsequent animal life. On what then were these parasitic bacteria parasitic? Certainly not plant or animal forms, for they preceded them. If parasitic bacteria were the first life forms released by the Iife Carriers, there must have been a vast source of organic foodstuff which they could perasitise and which could sustain thea until photosynthetic plant life evolved.

Perhaps the fossil forms found in acriterchs and stromatolites were part of the organic soup on which the parasitic bacteria fad, and these forms were not “living” in the sense of the word used in _The URANTIA Book_. Intuitiveiy I conclude that such forms did not contain the self regulating, self replicating system based on DNA and protein synthesis found in all present day iiving cells, hence wers neither prokaryotic nor eukaryotic life forms. However, if by gome infinitely remote chance, DNA based, life forms did exist prior to 550 million years ago, we would have to ask what it was that the Life Carriers really did. Perhaps it could have been to re-arrange DNA and cellular orgenization and to confer upon such cells the necessary physical means, and the life force, to give them the potential to evolve eventualiy to the selfconscious, will-endowed creature we call man. If 30 , then perhaps the rearrangement of the DNA of eukaryotic cells into the system of exons and introns that know exists, was the work of the Life Carriers.

## Record Volume Of Library Placements

Late last year URANTIA Foundation donated 1200 copies of _The URANTIA Book_ to the library placement program of the Domestic Extension committee. As of April 30 , more than 900 of these books had been placed in libraries in the U.S. and throughout the world.

## Spanish Translation Begun

URANTIA Foundation has announced the conclusion of negotiations to begin tranglating _The URANTIA Book_ into Spaniah. The work is scheduled to be completed in 14 months from inception. Typegetting and production of a book from the completed translation will require some additional time Foundation staff has begun to plan the details of the operation, which will involve the support of dedicated readers in Spain, Bogota, and the U.S.

## Record Bppk Shipments Reported

During the year ending April 30, approximately 11,000 copies of _The URANTIA Book_ were shipped to readers and bookstores wordwide. According to John Hales, Resident Director, this unprecedented level of activity wes achieved even though extensive reorganization of headquarters operations occurred during the game period.

## 1987 Conference Plans Progress
