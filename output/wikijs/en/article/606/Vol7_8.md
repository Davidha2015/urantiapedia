## From The 6-0-6 Team

After the wany requests from readers for an article on the ‘Origin of _The URANTIA Book_’ we are happy to announce that we have obtained permission from Chicago to print their article on that subject.

The recent survey indicates that most readers do not wish to see a regular children's section in our Newsletter. After the poor response to last year's art competition, we have decided to shelve this project for the time being. We will review the situation again in the future. To all those people who have responded to our survey we like to say: Thank you for all your good ideas. We will try and fill the various needs of students of _The URANTIA Book_, specially those in isolated areas for whom the Newsletter is sometimes the only contact they have with other readers of the book.

Many thanks to all of you who have continued to support us in 1986 . Without your help we could not keep going.

All of us here at 6-0-6 like to wish you a safe and joyful Christmas and New Year and we look forward to communicating with you in 1987 .

## Task Of Newsletter Is Comunication

That contribution can specialist newsletter/magazines make to the world of literature?

Can they be a training ground for a T.S. Eliot or a Patrick White? Can they ‘break’ stories? Can they influence the established halls of learning? The answer in each case, based on historical evidence, is in the affirmative.

Since the late eighteen hundreds, European and American literature has been enhanced by small magazines. The antipodean colony of Australia waited until 1939 for a significant contribution to national culture with the arrival of ‘Southerly’. Another magazine ‘Meanjin’ was established the following year.

Specialist magazines encapsulate writings on a specific subject from the deluge of information available. They must allow rational assesement of their content and be capable of inteliigent self-criticism.

We do not publish for a popular audience. Rather do we direct our words to idealogical companions. But this voice, if worthy, will be heard afar in practical terms. It will be embraced as an antidote to the corrosive pressure of modern life and to that extent it offers absolute status to individual experience.

Without this expansion of appeal, small publications will not survive. The converted have no need to sustain their interest.

Educational magazinea, most notably in England, Canada and New Zealand are under threat due to reduced funding. Here in lies the other threat to survival. Subsidies offer precarious tenure. Market value ( by way of aubscription or donation ) is earned.

The task of our newsletter is communication. Its literary heritage, its historical value, is to be gained only in reflection, if at all.

## Mensa Embraces The Urantia Boor *

America Mensa, Ltd. is “a not-for-profit corporation of New York State” which consists exclusively of members who have IQs at or above a certain figure. (I do not know what that level 13.) Among their many activities, Mensa features “Speciai Interest Group” which are devoted to activities of all kinds relevant to a particular subject. Charles G. Schilling, SIG (Special Interest Group) Officer, sent a letter to Dan Amyx of Tampa, Florida, who had submitted _The URANIIA Book_ as a candidate for the focus of an official SIG. The first paragraph of that letter reads, “This will acknowledge receipt of your SIG Recognition Request, and inform you that your SIG, _The URANTIA Book_, is now recognized as a special interest group of American Mensa, Ltd. Announcement of the SIG's formation will appear in the Mensa Bulletin for April, 1986, and a listing will appear in the Sig Directory wich will be included in the September, 1986, edition.”

## _The Urantia Book_: The Question Of Origin *

Ken Glasziou

The question most frequently asked by people who have discovered _The URANTIA Book_ is “Would you tell me something about the origin of the book?” This general question is usually followed by a number of more specific inquiries. Such interest in the origin of a book as stimulating and challenging as _The URANTIA Book_ is natural. We have been conditioned by our culture to depend on sources and authority in evaluating publications of all kinds. This is especially true of religion.

Usually only a combination of tradition, social acceptance, and a firsthand knowledge of its quality will give the average person a satisfying answer concerning the origins of revelatory literature. Although Biblical scholars have declared that our knowledge of original New Testament documents is so meager, “We can now know nothing concerning the life and personality of Jesus,” most of us are not disturbed about the origin of historicity of the New Testament. The experience of centuries has validated its quality.

At this point in time there is no similar tradition of acceptance to give a “satisfying” answer to the origin of _The URANTIA Book_; someday, as its impact on civilization grows, there will be. Now the book must be evaluated solely on the basis of its quality — a personal experience of its internal authenticity or lack of it. _The URANTIA Book_ message must be experienced before one can evaluate its quality and consider the probability of the revelatory nature of its origin. Before you have completely read _The URANTIA Book_, therefore, it is impossible to give you a very satisfying answer concerning its origin; and, after you have read the book, someone else's comment about its origin, while of interest, is of secondary importance.

This problem of new readers, nevertheless, should not be ignored or answered in a cursory manner. Just as one who has experienced being in love can give an uninitiated friend some idea of this exalted state, so we will endeavor to share with you concerning the origin of _the URANTIA Book_. We well know, however, that this secondhand knowledge has severe limitationg in the authentication process and only a firsthand experience of the quality of the book can give an adequate answer to the question of origin.

First of all, let us acknowledge that no human being knows many of the details and specifics regarding the origin of the URANTIA papers. The most accurate information about the origin of the book is given by the revelators themselves. They candidly admit it is virtually impossible to translate the concepts of divinity and eternity into the circumscribed language and finite concepts of man. ([UB 0:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p0_2))

Those who bring the enlarged truth of revelation are further handicapped by the rigorous universe restrictions regarding imparting unearned knowledge. They are not allowed to anticipate scientific discoveries of the future. ([UB 101:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/101#p4_2)) To communicate effectively the revelators also must present teachings which are not too far removed from the thought and reactions of the age in which they are presented. ([UB 92:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/92#p4_1)) They realize we human beings like to proceed from the simple to the complex, but they know that spiritual wisdom is achieved only in a holistic setting, the understanding of the origin, history, and destiny of universe realities. ([UB 19:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/19#p1_6)) To compensate for these handicaps and limitations in communication, the revelators have used thousand of carefully selected human concepts to help them convey their message in our frames of reference. ([UB 0:12.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p12_12), [UB 121:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_13))

The actual composition of the URANTIA papers was assigned to three special commissions of universe personalities. Part I was formulated by a high commission of twenty-four orvonton (superuniverse) administrators headed by a Divine Counselor and was presented in 1934. Parts II and III were authorized by a Nebadon (local universe) commission of twelve, acting under the direction of Mantutia Melchizedek and were united in 1934 and 1935. Part IV was sponsored by a commission of twelve URANTIA midwayers acting under the supervision of a Melchizedek revelatory director.

After formulating a message designed to accomplish its divine purpose on our planet the next major task was to select a way to bridge communication between the spiritual levels of the universe and material mortals on our planet.

Necessary preparations for presenting the URANTIA papers to us was carried out by primary and secondary midwayers (beings quite close to us who can operate in both the spiritual and material worlds). It should be made clear, however, that the midway creatures are not involved in phenomena related to “spiritualism” or “mediumship” and they do not, ordinarily, permit humans to witness their contacts with the material world. ([UB 77:8.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p8_13))

Preparatory conditions were completed for presenting the URANTIA papers by making contact with a highly experienced and versatile Thought Adjuster of a human being on our world. It was through these cosmic adjustments that the URANTIA papers were materialized in the English language. ([UB 110:5.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p5_7), [UB 114:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p7_9))

Just what secondary midwayers did to materialize the papers we do not know. These details, no doubt, were wisely not given to us. The communication of spiritual truth is the main purpose of revelation and the spiritual beings who present revelation are wise enough not to get sidetracked by our natural human curiosity about associated phenomena which is beyond our current scientific knowledge. The revelators simply say on [UB 56:10.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/56#p10_23): “We indited these narratives and put them in the English language, by a technique authorized by our superiors...” They do not explain the details of this technique. We assume that in our ascent in the universe we will someday know something of the nature of this revelatory methodology. As for now, it is a “masterful mystery.” ([UB 87:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/87#p7_9))

Who the human being was whose versatile Thought Adjuster aided in bringing the fifth epochal revelation to our world will never be known because the revelators asked the fen people who knew to take a pledge of secrecy. They did not want any human beings to be mystically associated with _The URANTIA Book_.

It is amazing that the authors of the URANTIA papers tell us as much as they do. Upon reflection, you will recognize the persistent questions about the unrevealed “details” concerning the origin of the book as a psychological parallel to the reoccurring demand put to Jesus, “Show us a sign.”

No human beings determined the content of _The URANTIA Book_. The Divine Counselor who supervised Part I of the book says: “I am commissioned to sponsor those papers portraying the nature and attributes of God because I represent the highest source of information available for such a purpose on any inhabited world. I have served as a Divine Counselor in all seven of the superuniverses and have long resided at the Paradise centre of all things. Many times have I enjoyed the supreme pleasure of a sojourn in the immediate personal presence of the Universal Father. I portray the reality and truth of the Father's nature and attributes with unchallengeable authority; I know whereof I speak.”([UB 1:7.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p7_9))

Now let us turn to the human side of the story which may be interesting but has no spiritual significance. In preparation for presenting the papers of the fifth epochal revelation and placing them in the custody of a responsible group of human beings, the revelators made contact with a small group of people in Chicago. The leaders of this group were asked by the revelators not only to refrain from revealing the identity associated with the presentation of the papers, but also not to discuss details related to the arrival of the papers.

We will, therefore, never know just where or how the papers were received. Even these early leaders were puzzled; no human being knows just how this materialization was executed. The reason given for this request of secrecy is the revelators are determined that future generations shall have _The URANTIA Book_ wholly free from mortal connections. Human beings are often more concerned with unusual phenomena than spiritual reality. Since there are no “miraculous events” connected with human beings associated with the origin of the book, hopefully, future generations will be free from preoccupation with myths about it so that the message of _The URANTIA Book_ can shine in all its brilliance. The revelators want the fifth epochal revelation to stand on its own declarations and teachings. In spite of this care of the revelators to give us _The URANTIA Book_ unencumbered by the “egg shells” of its arrival, already there are dozens of strange apocryphal stories about its origin.

Permission was eventually given to publish the URANTIA papers. Special emphasis was placed on the evolutionary nature of the acceptance of new truth and the danger of being broadcast, indiscriminate, or revolutionary methods in presenting the message of the URANTIA papers. To carry out publication responsibilities, URANTIA Foundation was organized on Jan 11,1950, by a Declaration of Trust under the laws of the State of Illinois. URANIIA Brotherhood was initiated on Jan 2, 1955, and _The URANTIA Book_ was published October 12, 1955.

This account of the origin of _The URANTIA Book_, as we pointed out earlier, is not spiritually satisfying. Only a firsthand experience of the superlative message of the book can confirm the spiritual source of its origin. In reality, information about its origin has nothing to do with the truth or spiritual quality of the book. This must be judged by the reader on the basis of the content of the book. The message of _The URANTIA Book_ has amazing self-authentication. The indwelling spirit in wan affirms the everlasting truth of its message.

## John The Revelator

On [UB 47:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_2) _The URANTIA Book_ refers to John as “John the Revelator”. When we read the paper on the twelve apostles, on [UB 139:4.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/139#p4_14) the Midwayers tell us about John: “When in temporary exile on Patmos, John wrote the Book of Revelation, which you now have in greatly abridged and distorted form. This Book of Revelation contains the surviving fragments of a great revelation, large portions of which were lost, other portions of which were removed, subsequent to John's writing. It is preserved in only fragmentary and adulterated form.”

On this topic I would like to attempt to shed some light. In certain papers of _The URANTIA Book_ they quote from the Book of Revelation and this we may be able to piece together and understand something of the revelations that John had. When we read the Book of Revelation it becomes clear that in the visions John was having, he himself did not fully understand what he was beholding.

Before trying to find what pertains to the Book of Revelation in _The URANTIA Book_, I would like to give a Christian's view of the Book of Revelation taken from ‘The Good News Bible’: “The revelation of John was written at a time when Christians were being persecuted because of their faith in Jesus Christ as Lord. The writer's main concern is to give his readers hope and encouragement, and to urge them to remain faithful during times of persecution. Por the most part the book consists of several series of revelations and visions, presented in symbolic language that would have been understood by Christians of that day, but would have remained a mystery to all others. As with the themes of a symphony, the themes of this book are repeated again and again in different ways through the various series of visions. Although there are differences of opinion.regarding the details of the book, the central theme is clear; through Christ our Lord, God will finally and totally defeat all his enemies including Satan, and will reward his faithful people with the blessings of a new heaven and a new earth when this victory is complete”.

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that John Zebedee was “very closely associated with Peter in the early activities of the Christian movement, becoming one of the chief supporters of the Jerusalem Church”. After becoming Bishop of the Asian Churches, when he was ninety-nine he wrote the so called “Gospel According to John”. He died in A.D. 103 when he was 101 . Now let's continue with The URANPIA Book and try to see what it was that John beheld.

In the paper on the “Local Universe Mother Spirit” ([UB 34:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p4_11)) we read about the seven adjutant mind-spirits: “These are the ‘seven spirits of God’, ‘like lamps burning before the throne’, which the prophet saw in the symbols of vision. But he did not see the seats of the four and twenty sentinels about these sever adjutant mind-spirits. This record represents the confusion of two presentations, one pertaining to the universe headquarters and the other to the system capital. The seats of the four and twenty elders on Jerusem, the headquarters of your local system of inhabited worlds”.

> “But it was of Salvington that John wrote:‘And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices’ — the universe broadcasts to the local systems. He also envisaged the directional control creatures of the local universe, the living compasses of the headquarter world. This directional control in Nebadon is maintained by the four control creatures of Salvington, who operate over the universe currents and are ably assisted by the first functioning mind-spirit, the adjutant of intuition, the spirit of ‘quick understanding’. But the description of these four creatures called beasts — has been sadly marred; they are of unparalleled beauty and exquisite form.” [UB 34:4.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p4_12)

Then we turn to the paper on “The Seven Mansion Worlds”, on page [UB 47:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p10_2) we read: “John the Revelator saw a vision of the arrival of a class of advancing mortals from the seventh mansion world to their first heaven, the glories of Jerusem. He recorded: ‘And I saw as it wero a sea of glass mingled with fire; and those who had gained the victory over the beast that was originally in them and over the image that persisted through the mansion worlds and finally over the last mark and trace, standing on the sea of glass, having the harps of God, and singing the song of deliverance from mortal fear and death’. (Perfected space communication is to be had on all these worlds; and your anywhere reception of such communications is made possible by carrying the ‘harp of God’, a morontia contrivance compensating for the inability to directly adjust the immature morontia sensory mechanism to the reception of space communications.)”

In the paper on “The Morontia Life” ([UB 48:6.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_23)) we read something about how John had some of these visions: “You should consider the statement about ‘heaven’ and the ‘heaven of heavens’. The heaven conceived by most of your prophets was the first of the mansion worlds of the local system. Then the apostle spoke of being ‘caught up to the third heaven’, he referred to that experience in which his Adjuster was detached during sleep and in this unusual state made a projection to the third of the seven mansion worlds. Some of your wise men saw the vision of the greater heaven, ‘the heaven of heavens’, of which the sevenfold mansion world experience was but the first; the second being Jerusem; the third, Edentia and its satellites; the fourth Salvington and the surrounding educational spheres; the fifth Uversa; the sixth, Havona; and the seventh, Paradise.”

From this I think we could say that John had a vision of our system capital and also had a vision of parts of Salvington.

On page [UB 38:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/38#p2_5) _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that he also had an encounter with the great seraphim Loyalatia, for it is written: ‘And I John saw these things and heard them. And when I had heard and seen I fell down to worship before the feet of the angel which showed me these things. Then he said to me ’See thou do it not for I am thy fellow servant'. ([Rev. 22:8-9](/en/Bible/Revelation/22#v8))

In [Revelations 20:12](/en/Bible/Revelation/20#v12) John talks of the ‘Book of Life’ and _The URANTIA Book_ also speaks of the ‘Book of Life’; the resurrection of the survivors and the so called resurrection of the non-survivors. After reading chapter 20 it seems that John saw these resurrections. He also had a vision of the ‘four and twenty counselors’. On [UB 45:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p4_1) read: “At the centre of the seven angelic residential circles on Jerusem is located the headquarters of the Urantia advisory council, the four and twenty counselors. John the Revelator called them the four and twenty elders; ‘And round about the throne were four and twenty seats, and upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed in white raiment.’ The throne in the centre of this group is the judgment seat of the presiding archangel, the throne of the resurrection roll call of mercy and justice for all Satania.” John must have had a vision of the Lucifer Rebellion, for on page [UB 53:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p7_7) we read: “Of the planetary angelic helpers, those assigned to the Material Sons, about one third were deceived, and almost ten percent of the transition ministers were ensnared. In symbol John saw this when he wrote of the great red dragon, saying: “And his tail drew a third part of the stars of heaven and cast them down in darkness.”

The URANIIA Book quotes John again ([UB 53:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p5_6)) from [Revelations 12:4-10](/en/Bible/Revelation/12#v4): “There was war in heaven; Michael's commander and his angels fought against the dragon (Lucifer, Satan, and the apostate princes); and the dragon and his rebellious angels fought but prevailed not. This ‘war in heaven’ was not a physical battle as such a conflict might be conceived on Urantia.”

We also read on [UB 53:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p1_6): “The dragon eventually became the symbolic representation of all these evil personages. Upon the triumph of Michael, ‘Gabriel came dom from Salvington and bound the dragon (all the rebel leaders) for an age.’ Of the Jerusem seraphic rebels it is written: ‘And the angels who kept not their first estate but left their om habitation, he has reserved in sure chains of darkness to the judgment of the great day’.”

It seems like John also had a vision of the repercussions of the Lucifer Rebellion on Urantia — the Adamic default: ‘And she being with child, travelling in birth, and pain to be delivered.’ ([Revelations 12:2](/en/Bible/Revelation/12#v2))

John seemed to have had a series of visions into the future events of Urantia for in the paper on “Planetary Mortal Epochs”, a Mighty Messenger writes on page [UB 52:7.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/52#p7_11): “It was of the conclusion of the terminal mission of the Teacher Sons (at least that would be the chronology on a normal world) that John wrote: ‘I saw a new heaven and a new earth and the new Jerusalem coming dom from God out of heaven, prepared as a princess adorned for the prince.’”

That's most of the quotes I can find in _the URANTIA Book_ that have been taken from The Book of Revelations, so whet I would like to do now is to summarize John's visions from what we have. The Book of Revelations is wide open to interpretation, depending on the age, you could read it in a thousand different ways. My following summary stems from the facts, though parts of it are purely speculation, an attempt to fill in the missing parts.

I would surmise that John beheld some of the events that took place after Christ Michael became sovereign of Nebadon, had a vision into the past about the Lucifer Rebellion, and also seemed to have visions of some of the epochal events of our planet. It's as if John beheld and partially understood some of the past and future history of our planet. He talks of the ‘angels of the trumpets’ which _The URANIIA Book_ refers to on page [UB 114:6.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_8) as the “directors of the political performances of Urantia national life.”

Also on page [UB 114:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/114#p6_7) _The URANTIA Book_ borrows the term ‘angels of the churches’ from Revelations. It looks as if John had a vision of the beginning and the end of certain momentous events. This must have strengthened and comforted John greatly. I'm sure his Adjuster had the wellbeing of John in mind — after all he lived to be 101 .

You may find something interesting in Revelations. [Chapter 12](/en/Bible/Revelation/12) possibly about Eve, [chapter 4](/en/Bible/Revelation/4) about the four and twenty elders, [chapter 15:2](/en/Bible/Revelation/15#v2) about the ‘sea of Glass’.

## Six-0-Six Newsletter Survey

Reports of conferences are well done. Thank you and I have enjoyed Ken Glasziou's articles. I do read the whole Newsletter and it does do something to keep remote folk in touch.

What about a “Know your U.B.” regular with Q's and A's overleaf? That new revelations do people think they have? That have people's ‘T.A.’s been doing for them? Perhaps that's a bit hard! How to run a Study Group?

Christopher Billington, Tree, via Buchan

It is presented with a variety of different subjects, suiting everyone's wishes. I have the same interest as Ken Glasziou, in an article about the origin of _The URANTIA Book_, etc. Henk Engelsma, Thyalla Nth, SA.

Keep basic format as is. Allow 6-0-6 to evolve to meet needs as required without any sudden changes.

Neil Francey, Brisbane

I would like to see some aids and ideas to spread _The URANTIA Book_ and everything about its human origin in 1934 (because everybody is asking about $i t$ ). Your team is doing a great job! I am more thrilled than ever with the Big Blue Book!

## Say Hello to a Fellow Urantian

Since involvement with the publishing and mailing of the 6-0-6, I have become very aware of the great isolation of many readers in Australia. They have to cope with what Steve Shanahan named so aptly: “The tyranny of distance”.

So, when our family decided to drive to Cairns for our annual holiday, approx. 3500 ~km from Melbourne, I wanted to see some 6-0-6 readers on the way. Most of them were still only names to me, names I had been writing on envelopes. But I wanted to put personalities to those names.

Because in most places we only stayed one night and we never knew what day or time we were going to arrive, we had to pay most people surprise visits, just preceded by a short phone call.

Sometimes I only had a postbox number as was the case in Parkes, NSW. And with a name like Johnston, you can run into a bit of trouble. I tried all the Johnatons in the phone book, but had no luck.

“Do you receive a Six-0-Six Newsletter?” was my usual ( or was it unusual?) question. “A what?” would be the reply.

But after six days of travelling we were rewarded when an overjoyed Leslie Thackeray threw her arms around me and gave me a big hug. Some readers might recall that Leglie and her husband Jo ( both students from the URANTIA School in Boulder, Colorado) are cycling around Australia. (Yes, that's right, push-biking!) I was also delighted to meet another student from that school. Leslie's mother, the lovely Gwen Henzel, who had just arrived from USA. They are all staying on a farm about 10 km from a beautiful little tom in the tropical rainforest area of North quensland. The aboriginees have named this town ‘Kuranda’ or ‘Meeting place of the spirits’.

“Let's have a study group while we are here”, I suggested. “Good idea”. was the reply. Jo and Leslie had already done a lot of preparatory work in that direction. So, when one cool wat night we held our study group in the well-known 'Honeyhouse' in Kuranda, I was thrilled to see 5 new people who were interested in _The URANTIA Book_.

And what a study group it was! Although we had made some sort of plan as to what we were going to discuss, we very wisely decided that the best thing to do was to let the Spirit of Truth guide us in our endeavor to answer the many questions that were asked.

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia" alt="Tyranny of distance">
<img src="/image/article/606/distance.jpg">
</figure>

After a short introduction from Leslie, we read the first page of the Foreword. Jim, an American, was very interested in the evolution of the different races. Somehow we arrived at the very sensitive topic: “The unwise perpetuation of racially degenerate stocks” ([UB 99:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/99#p3_5)) This in turn led to Paper 72: “Government on a Neighbouring Planet” and the subject: “Dealing with Crime” ([UB 72:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/72#p10_1))

Other questions came up: “What about extraterrestrials?” Rodney, a guy from Montana, USA, wanted to know. This was an introduction to the four previous epochal revelations: The Dalamatian teachings, Adam and Eve, Melchizedek and Jesus of Nazareth.

“That about Jesus' second coming, what does _The URANIIA Book_ say about that?” was the question from Liam, a young chap from England. So we read “The return of Michael” ([UB 176:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p4_1)) and “The Yaster's second coming” ([UB 176:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p2_1)) “Why did Jesus call himself the Son of Man?” ([UB 126:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/126#p3_6)) “Who are the Midwayers?” ([UB 77:0.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p0_1) & [UB 77:6.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/77#p6_1)) We touched on Rodan of Alexandria. ( [UB 160:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_1) ) I introduced the subject of the Thought Adjuster, we covered the writing of the Gospels ([UB 121:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/121#p8_1))

We had a very interested audience. Three people intended to leave Australia in the near future and wanted to join study groups in the country they were returning to. Tanya wanted to visit the Boulder School. We advised them to get in touch with Chicago. The seeds were planted.

Cairns and Kuranda are metingplaces for peoples from all over the world. Young and rostless people who are searching for something. They flock to the market places, trying to sell or buy goods: T-shirts, jewellery, fresh bread, pottery, cakes and homemade biscuits, leather goods or fruit and vegetables, woodcraft, face painting, fortune telling, pot plants, paintings and music.

Jo and Leslie are right amongst them planting seeds of the fifth epochal revelation. In the short time that they have been in the area, they already have met quite a few of these young people. They told me they intended to display _The URANTIA Book_ next to the jewellery they planned to sell. (The book is a jewel of a different kind! )

After six days in Kurande we slowly heeded home again. When in Atherton we met Geoff Harper at The Tableland Growth Centre. I was greeted with a firm handshake and a warm smile. “I was just going to write to you people”, Geopl remarked. His work at the Centre keeps him very busy. As co-editor of the Tableland Growth Centre Newsletter he is involved wh organizing courses and workshops aimed at the development of human potential. They are a non-profit group unaffiliated with politics, churches or religious cults, offering wholistic solutions to the demands of the times. They have started to build a library. _The URANTIA Book_ and the Concordex occupied a very prominent position in Geof's office.

“A couple of times I have tried to form a study group, but at the moment I am back on my own”, he told me. He has been in contact with many different streams of philosophy and finds that he is getting more and more into _The URANTIA Book_. Those different philosophies very often serve as the necessary framework of concepts to graft this new revelation on to. Keep up the good work Geoff!

He also told me about the ‘Million Minutes of Peace’ and handed me a couple of cassettes to pass on to the study group in Melbourne.

One of them is a speech by Barbara Marx Hubbard called: ‘The Quantum Leap’.

I would like to give you a quote from an article in the Tableland Growth Centre Newsletter, by Bob Martin: “Her message is that we have reached a stage in time where an evolutionary leap in consciousness is possible, desirable, and necessary. Increasing numbers of people have, over the last 40 years or so, been attending educational institutions, both official and unofficial, both exoteric and esoteric, in an attempt to raise their personal levels of consciousness. We have, as a mass, succeeded. She feels, and I along with a great many other people, agree most enthusiastically with her, that now is the time for the ‘Hundredth Monkey’ effect to take place. The time for workshops is over. A ‘critical mass’ of humanity strong enough to swing the planet through its next evolutionary leap is now assembled and ready. All we need is a common point of focus and this she has given us with her tape.”

“The time period 12 noon to 12 midnight (GMT), 31 st December, 1986, has been selected for a mass planetary meditation of all caring people on earth to commence the shift.”

As we drove into the Gladstone business centre, my husband noticed a bookshop with the intriguing name: ‘Awakening Mind’. “That could be Kevin Meyrick's bookshop”, he said. Kevin attended the 1986 National Conference in Melboume. That's where wad met. I quickly went to investigate while my husband tried to find a parking spot, which is not easy when you are towing a camping trailer.

“You've come to the right place, replied a smiling lady. “I'm Kevin's wife Beryl. But Kevin is in Rockhampton today”. “That's just where we came from this morning”, I remarked, a bit disappointed.

We managed to catch up with Kevin at 7.30 the next morning. “We had a very small group in the past, but now I have to study _The URANTIA Book_ by myself again”, he told me regretfully. “I admit that I am not very good at introducing new people to the book”.

However I did notice that the book is displayed in his bookshop in such a way that people who like to browse, can easily find it. And that is very important!

We met Jo Hausler from Eumundi at 8 clock in the morning in the Nambour Caravan Park. I had rang Jo the night before and he had expressed that he would like to meet us. He found _The URANTIA Book_ about four years ago and is very enthusiastic about it. “I attended a workshop on ‘The Inner Voice’, given by an American lady who called herself ‘Crystal’,” Jo told me. “I wasn't very impressed with 'Crystal', but at that same workshop I met another lady from America, who owed _The URANTIA Book_”. Jo recognized what a treasure this book was and asked the lady if she would sell her copy, since he didn't know how to otherwise obtain one. Jo likes to share the teachings with other people. “This is what I give to people”, he said, as he handed me yellow sheet with some quotations from the book, which he had typed himself.

“This is great, but you can also write to Chicago for free pamphlets”. However I felt that the Master would be very pleased with Jo's own effort to spread this new revelation. “I would like to join a study group, but there is none in this area as far as I know”.

I could go on, but the story about isolation remains the same. There are quite a few readers in Brisbane, but still no study group. In my humble opinion what Queensland needs is a conference to bring people together and a pew able and wise leaders to form new study groups. Conferences can give one a sense of direction and there is a tremendous exchange of new ideas. Study groups can create wonderful friendships and definitely aids in the study of the book.

Since our return to Melbourne I received a survey from Robyn Hromek, 3 Blackall Ave, Blackall Pk, Newcastle. Robyn writes: “I feel very isolated here in Newcastle. I would love to have contact with URANTIA Book readers. Maybe those travelling Americans would like a holiday up here. I could give them food and lodgings for a visit!” Robyn, I hope someone will answer your call. Helen and Glen Stickley, M.S.142, Byfield, c/- P.0. Yeppoon, 4703, write: “Any travelling readers are welcome our way”.

But I advise people to rite first to make sure it is convenient.
