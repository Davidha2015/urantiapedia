## A Note From The 6-0-6 Team

In this newsletter, the first one for 1987, we like to welcome you all back after our summer holidays.

A little ad to see Neil Francey depart for Brisbane, we wish him and his family all the best in his new venture. Neil, who for many years has been one of the torchbearers for the URANTIA movement in Australia was the original editor of the Six-0-Six Newsletter, which is entering its eighth year of publication. No doubt, he will continue to serve his fellowmen, not. only in his hometown Brisbane, but also in his new role as a member of the international fellowship committee.

Because of everyone's input, Six-0-Six is becoming a dynamic newsletter. As a result of your (the reader's) replies to last year's survey, cogs have started to turn.

Mike Taylor, Jo Hausler and Ken Glasziou asked for articles on the origin of _the URANTIA Book_. We got permission to publish: ‘_The URANTIA Book_: The question of origin’

Since then we have written to Meredith Sprunger to allow us to publish his pamphlet: ‘The Origin of The URANTIA Bock.’ Not only did Meredith give us the o.k., but to sent we another article: 'God's Presence in Action'. Christopher Billington asked us for an article on how to run a study group. We were able to obtain a few articles on that subject. One by Henri Begemann and one by Peter Webb.

Stephen Theiler requested something on astrology and Mark Blackham responded to his request.

Georg Sepp mentioned reincarnation. We found an article by Richard Bain: ‘The Wheel of Karma’. So you see, it is not just the few of us here who put the 6-0-0 together, but all of us are vital to the birth of this newsletter. It is not given to everyone to write lengthy articles, but your ideas are picked up by others who have got the talent to put their thoughts on paper. So keep up the good work. Even a few lines are important to us ell. You are in for some inspiring reading this year!


## Thought For The Month 

> “Man can find the love of God without facts, and man can discover the laws of God without love, but man can never begin to appreciate the infinite symmetry, the supernal harmony, the exquisite repleteness of the all-inclusive nature of the first Source and Centre until he has found divine law and divine love and has experientially unified these in his own evolving cosmic philosophy.” (_The URANTIA Book_ [UB 111:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_6))

## Looking Forward To New Adventures

With our departure from Melbourne we felt that indescribable mixture of foy and sorrow.

We leave our wonderful times and friends and take with us the treasured memories. We look

forward to our new adventures in Brisbane and trust many visitors from Melbourne (and elsewhere) will drop in.

Our very best wishes go to everyone involved with 6-0-6. I guess there is no-orfe who hasn't assisted in its creation. We've all shared a role.

Naturally enough we'll greatly miss the good

times, the hassles, the deadlines, the layouts that wouldn't quite work', and the interesting mail. So good luck to the team who work so diligently on it. It is poised for great work as it gains the increasing support of readers. And now that's me. A reader. What fun it will be receiving it in the mail. Can hardly wait.

Nail Francey, Brisbane

## From The Perth Study Group

Concerning study groups, I do have a few ideas. These, of course, come from a very limited background. My wife and I have only been involved in one study group. No doubt our thoughts on the subject could be well expended by meeting other groups. The comments I make are not those of our group, though at times we have all discussed how to best deal with our time together.

At each meeting, which is fairly informal, we try to achieve three main objectives. Firstly and most importantly, is the reading of _The URANTIA Book_. Comments are welcome. This sometimes leads to insights which we in our personal reading could overlook. When the meeting first starts, the talk revolves around _the URANTIA Book_ and what we have been doing. A few topics are talked about until one is selected. The topic chosen is relevant to the mood of the group. Secondly, we attempt to define and work towards group goals. Such things as attracting new members, the book booth and other group projects. Thirdly, we discuss individual roles. Our personal ministry in bringing others to the book. Also any problems we have are often discussed in relationship to the book.

We have at this time no planned group worship. Occasionally a prayer is read out of _The URANTIA Book_, but worship is most times left with the religious conviction of each individual.

Peter Webb, Yanchep, WA.

Dear 6-0-6

I believe there are some other URANTIA Book readers around this Gold Coast area. I would like to contact them, maybe we can form a study group if distance is not too great. Anyone travelling by this way is quite welcome to call in. Hope to hear from anyone interested in the URANTIA movement. I have been a reader now for 16 years.

Dear 6-0-6,

I loved reading your article ‘Say hello to a fellow Urantian’. I actually felt part of the whole scene.

That's a grand idea for December 31st. I did enjoy Trevor Swadling's ‘John the Revelator’. It makes me want to re-read ‘Revelations’ and do some comparisons of my own.

Shirley Legge, Melbourne

## Counterfeit of Lucifer?

I am inclined to think that _The URANTIA Book_ could be a counterfeit of Lucifer (Satan). can you send me an argument for _The URANTIA Book_ as true and God-inspired as I believe the Bible is.

Queensland reader

_Editor's note: This reader received a personal reply to his comments after our July/Aug Survey._

Dear 6-0-6

Thanks for sending us your newsletter. I of ten don't find a chance to get out _The URANTIA Book_ and your snippets are often a great revelation to me.

Helen \& Glen Stickley, Byfield, Qld.

## From The Netherlands

Thank you for your kind letter. I am happy my article ‘Springtime’ was so well received. I myself think it an important article because it makes us alert for the signs of the times. We live “on the brink” of tremendous changes.

You wrote about isolated readers. We had the same problem in England and we started a monthly study-letter, kind of a study group by letter. I gave comments and asked questions about a paper (112), and sent it to a London reader, who photocopied them and distributed them to readers all over England.

Our experience with that method was that certain people valued them highly, but other people gave little feedback. There are more people who like to read the book, than really study it.

How to run a study group is a question often discussed. As you wrote, there are no hard and fast rules. But I can say how we do it here. We meet every other week for the simple reason that, although once a week would be better, I have no time for that. The translation of the book into Dutch takes quite a lot of my time. Besides we have seven study groups here that have me as the leader. I cannot do more. But two members to one of these groups now also have their own groups, of which they are the leaders. A third one is in the making. So it grows.

Another feature of our groups is that we ell sit around a table, with the book, or the translation, on the table. We have discovered that such physical nearness fosters spiritual brotherhood and friendship. Attendance is very regular.

A meeting has two parts. In the first hour we discuss a paper (mostly from the Jesus Papers) that the members as their homework have studied before coming to the meeting. In the second hour we read together, especially the more difficult papers from the first pert of the book. We read slowly, punctuated by questions, comments, etc. Mostly we read no more than one or two pages. In this way it becomes difficult to peruse the whole book, but the homework institution compensates for that.

Always remember that it is not quantity that counts, but quality, understanding and insight.

A difficulty is the point of leadership. Our book says that the future of such a group depends for a large part on leadership. It is what is lacking to a great extent in the URANTIA movement. Someone who desires to be a leader often is not a good leader. A leader is somebody who tries to conquer ego and to serve.

Henri Begemann, Wassenaar, The Netherlands

## A Matter Of Priorities

All the years of reading bedtime stories to the children, must have left a lasting impression behind. The first thing that came to mind when I started to think about the subject of priorities was: ‘The three little pigs’. The third little pig in Walt Disney's cartoon certainly had an air of solidity about him. With his blue pair of overalls and cap, putting bricks upon mortar, slap, slosh, slap. He didn't mind a hard day's yakka. And he was pretty generous too, you must admit. For apart from telling his brothers: “I told you so”, when their flimsy shelters fell down, the first time that big, bed wolf was doing his deep breathing exercises, he did invite them in. And you couldn't exactly say: “All work and no play, makes Jack a dull boy”. For once he built his house, he did enjoy himself at the party they had, when they nearly finished up with roast wolf for supper. But I wonder how tolerant he was of those two lazy brothers, once he discovered that they were too weak to carry their dirty dishes to the dishwasher, and left their muddy socks lying under the bed. I hope he was wise enough to give them a gentle push out of the door again, when that wolf with the roast buttocks left the neighborhood. For how else could they ever. learn to stand on their own two wobbly trotters?

It was all a matter of priorities. I wonder how right we have our priorities, when it comes to eternal survival. How much time do we spend on satisfying our physical needs?

A Solitary Messenger of Orvonton gives us the following comment: “I cannot but observe that so many of you spend so much time and thought on mere trifles of living, while you almost wholly overlook the more essential realities of everlasting import, those very accomplishments which are concerned with the development of a more harmonious working agreement between you and your Adjusters. The great goal of human existence is to attune to the divinity of the indwelling Adjuster; the great achievement of mortal life is the attainment of a true and understanding consecration to the eternal aims of the divine spirit who waits and works within your mind.”" ([UB 110:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_4))

Sometimes I imagine that at the end of the day we hand to our Thought Adjuster a bag of goodies, which are the accomplishments of the day. The Adjuster looks inside this bag, where it is very dark. He can only see the things with a neon-coating on them. They are the things with survival value for our soul. These are the things that he relativizes or duplicates for us. The rest is discarded.

When Martha complained to Jesus that her sister Mary wasn't pulling her weight, Jesus answered: “Martha, Martha, why are you always anxious about so many things and troubled by so may trifles? Only one thing is really worth while, and since Mary has chosen this good and needful part, I shall not take it away from her. But when will both of you learn to live as I have taught you: both serving in co-operation and both refreshing your souls in unison? Can you not learn that there is a time for everything — that the lesser matters of life should give way before the greater things of the heavenly kingdom?” ([UB 162:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/162#p8_3))

Although I am aware that certain philosophies tell us that time is only an illusion, a Mighty Messenger of Uversa tells us that “Time is a vital factor in everything this side of Havona and Paradise.” ([UB 28:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_10))

I wonder what your opinion is on the following old English nursery rhyme: “Little Boy Blue, come blow up your horn. The sheep's in the meadow, the cows in the corn. Where is the boy who looks after the sheep? He's under the haystack, fast asleep.” Unless that Little Boy Blue was awake with a toothache all night, I think that he had no business to be asleep under the haystack, while the cows were munching that precious corn, which was meant for the family's winter supply. Had he been dancing the night away?

That same Mighty Messenger has this to say about time: “Time is the one universal endowment of all will creatures; it is the “one talent” intrusted to all intelligent beings. You all have time in which to insure your survival; and time is fatally squandered only when it is buried in neglect, when you fail so to utilize it as to make certain the survival of your soul.” ([UB 28:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_9))

And now we are on the subject of souls, here is another English nursery rhyme: “Old King Cole was a merry old soul, and a merry old soul was he. He called for his pipe, he called for his bowl, and he called for his fiddlers three.”

Do not think that I am begrudging that old king his pipe and his bowl, for let's face it, the poor man had to have some way to relax. He was probably lying awake at night, trying to think up a new tax scheme, so he could pay for the workers compensation of his three fiddlers. plus the extra loading on top of their holiday pay. Not to forget the double time they charged after 11.00 p. m. every time they had a party at the palace.

No, I agree with the Solitary Messenger who says: “But a devoted and determined effort to realize eternal destiny is wholly compatible with a light-hearted and joyous life and with a successful and honorable career on earth. Co-operation with the Thought Adjuster does not entail self-torture, mock piety, or hypocritical and ostentatious self-abasement; the ideal life is one of loving service rather than an existence of fearful apprehension.” (1206:2)

There is a time to work. But the question is if our work is a means to an end, or is it, or the money we earn with it, an end in itself.

Jesus had no objection to the possession of wealth, only to the love of wealth. “Man may not share his supreme loyalty to a spiritual ideal with a material devotion.” (1803:1)

There is a time to play. “All efforts to obtain wholesome diversion and to engage in uplifting play are sound; refreshing sleep, rest, recreation and all pastimes which prevent the boredom of monotony are worth while. Competitive games, storytelling, and even the taste of good food may serve as forms of self-gratification.” ([UB 84:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_5)) But we are also reminded that: “The hunger of the soul cannot be satisfied with physical pleasures ([UB 84:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_4)) “Man has well earned some of his present-day joys and pleasures. But look you well to the goal of destiny!” ([UB 84:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/84#p8_6))

There is a time for everything. It is just a matter of what comes first.

## Dear Six-0-Six Readers,

I just got through reading the Conference 1986 report in Vol, No 6, July August 1986 issue of the 6-0-6 and had to write to you.

I read the report with great joy and interest. Joy at the wonderful activity and at seeing how dear friends met and interest because I have met so many of you and at finding out what you are doing with _The URANTIA Book_ in your lives. I have talked to Berkeley Elliott, John Hales, and Tom Allen about their trip and know they had a wonderful time there. It meant so much to Philip and I to see this kind of exchange after so many years.

For those of you who don't know us, we lived in Mackay, Q1d. for three years, 1975-78. We travelled much and spent as much time as we could in Neil francey's company. We felt so strongly then, (and continue to feel the same) that Australians had to turn fellow Australians onto _The URANTIA Book_ and decide how they would meet, study, fellowship and organize themselves. You have obviously been doing just that in the intervening years. I know that many of you have met over the years and that there have been conferences previous to this one, but this one had the added dimension of Berkeley, John and Tom being there who could report back on a large scale here to U.B. readers of what the activities in Australia are. All of the news up to now has been second hand via Six-0-six, Julia Fenderson's correspondence and our correspondence. I'm thrilled really at this new outreach.

I'm even more thrilled at Neil Francey's appointment and acceptance to the International Fellowship Committee of the URANTIA Brotherhood. He will be able to contribute so much. I don't know who wrote the report but thank you. It was informative and what humor! Having met some of you I could share in the enthusiasm, wit, and candor. You are right “conferences are about people”. Then any of you come to Maine in August 1987? I have fond memories of my time in Australia and studying _The URANTIA Book_ with people there; and of meeting Kevin, Trevor, Peter Toy, and William Wentworth in the states.

I look forward to a time when we can travel to Australia and fellowship with you again in person. For now I will have to contend myself with correspondence, and the wonderful.

Six-0-Six Newsletter.

Till then, keep up the wonderful work of exchanging ideas and love and know that we in the states look with great warmth at what you are doing with _The URANTIA Book_ and its teachings in Australia!

With much love to you all, Jane Rolnick, Durham, NC, USA

## That Monthly Message Of Inspiration

This excellent eight page newsletter is a real credit to the man behind it: David Glass. Last year David invited 6-0-6 readers to ask for a free issue of his publication.

His address is: David Glass, 5885 Chesapeake Place, Fort Worth, Texas, 76132 USA.

JOHN THE REVELATOR

I was very much interested in Trevor's article about“John the Revelator”. He helps us all by collecting all that about John's vision and putting it in an article.

The following change in the Standards of Admission fOr URANTIA Societies es recommended by the Charter Committee was approved: the period of time an applying study group must have met together prior to application was shortened from five (5) to three (3) years.

GOD'S PRESENCE IN ACTION

You recall Jesus' parable of the two sons, the first son when asked to work in the vineyard refused but later thought the better of it and went to work. The older son when asked to work replied, “Yes, father, I'll go,” but after his father left did not fulfill his promise. ([UB 173:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/173#p3_1)) On another occasion Jesus said, “Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ shall enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who does the will of my Father in heaven.” ([Matt 7:21](/en/Bible/Matthew/7#v21)) The acid test of life is in our actions. The real nature of our faith is seen in our behaviour. “True religion must act... Always and ever religion does something; it is dynamic.” ([UB 102:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_8)) “There is no real religion apart from a highly active personality.” ([UB 102:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/102#p2_7)) “The weak engage in resolutions, but the strong act.” ([UB 48:7.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_13))

Action is creative and effective when we are in touch with reality, when God is a partner in our life and work Jesus orients his universe sons and daughters saying, “Remember: I am the real vine, and you are the living branches. He who lives in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit of the spirit and experience the supreme joy of yielding this spiritual harvest... Herein is the Father glorified: that the vine has many living branches, and that every branch bears much fruit.” ([UB 180:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p2_1)) How does this come about; how do we become living branches which bear much nourishing and enriching fruit?

A creative relationship with that which is substantial and real begins when we come to the realization that egocentricity is psychological poison which leads to an unfulfilled and unhappy life and we insightfully and wholeheartedly dedicate ourselves to God and his purposes for our lives. This unique and personal divine plan is then discovered by meditating on the creative urges deep within us — sorting, organizing, and integrating these sincere longings and singular personality gifts. Under the guidance of the spirit they materialize into vital projects and eventually take the form of a life plan. This plan, this sense of calling, gives' meaning and purpose to our lives and with it a new source of energy and strength.

The real substance and character of our lives begins when we actualize these creative urges in specific projects of living. We grow and contribute to ourselves and others only when we act. Our early ancestors, Andon and Fonta, longed to transcend the limited potentials of their primate associates but the future of the human race was not assured until they summoned the courage to act, to flee from their animal cousins and face the rigors of a hostile world. With this act of courage came the serendipitous discovery of fire and the actualization of potentials far beyond their imagination. So always is spirit inspired action the ancestor of unexpected discoveries and unforeseen accomplishments. “The act is ours, the consequences God's.” ([UB 117:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p5_5))

Such action, however, is never easy. Spirit indited tasks push us to our limits. “The religion of the spirit means effort, struggle, conflict, faith, determination, love, loyalty, and progress.” (1729) with experience, discipline, and productivity we ascend the psychic circles of personality growth and with this accrued wisdom our lives become more effective and we grow more real as persons. This service-action life and its resultant growth prepare us for greater projects in the future. But even now there are many avenues of kingdom work challenging us.

We have in the fuller restatement of the life and teachings of Jesus the greatest spiritual message of our planet. Dur world needs to hear this inspiring good news. Once again we need evangelists like King Asoka who trained and sent out thousands of missionaries whose devoted labour in twenty-five years won half of the world to a higher expression of spiritual truth. Our world languishes for great music compositions which, will transform our spirits and noble literature that will inspire us to better ways of living. The fifth epochal revelation requires new religious fellowship which will spread throughout the world with a fresh, inspiring spiritual symbolism and an advanced ethic of love which will promote understanding, brotherhood and unity among the diverse institutions and peoples of the world. The URANTIA movement awaits visionary entrepreneurs and architects who will set aside tracts of land and construct retreat areas, educational facilities, and worship centres. These and thousands of other tasks and projects are vibrant opportunities for actualization by those who are willing to respond to the spiritual renaissance now being ushered in on the wings of the future.

In whatever direction our life plan may take us, it is the fruits of the spirit that undergird our work and make it effective for time and eternity. These fruits of the spirit are “loving service, unselfish devotion, courageous loyalty, sincere fairness, enlightened honesty, undying hope, confident trust, merciful ministry, unfailing goodness, forgiving tolerance, and enduring peace.” ([UB 193:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p2_2)) These are the marks of God's presence in action whether our work is in the material, mental or spiritual realms of human activity.

As pioneers of the new age our work is of crucial importance. The messengers of the fourth epochal revelation were very ordinary human beings and yet their witness to new spiritual truth turned the world upside down. Jesus told his apostles that as they serve in the Father's kingdom they would also do the work that he was doing and even greater works would they do because he was returning to the Father ([John 14:12](/en/Bible/John/14#v12)) and his universe sovereignty and the new gift of the spirit of truth would magnify their effectiveness. Add to this spiritual power base the dynamic of the fifth epochal revelation and the potentials of this spiritual partnership between man and God stagger the imagination. Pioneers in a new age, however, need to have the personality stamina to serve without seeing results. Indeed, the immediate effect of innovative work is usually disapproval and opposition. Nevertheless, as we pursue our work in partnership with God we know that we are making effective contributions to civilization and culture, that we are adding functional realities to our planet and the realm of the supreme.

Not only is work on the frontiers of progress often frustrating and rigorous, it is unpredictable. Serving in partnership with God requires flexibility. Often our human and personal hopes and purposes which we have planned and cherished for years are shattered on the rocks of evolutionary reality and transmuted into the larger and wiser objectives of spirit determination. Sometimes we are constrained to do things which we would most wish to avoid. Like Moses who lacked public speaking abilities was, nonetheless, required to become a speaker and teacher, so we of ten find it necessary to engage in activities where our talents are marginal. The important thing is that we are sensitive to the leading of the spirit and have the courage to act in conformity with that guidance. Ours is the responsibility to act; the results are in larger hands. And history demonstrates that God can use very mediocre talent to accomplish great things. “Service... more service, increased service, difficult service, adventurous service, and at last divine and perfect service... is the goal of time and the destination of space.” ([UB 28:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_17)) It is through such service that we human beings fulfill our deepest needs and longings, discover happiness, and come closest to greatness.

The presence of God is most effective experienced in action — service. Our lives find meaning and purpose through action. Seldom have the people of this planet had greater opportunities for significant service which will effect future generations than now. Let us unite in spreading the message of the fifth epochal revelation which promises to precipitate one of our world's “most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment.” (2082) And I would now ask you, even as I ask myself: What are you doing to contribute to this new age?
