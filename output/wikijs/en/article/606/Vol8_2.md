## Editorial

In October this year Sydney will host the national conference and plane are on the way for — South Pacific conference in October 1988.

It is perhaps a good idea to discuss the subject of conferences, and in particular the Pacific Conference, more openly through the Newsletter. Up till now conferences in Australia have been relatively small. We never had more than 40 people attending. But now we are looking at the possibility that our oversea visitors will outnumber us. That is fine. But have we got the resources, manpower and accommodation to cope with this? When people spend so much to come to Australia, surely they will want to stay a little longer than just the two or three days of the conference. They will want to 888 more of our country and our people.

In a meeting last October which was held in Melbourne and which was attended by about 15 people, it was discussed that other states apart from N.S.W should host our overseas guests. But we will have to coordinate this properly.

As we look to the future we are asking ourselves if big conferences are what we went and need. Does Australia want to take the direction of the U.S., where conferences are becoming so big that they need committees to advise other committees? Let's be honest. At this stage we haven't got the manpower to do it. Sydney's study group has about 4 or 5 people in it. If we invite overseas guests, we would like to give them the time and attention they deserve. Over the past years several URANTIA Book readers from overseas came to Australia. They travelled around this vast country of ours, stayed with families and got to know and love the Aussies. Our doors are always open, but perhaps it would be better if they spread their visits out a little more instead of all coming to one conference. We don't need large groups of people to take action as was proven by the Perth Study Group. There are only a handful op students up there, but they sowed the seeds of this new revelation in the hearts of many people who walked by their Book Booth in January this year. We Aussies are just as good in making decisions around the barbecue as around the conference table. We are all for international fellowship, but let it start in our homes and with our families instead of around the conference table. People don't have to wait for a conference to come to the land down under. Our Aussie spirit of love and hospitality is alive today!

## “Thought for the month”

> “What a travesty upon the infinite character of God! this teaching that his fatherly heart in all its austere coldness and hardness was so untouched by the misfortunes and sorrows of his creatures that his tender mercies were not forthcoming until he saw his blameless Son bleeding and dying upon the cross of Cavalry!”
> 
> “But the inhabitants of Urantia are to find deliverance from these ancient errors and pagan superstitions respecting the nature of the Universal father. The revelation of the truth about God is appearing, and the human race is destined to know the Universal father in all that beauty of character and loveliness of attributes so magnificently portrayed by the Creator Son who sojourned on Urantia as the Son of Man and the Son of God.” (The URANTIA BOOK [UB 4:5.6-7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p5_6))

## The First Australian Urantia Book Booth

(Australia Day Weekend, 1987)

This event was a historical precedent for _The URANTIA Book_ in Australia and for our dedicated group of readers in Perth.

The Matilda Festival is a yearly occurrence in Perth, and is known for its cultural, spiritual and educational displays. One can expect to see interesting display booths by: The Baha'i faith, The Summit Lighthouse, The Right To Life Association, Hare Krishna and Dianetics — with free personality tests. _The URANTIA Book_ booth was nestled within these groups and sects, and yet it was obvious that we weren't the blue and white club, presenting yet another sect to the world. We appeared as an information booth, and as participants, we were united in our efforts to give _The URANTIA Book_ public exposure. This was a national effort on the part of the URANTIA movement, as we, the Perth study Group, were ably helped by Kathleen and Trevor Swadling of Sydney and Steven Shanahan of Melbourne.

Over 300 pamphlets were taken by interested passersby, many who engaged in discussions with us on the nature and origin of the book.

The greatest thing which emerged from the booth experience was that of group identity. Dur once private study group was exposed to public attention. and we were very well received. There also developed an excellent camaraderie between us and the other participating booths; which reminded me a bit of Cymboyton's school of religions at Urmia.

The Urmia religionists lived together in comparative peace and tranquility because they had fully surrendered all their notions of religious sovereignty. Spiritually, they all believed in a sovereign God; socially, full and unchallengeable authority rested in their presiding head — Cymboyton. They well knew what would happen to any teacher who assumed to lord it over his fellow teachers. “There can be no lasting religious peace on Urantia until all religious groups freely surrender all their notions of divine favour, chosen people, and religious sovereignty. Only when God the Father becomes supreme, will men become religious brothers and live together in religious peace on earth.” ([UB 134:4.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/134#p4_10))

I recommend all study groups throughout Australia to organize an URANTIA book booth. It is a great service to the community, not only to let them know that you are a believer in _The URANTIA Book_, but to sow seeds that will eventually enrich and enlighten all humanity.

## The Question of Astrology

Looking forward to an enjoyable and thought provoking newsletter in the now year. Would love to hear about others' news and experiences regarding Astrology and Reincarnation in the light of _The URANTIA book_'s understandings on these subjects. They have particularly been a question mark for me as I have been impressed by the accuracy of Astrology in my own personal experience and also with reading of other people's experiences of reincarnation. Thank you for all those involved in putting out the Six-0-Six Newsletter.

Stephen Theiler, Melbourne

At the time we received this letter, we were fortunate enough to have an URANTIA Book reader from British Columbia, Canada staying at 6-0-6 headquarters. Mark Blackham was so kind to answer Stephen's letter speaking from his own personal experience.

Dear Stephen,

It was a pleasure to read your recent letter to the 6-0-6 newsletter. I am writing in reply to your question regarding astrology as viewed in the light of _The URANTIA Book_. I can only reply from my own experience and my heart and sincerely hope I have been of service to you.

As a onetime ardent student of astrology for a number of years, I too found many of the interpretations of the positions and juxtapositions of the stars and planets to ring true in my personal experiences and feelings. At times many of the predictions and analysis of character appeared uncanny. I sincerely felt and hoped that I had finally discovered a means of explaining many things I could not understand about myself and others. And yet, as much as I studied the subject, it could not completely dispel my yearning for truth. Still an empty hole persisted in my heart. An astrological analysis of events, myself and others could not fill this vacancy of truth which pleaded to be occupied. Something was missing.

It was around this time that I tripped over the greatest discovery of my life, _The URANTIA Book_. Upon reading the book for the first time, I too was not only amazed and thrilled at its message, but like yourself, was a little disappointed and confused as I read sections of the book which shattered many beliefs and concepts I had previously held. Nevertheless the messages of _The URANTIA Book_ began to fill to overflowing that vacant hole in my heart. Messages such as — There is a God — He does love me — I am one of His sons — it is a friendly universe — He wants me to join Him. These concepts and this kind of knowledge far exceeded any truth I had previously encountered in any study of any thing.

My new understanding of God and the universe led me to become aware that such a God of fatherly love would not so cruelly peg the changing character and fate of one of His sons to the positions of the stars and planets. _The URANTIA Book_ taught me, and I now believe wholeheartedly, that Jesus is a Creator son of cod. And one of Jesus' admonitions to us all was ‘Be you perfect, even as your father in heaven is perfect’. Although we may never achieve perfection on this world, it must certainly be possible in the worlds to come. Otherwise Jesus would not have given us such a seemingly impossible mission. And, if such is the case then we are truly free of the fetters of astrology which bind us to a particular type of character, to certain circumscribed abilities and limits of achievement. We are truly free! Our only guide is His Spirit and His endless love, perfection our potential goal.

I can only advise you to read on Stephen, feel the Spirit within, prepare yourself for a transformation beyond your imagination.

Mark welcomes any correspondence from 6-0-6 readers.

## When Was Michael's Crucifixion Date?

It is sometimes interesting to see how close Science is getting to the truth. Take for instance the debate about the correct date of the crucifixion.

Colin J. Humphreys and W.G. Waddington of Oxford University in England have come to the conclusion that it must have been on Friday, April 3, A.0.33. If you know your URANTIA Book dates, you might say: “But that is wrong.”

I know, but if you follow their reasoning, you will see how close to the truth they came.

This is how they have calculated the date of the crucifixion:

Most Christians would agree that Jesus was crucified under Pontius Pilate. His procuratorship in Judea lasted from A.D. 26 to 36. John states in his Gospel that it was before the Passover festival, that is Nisan 14 in the Hebrew Calendar. The synoptics (Matthew, Mark and Luke) indicate the first day of Passover, Nisan 15. None of the Gospels numbers the year according to any of the counting methods then in use. So the next step is to determine in which of those years Nisan 14 or 15 fell on Friday. This means more than simply looking up the calendar. Jewish months begin at the new moon. The new moon is by definition invisible, and in those days they couldn't calculate the lunar cycle as easily as they can now. They had to determine the first of the month by observing the first tiny sliver of the crescent and count from there.

The modern investigator thus has to calculate the hour and minute at which the first bit of the waxing moon of Nisan would have been visible in Jerusalem for each of these years, taking into account the time of moonrise and atmospheric conditions likely at different hours. Matters are further complicated by the possibility that an extra month might have been inserted in some of those years. This leap month was thrown in now and then to shift the lunar months back to the proper solar seasons after they had drifted out of synchrony. However, taking it all into account, Nisan 14 could have been a Friday on April 11 , A.D. 27, April 7, A.D. 30, and April 3, A.D. 33. Nisan 15 could have fallen on Fridays April 11, A.D. 27 and April 23, A.D. 34. The confusion over whether April 11, A.D. 27 was Nisan 14 or 15 is a typical uncertainty of Jewish dating.

A.D. 27 seems too early for the crucifixion anyway. [Luke 3:1,2](/en/Bible/Luke/3#v1) dates the start of the ministry of John the Baptist in the 15th year of Tiberias Caesar. This could have been no earlier then autumn A.D. 28-29. Jesus' own ministry started after his baptism by John and lasted at least two and more likely three years. A.D. 34 is too late due to a conflict with the conversion of St. Paul. Paul had necessarily be converted at some date after the crucifixion. The later events of Paul's life can be dated externally. Intervals of time he quotes himself — and nobody supposes he could not count — would put his conversion before A.D.34.

Now we are left with two possibilities: April 7, A.D. 30 and April 3, A.D. 33. Humphreys and Waddington point out this means, not so incidentally, that the crucifixion took place on Nisan 14 . “We remark that by this means, a scientific argument has been used to distinguish between different theological interpretations of the lest supper,” they say. This is, whether or not the Last Supper was a Seder. If it was held on the evening before the crucifixion, and the crucifixion took place on Nisan 14, it could not have been a Seder. Humphreys and Waddinton also point out that this dating puts Jesus' death at the hour when the Passover lambs were being slaughtered, another point of theological and symbolic significance.

But in which of the two years, A.D. 30 or 33 , did it take place? Here is where the new evidence comes in. In a speech given seven weeks after the crucifixion (on the first Christian Pentecost), St. Peter referred to a blood-red moon ([Acts 2:20](/en/Bible/Acts_of_the_Apostles/2#v20)). The context can be read to indicate that he was referring to a recent event, one that in fact took place the night after the crucifixion. Humphreys and Waddington cite the New Testament scholar F.F. Bruce in defence of this interpretation.

An eclipsed moon of ten looks red. Sunlight refracted through the earth's atmosphere enters the shadow and illuminates the moon slightly. This light is red, as the refraction separates the blue and green. Humphreys and Waddington calculated all the lunar eclipses visible from Jerusalem between A.D. 26 and 36. There were in fact 12. One happened on the night of April 3, A.D. 33. On that night an already partially eclipsed moon rose above the horizon in Jerusalem, geometrically and atmospherically very favourable conditions for it to look red. On that basis Humphreys and Waddington opt for April 3, A.D. 33.

If you are sticking to the Midwayers' record of April 7, A.D. 30, I wonder if you can tell me where Humphreys and Waddington went wrong. Unless you are an historian or a theologian, perhaps the date of the crucifixion is not important, nor the fact that this planet was the only one throughout the grand universe where a creator son was treated in this manner, but rather the superb manner in which Jesus met his death.

## Land Of The Morning Calm

In this article Robert Reno tells us of his experiences as an army chaplain in South Korea.

Because of its length we had the unenviable task of deciding whether to bring it to you in greatly abridged form or to publish it in its entirety, but in two or more parts. Since the 6-0-6 is now published only bi-monthly, we felt we had to settle for two parts.

PART 1.

### Internationalism And The Urantia Book And Outreach Ministry In South Korea

By Robert Reno

Dedicated to Meredith Sprunger and Clyde Bedell

There are two individuals who have by far made the profoundest impression upon my life, with it's increasingly growing desire to somehow serve the revelation. I consider them to be pioneering leaders within the movement, and a source of inspiration for many, including myself. I am sure that I am not alone when I express this, so if I may say this for the many, we are deeply grateful and appreciative for your inspirational leadership and examples Although I believe it goes unsaid, these two individuals, are Clyde Bedell and Meredith Sprunger. It is to them, that I would like to dedicate my efforts here in South Korea, for their inspirational outreach ministries and their selfless spirit of evangelism.

My last year and a half here in South Korea, has largely been an experiment in outreach ministry carried out under very difficult conditions due to the Army's severe demands on my time and energies. It has proven to me though, that the potential for some form of intentional, evangelistic outreach ministry is a very needed and viable endeavour, capable of bearing many fruitful readers of _The URANTIA Book_ on the international and world-wide level.

From my personal experience, I believe it is literally possible to establish thousands of readers here in South Korea. The level of receptivity that I have found here is truly amazing. These young Koreans are far less materialistic and far more idealistic and spiritually minded than the average Westerner. They are enthused to examine new truth and to pursue an understanding of the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ beyond my initial expectations.

The fundamental guiding idea of my vision for the dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_ here in South Korea and even Asia enlarge, has been to “establish a readership and nurture a leadership.” There are many factors unique to the Korean culture that makes this vision a phenomenal opportunity of service for the development of the revelation's mission throughout South Korea and the Asian world.

To use the words of several eminent Asian religious leaders in attendance at the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace: “Asia is the mainspring and matrix of almost all the great religions of the world. Spirituality which activates the higher nature of humanity abounds in Asia. It is a force that makes us one in spite of our diversity in the ways of expressing it. It is en uplifting force of higher quality within us which makes ourselves fit and worthy channels for great love and compassion as witnessed and proclaimed by all religions, as the blessing and gift from on high. We have to proclaim a renewed humanity rooted in spirituality, in the midst of a spiritual crisis of the acutest kind...” “Asia is rich in its spiritual heritage. It has a history rich with sublime religious thought and activity. This dimension of its inner resources is full of vast potential...” “The awakening of religious values that one sees here in Asia and in many parts of the world is inextricable linked to humankinds yearning for a more peaceful, just, and meaningful existence at a time of global crisis.” “The key words of human evolution are faith in God and love or sense of identity among humans.” “People of religious belief look forward to a new dawn as we near the twenty-first century.”

To briefly summarize my activities in South Korea:

I arrived in this country a year and a half ego and was stationed in the northern portion of South Korea, boarding the DMZ of South and North Korea. I immediately set about to establish a readership and found this far easier then I ever expected. Through a series of lengthy conversations, I introduced _The URANTIA Book_ to a young Korean soldier, who was very interested in the teachings I had been sharing with him.

Kim Suk Su and I began to study together on a regular basis. Soon thereafter he presented me with several of his friends wham he had told about our studies and who were very interested in the study of this “great book!”

We initiated a study group that met on a weekly basis as regularly as was possible due to Army constraints. I was impressed by the spiritual truth hunger of these young Koreans, their depth of spiritual insight and their many insightful questions they posed throughout our study groups. While some of the physical cosmology and celestial hierarchies presented in _The URANTIA Book_ were a little difficult for them to understand at first, they were sincerely responsive to the spiritual truth contained therein. It was this area of personal realization that most impressed their minds and hearts.

All of these Korean readers of the 2nd Infantry Division study group have since returned to their respective homes throughout south Korea to continue their educations or to resume work. I have been able to maintain contact with several of these readers, one of which is Kim Suk Su who has become an active evangelist of _The URANTIA Book_ in his area. He has been presenting _The URANTIA Book_ to Buddhist monks in his surrounding area, which happens to be one of the major centres of Buddhism in South Korea. The last I heard from Kim Suk Su, a number of his friends have become interested in the study of _The URANTIA Book_ through his personal efforts. Kim Suk Su has expressed to me his desire to see a translation of _The URANTIA book_ become a reality, as well as the commitment of his life to the realization of this endeavour.

Since the middle of July I have been stationed here in Seoul. The establishment of a study group here in Seoul took no longer than three weeks of my arrival. The young Korean soldier Yum Sa Sung, whom I worked with here in the chapel, soon became interested in the study of the book through our many conversations. Once again, Yum Sa sung presented me with several of his civilian friends, who through his recommendation and enthusiasm, were interested in the study of _The URANTIA Book_.

Our first few study groups focused mainly on clarifying the basic terminology of _The URANTIA Book_, exploring some of the fundamental differences between the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ and Jesus as presented therein, compared to the teachings of Christianity as it has been taught them by Christian missionaries. Kim Suk oh and Lee Jong Kun both come from a Christian orientation, and Lee Jong Kur in particular, is exceptionally well studied in the scriptures and the teachings of Christianity. He is a leader within his religious community, and is open to further spiritual growth and the examination of new religious truth. Even now, Lee Jong Kun is applying these new insights and truths he is learning through his study of _The URANTIA Book_ within the religious training course he teaches on the junior high, high school and college level.

The two experiences of studying with Lee Jong Kun that stand most out in my mind, was when we covered, the first paper on the Universal father and erroneous concepts of God, and the sections discussing the meaning of Jesus death on the cross. It was these studies, that played a key role in answering several questions that had been in the back of Kun's searching mind. Kun had long before thought about and questioned the atonement doctrine, and whether science and religion really were two opposing forces.

The next area of outreach ministry that I would like to talk about, one that I believe has vast potential for future development here in South Korea, is the pen-pal sponsorship program initiated by Melissa Wells and the Nashville study group.

The goal of this project is to put one Korean reader in contact with one American reader through a pen-pal relationship. The guidelines of this sponsorship program are that the American reader agreed to supply a copy of _The URANTIA Book_ to the Korean reader, and support their ongoing studies through the pen-pal relationship. The Korean reader agrees to study _The URANTIA Book_ and also to maintain cor. respondence as required for support in the study of _The URANTIA Book_. There are currently five young Koreans being sponsored in such a manner, one of whom is Buddhist.

This form of outreach ministry offers a unique opportunity for developing a personal relationship with a reader from another culture very different than our own. It is a relationship in which it is possible to share with each other our personal experiences with spiritual truth within our respective cultures and practical everyday lives, and to learn of each other's spiritual life goals.

Another area of outreach ministry I have endeavoured to carry out since I have been here in South Korea has been the placement of gift copies of _The URANTIA Book_ in university and public libraries. To date, 22 universities and 13 public libraries throughout Seoul have received gift copies. This has been a very rewarding experience and I was received warmly by all the directors of the libraries concerned.

One of the highlights of my experiences here in South Korea was the opportunity to attend a major gathering of many of Asia's most eminent religious leaders attending the Third Assembly of the Asian Conference on Religion and Peace held here in Seoul Korea.

It was in this way that I had the opportunity to meet and converse with religionists hailing from every part of Asia and from diverse faiths. There was even a sizable delegation from mainland China. One of the most fruitful contacts that I was able to make though, was with a Korean won Buddhist minister named Yoo Song Tae. As a result of our brief meeting at the conference, we were able to initiate a dialogue through correspondence, and it was in this way that Yoo Song Tae requested to publish my letter of introduction in the major Won Buddhist journal. In his latter he says: "The reason why I've made up my mind to do so is due to your meaningful and significant writing suitable for the core of Won Buddhist doctrine. Among the doctrines of Won Buddhism there is a motto as follows: “All truths lead to one (Buddha, Toa, God). So do the cosmic worlds. All human races are one family. The world is the same workshop. Let's open up one world.”

Won Buddhism is one of the major sects of Buddhism in Korea, and was founded by Park Chung-bin (Ven. Chongsam) in 1916. There are approximately 500,000 followers in Korea, with missionary activities overseas, including the USA.

The teachings of Won Buddhism strive for universality, and profess that the essence of truth is the same in all religions. In Won Buddhism, the circle is the symbol of ultimate reality and the source of all being. On the individual level they strive to become enlightened to one's own original nature (Buddha nature or Il won which means One Truth), and hence to personally realize the source of all beings in the universe.

On the social level they aspire towards the ideals. of public service and the spiritual transformation of the world's civilizations. Ven. Chongam says: "In the future, those who are truthful and work for the public good will become the noblest men in the world..." The founding motto of their Ven. Master is, “As material civilization develops, cultivate spiritual civilization accordingly.” They teach that "When the development of our inward spiritual civilization can keep pace with the development of the outward material civilization, perfect peace and tranquility will be brought forth in this world." They teach that religion is a personal experience, yet that people must play a leading role in the transformation of society. The three principles of Won Buddhism are, modernization, popularization, and practicality. They search for the truth and harmony of all the religions of the world, and don't hesitate to appreciate truth from, and use as reference the scriptures of the world.

Yoo song Tae is even now studying _The URANTIA Book_ as I am studying the Won Buddhist teachings and scriptures. In the future, we hope to exchange articles focusing on spiritual life goals and interfaith sharing, to be published in each other' respective journals.

Over the last few years I have had the growing conviction that there are two great commissions for those who choose to serve the revelation:

1) That of the revelators themselves, the placing of the revelation as "_The URANTIA Book_" into mortal hands, and the commission to disseminate it throughout the world.
2) The commission of Christ Michael himself. The commission to take the message of the gospel to all the world. “That which the world needs most to know is men are the sons of God and, through faith, they can actually realize and daily experience this ennobling truth.” ([UB 193:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/193#p0_4))

For the latter, we have the superb example of Jesus own life, as revealed in the story of his life and teachings, but alas, for the former, by and large we have only challenge, opportunity, and uncertainty. I have pondered this issue, this question, this challenge for most of my years of reading _The URANTIA Book_. For myself, I have found two areas of thought to shed valuable light upon this issue. These two areas of thought are, the religious challenge of this age, and the solutions thereto as revealed in _The URANTIA Book_.

The reason I have found so much insight in this concept of the religious challenge of the age, is simply that the religious challenge of the age, “is” the religious challenge of the world today. If we look around we will find within the world today many "forward looking groups" striving to solve the religious challenge of our age.

In the second part Bob gives us quotations from Asia's religious leaders and finishes with an important message for us all:

## Excerpt From Letter 11, Summer 1986

During the "International encounter" at the Montvillargenne Castle, we had the opportunity to live with great intensity, moments of deep, sincere and unforgettable brotherhood. Relationships transcended the material and intellectual levels and were established as deep as the soul level.

We lived not as students and teachers, but only as individuals in search of other individuals in order to understand and love each other. Everyone was so different, but still gathered together with a common denominator: the consciousness of being children of a unique and loving Father and the desire to live this sonship and the consequent brotherhood which follows. Each person added their own unique contribution, always acting with sincerity.

In fact it was easy for us to live like this. The participants, some of which had travelled very far, brought an extraordinary will to know, learn and share. The morning prayer/meditation brought our souls closer together. We were like seeds in a pod, protected and huddled the one against the others."Spiritual grouth is mutually stimulated by intimate association with other religionists. Love supplies the soil for religious growth... (1094:1) Each one of us, as we returned back home, felt a full, a yearning to prolong this state of grace. For most of us, after this warm bath of brotherhood, we will go back and submerge ourselves in the cold waters of everyday life and find ourselves in our ordinary social surroundings.

What we have been able to realize between us, why not try to realize it around us? It behooves each of us, in our own everyday surroundings, to enter into this process. Open wide the seed pods and spread the leaven of love around us. If we are conscious of being the loved daughters and sons of the Universal Father of love, then we are conscious that all men and women are our brothers and sisters, not only those who read _The URANTIA book_.

## Walk And Talk About Day

Since time immemorial the Australian Aborigine has gone on his 'Walk About'.

on Sat. 13th June, we are inviting you to a 'Walk and Talk About Day'.

Whether you are an old or new student of _The URANTIA Book_, there must be many questions in your mind, which you might like to discuss with fellow readers. Cathy Hoffman and Steven Shanahan both will open their homes (they are neighbours) They like to extend a warm welcome to all Six-0-Six readers and their friends.

If you can't make it to the national conference this year, which will be held in Sydney on the 9th — 11th 0ct., then this is your chance to meet with follow students.

So B.Y.O. question, U-Book, pencil & paper, cushion or folding chair, some tucker and an open, eager to learn mind.

Entree fee is at least one question.
