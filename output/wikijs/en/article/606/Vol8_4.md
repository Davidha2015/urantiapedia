## Let's Talk About...

Saturday 13th June was “Walk And Talk About Day” in Brighton, Victoria, hosted by Steve Shanahan and Cathy Hoffman.

Melbourne had turned on a beautiful sunny day for the occasion. The atmosphere was very relaxed and homely with people sitting around a log fire. Both old and new readers of _The URANTIA Book_ shared the experience. We were very happy to see a few country readers too. Will Wentworth came all the way from N.S.W. and Christopher and Bridget Billington came from East Gippsland.

The accent was on socializing, but people were also given the opportunity to put in a little of their.time to cover some of the 150 URANTIA Books so far received from the URANTIA Brotherhood for the Library Placement Scheme. With a true team spirit we tackled this job and had a lot of fun during the process.

After lunch and a stroll in the sunshine to a beautiful old mansion in the neighborhood, it was time for a study group. Paper 101: “The Real Nature of Religion” generated of course plenty of discussion.

Later on in the afternoon we approached the following subjects:

1. Library Placement Scheme.
	People were offered the opportunity to personally place a book in their local library. If you want to participate in this project, books are still available for placement. Just contact the following people:
	- In N.S.W. ring Kathleen Swadling on (02) 913-7893
	- In Vic. ring Steve Shanahan on (03) 592- 8690
	- In Q1d. ring Neil Francey on (07) 849- 4504
	- In W.A. ring Peter Webb on (09) 561-1417
	- In S.A. ring Steve Shanahan
	To raise funds for the postage of library books it was suggested that we could have some social events for which a small fee was charged.
2. Subscriptions for Six-0-Six Newsletter.
	Most people were in favour of a $10 per year subscription fee for the newsletter to cover costs of postage photocopying, envelopes, registration with Australia Post etc. Overseas readers US $12.
	Your thoughts are welcome concerning this matter.
3. Book Sales.
	It was decided that sales of URANTIA Books should in future be handled by bookstores. Although Steve Shanahan reports that about 80 books in 8 months were sold, mostly through personal recommendation, we still felt that the book belongs in bookshops. As Kevin Meyrick pointed out last year at the Melbourne Conference: Every time we sell a book at cost price, a bookshop misses out on a sale. To create the demand in bookshops, we must stand. back and let the booktrade handle it, even though it means that it pushes up the price from $40 to $65 and more. In the last month we have approached the following bookshops: The Mystical, The Esoteric, Crysalis and The T.S. Bookshop, who have all agreed to carry the book and have promised to display it.
	If you send us a stamped self-addressed envelope, we can provide you with these bookstores' business cards. If you or your friends present these business cards when purchasing an URANTIA Book or Concordex, these shops will give you a discount.
	We have also had an offer from Nevile Seaborn to display the book in his healthfood store in Boronia. Nevile has been a 6-0-6 reader for many years. You can contact him on (03) 7624333.
	We will approach more bookstores over the next few months as books become available.

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “The consciousness of a victorious human life on earth is born of that creature faith which dares to challenge each recurring episode of existence when confronted with the awful spectacle of human limitations, by the unfailing declaration: Even if I cannot do this, there lives in me one who can and will do it, a part of the Father-Absolute of the universe of universes. And that is ”the victory which overcomes the world, even your faith."<br>(_The URANTIA Book_ [UB 4:4.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/4#p4_9))

## From Library Placement Committee

Over the past five years the URANTIA Brotherhood has donated 200 URANTIA Books to Australia, to be placed in libraries around the country.

They have recently committed themselves to donating another 400 books to complete the project which has been undertaken in Australia by the Library Placement Committee to have an URANTIA book in every public library in this country.

The Committee now needs funds to post these books to country areas. One hundred of these 400 have already been placed and another one hundred are on the way. With 300 books to be posted at a cost of approx. $5 per book, we need to raise $1500 to accomplish this task,

We ask for your help in this project. Over the last year 6 people we know of have discovered _The URANTIA Book_ in their local library and have written to the URANTIA Foundation for more information.

If you are moved to contribute towards the spreading of this new revelation, donations for postage of library books are gratefully accepted. Through your gesture of generosity one more human being might pick up this book from a library shelf and experience the wonderful transformation it can bring about.

Cheques can be made out to Six-0-Six Newsletter, but please specify, that the donation is for the library project.

## The William Sadler Jr Tapes

There are now several sets of the William Sadler Jr. tapes available for loan to anyone interested.

The tapes consist of excerpts from several workshops led by William Sadler Jr. in the late 1950's for advanced students of _The URANTIA Book_.

William Sadler Jr. was one of the members of the Forum group in Chicago, which was instrumental in editing the transcripts of the revelation during the 1930's and 1940's and organizing its eventual publication in 1955.

It would be difficult to discover anyone with a clearer and more complete grasp of the philosophy revealed in _The URANTIA Book_ than William Sadler Jr. He was involved with the revelation from its early days and devoted much of his life to understanding its teaching and passing on that understanding to others. He is the author of “A Study of the Master Universe”, published in 1968, which is an extrapolation of the cosmological pattern portrayed in the URANTIA book. Some of the concepts discussed in the tapes are developed more fully in this later printed work.

The tapes may not suit everyone. For one thing, their technical quality is very poor — probably owing to the conditions under which they were recorded, and the state of the art in the 1950's. Personally, however, I found the tapes very helpful in illuminating some of the more difficult sections of the book. Sadler seems to have a way of finding just the right phrase, image, or simple analogy to throw light on concepts which previously had completely baffled me. I could not make head or tail of such notions as the ABSONITE, the ABSOLUTES OF POTENTIALITY or the various TRINITIES, for instance, until I heard Sadler analyse and simplify them on tape. Only a man with a thorough grasp of his subject could communicate so directly and lucidly. It was a real pleasure to have light thrown on concepts which for many years have had me totally baffled.

The tapes — 29 cassettes — can be borrowed from the study groups listed below. Any group which has not received a set — or which needs another set — should contact me: William Wentworth 064 — 967139.

Groups with sets of tapes:
- Sydney: Trevor Swadling 02 — 913- 7893
- Melbourne: Steve Shanahan 03 — 592-8690
- Perth: Jayne Lane 09 — 342- 5896
- Brisbane: Neil Francey 07 — 849- 4504
- Canberra: William Wentworth 064 — 967-139

## Lao Shou Hsing, God of Longevity

> “And Chinese tradition preserves the hazy record of the evolutionary past....” ([UB 79:8.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/79#p8_15))

One of the gods of Chinese tradition is the god of longevity. The Chinese people have an ardent desire for longevity whose divinity SHOU LAO or SHOU HSING resides in the star Canopus in the constellation Argo.

Old-fashioned Chinese families especially in diaspora, possessed a set of statues of eight immortals ( Pa Hsien or 八仙) which decorated the banquet table on anniversaries, with two children on the backs of water buffaloes, who they had dispatched to fetch the God of Longevity beyond the hills.

It is believed that this stellar divinity of lang life descended to earth in human form. He is represented as a delightful old man with a high and done shaped forehead, armed with a rugged staff and bearing in the other hand a fruit from the tree of immortality.

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia" alt="chinese God">
<img src="/image/article/606/chinese_God.jpg">
</figure>

This fruit, a peach of immortality (P'ang T'ao or 仙桃) enjoys an enormous popularity in Chinese art. The peach is culled from a miraculous tree which blossoms every 3000 years and only yields its fruit 3000 years after.

In every case SHOU HSING or SHOU LAO appears gentle and smiling, his venerable head, abnormally high on the upper part with white hair and eyebrows, mounted or leaning upon a stag.

He wears a yellow robe and he will be recognized as the supreme disposer of earthly things and the eternal ruler of the seasons.

The emperor Ch' in Shih Huang Ti (246 B.C.), after he had unified China, was induced by the Taoists to build a temple in his honour and the Tang dynasty introduced sacrifices to the Star God at the autumnal equinox.

I have had several statues of the God of Longevity in my home for a long time. One day I suddenly rushed to my URANTIA Book to find this sentence:

> “Upon the outbreak of the rebellion it (the tree of life) was regrown from the central core by Van and his associates in their temporary camp. This Edentia shrub was subsequently taken to their highland retreat, where it served both Van and Amadon for more than one hundred thousand years.” ([UB 73:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/73#p6_5)).

What I had realized so suddenly was, the stick held by the God of Longevity is the shrub of the tree of life to be regrown and the peach of immortality is the fruit of the tree of life. The Chinese legend says he is a stellar divinity from Canopus and descends to earth in human form. Did Canopus mean Jerusem?

Who could better personify longevity than Van who stayed on our planet for more than 450,000 years. I am inclined to conclude that the God of Longevity is a representation of Van. If you pass in front of a Chinese gift shop, please ask the shopkeeper to show you the God of Longevity and remember the fabulous story of “VAN — THE STEADFAST”

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia" alt="chinese God">
<img src="/image/article/606/chinese_God2.jpg">
</figure>

It was the Taoists in the third century B.C. who had honoured the God of Longevity. URANTIA Book readers know how the Taoists and especially Lao-Tse had built his teachings directly upon the concepts of the Salem traditions. ([UB 94:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/94#p6_3))

One day flying in the plane to Europe, I was reading an advertisement on WANG computers, when suddenly I understood that I have to pronounce VAN like WANG 王 (say VON) The explanation came slowly after my mind was illuminated. WANG means in Chinese “King”. “Wang” is understood as a function, a mediator between Heaven and Earth, between God and mankind. We have the confirmation in the ideogram:

<figure id="Figure_5" class="image urantiapedia" alt="chinese name">
<img src="/image/article/606/wang.jpg">
</figure>

The first top horizontal line is the symbol of Heaven, the second line represents mankind, the third line is Earth. The vertical line is the junction line between Heaven, man and Earth. This is the symbol for “ King ”, the middleman who interprets Heaven's will to mankind and who rules Earth on behalf of Heaven.

From the planetary rebellion to the arrival of Adam and Eve the affairs of Urantia were for a long time administered by a council of planetary receivers. “And thus was Urantia governed and administered until the arrival of Adam” ([UB 67:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p6_5))

> “The twelve Melchizedek receivers of Urantia did heroic work. They preserved the remnants of civilization, and their planetary policies were faithfully executed by Van.” ([UB 67:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/67#p6_6))

Van's function on earth for several thousand years was the prototype of a king functioning as ideally understood in Chinese tradition: the king is “VAN” (or WANG) ! There is no better designation for ”King" than the name of the man who faithfully executed the planetary policies of Heaven.

> “....Van, who thereby relinquished the titular authority which for over one hundred and fifty thousand years he had held by virtue of the action of the Melchizedek receivers.” ([UB 74:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/74#p2_6))

So how to pronounce VAN?

I would like to suggest the pronunciation which may have a linguistic and historic basis.

Now I say VAN like 王

## Aussies Off To General Conference In USA

We know of at least two people who will attend the General Conference in Maine, USA, which will be held at Bowdoin College, Brunswick on August 2-7, 1987.

Neil Francey from Robinson, Brisbane, Q1d. and William Wentworth from Towamba, NSW will be representing Australia. The theme of the conference is: “Our relationship with God: Personal Transformation and its Power to Transform the World.” We wish them safe journey and are looking forward to their report on this great spiritual experience.

## Dear Six-0-Six

I do want to continue to get your newsletter. I enjoy hearing about URANTIA news from there!

You have my permission to give my name to students of _the URANTIA Book_ travelling in Florida! ( In fact — with forewarning — I will make my guest room available to travelling URANTIA Book students. I ask only for previous identification and names of other URANTIA Book students who will vouch for them.)

Your newsletter is thought provoking and mind stretching and I enjoy it very much! Will any of you be coming to the International Conference in Maine, USA in August? If so, I hope our paths will cross as I will be there.

Patricia J. Mills, Sarasota, FL. USA

## Where is that Jolly Jumbuck?

Perhaps the Australian swagman, the way Banjo Patterson described him in his song “Waltzing Matilda”, is a thing of the past. Who wants to walk around Australia with a smelly sheep in his tuckerbag anyway?

The modern swagman has his mind on far more uplifting things than just filling his stomach. This was proven by the colourful character who strolled into the Perth URANTIA Bookbooth last January. Looking at the display of books, a grin appeared on his long-bearded face. A very thumbed URANTIA Book was pulled out of his swag, while he remarked: “So you've finally caught up, uh?” He had been reading it for years!

## Conference Reminder

We like to remind our readers who would like to attend the 1987 Sydney National Conference, that registration forms should be in by Sept. 1st.

## Visitor From New York

The Sunday after our ‘Walk And Talk About Day’, we entertained an overseas URANTIA Book reader from New York. Bart Ice had contacted us previous to his Melbourne visit and expressed his desire to meet a few Australian U-Book readers. Bart reports that New York has applied to form their first URANTIA Society. Out of the 17 million people or so who make up the population of New York, there are 20 people keen enough to take on the responsibilities that go together with having a Society.

At the Melbourne Conference last year, Australian URANTIA Book readers decided that forming a Society was premature and to be held in mind for the future. Were we too ambitious even thinking about it? If you consider that Australia's population over all is about the same as New York's, and that our readers are living over an area of 7,686.850 km^2^, may be it was slightly ambitious. But society or no society, there is plenty of activity going on as is shown by our booksales.

## On Our Journey Inward

_The URANTIA Book_ of ten speaks about our universe career as an ascent or upward climb, but adds as a clarification that in reality it is a journey inward. ([UB 32:3.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p3_11))

As I stood pondering about this one day while washing the dishes, which is a good time for such reflections, I could see several meanings of this inward movement.

The first one is the long, long road to Paradise, the very centre and the master pattern of all universal material reality, the personal residence of the Universal Father. Geographically seen, that certainly is a journey inward and something to really look forward to. However Paradise is a long way into the future and as a Mighty Messenger points out on [UB 32:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p3_6) of _The URANTIA Book_: “The farther down the scale of life we go, the more difficult it becomes to locate, with the eye of faith, the invisible Father.” To compensate for their limited concept of Him, the Father has established a sevenfold approach to Deity for His evolutionary creatures.

The Creator Son is the first step in our sevenfold approach to the Universal Father. Jesus said to Thomas at the farewell discourse: “I am the way, the truth, and the life. No man goes to the Father except through me. All who find the Father, first find me. If you know me, you know the way to the Father.” ([UB 180:3.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p3_7))

In the foreword of the book we are told by a Divine Counselor: “Such an experiential discovery-career of the realization of God begins with the recognition of the divinity of the Creator Son of the local universe and ascends through the superuniverse Ancients of Days and by way of the person of one of the Seven Master Spirits to the attainment of the discovery and recognition of the divine personality of the Universal Father on Paradise.” ([UB 0:8.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/0#p8_9))

Our Mighty Messenger points out some of the pitfalls for us or even for beings of a higher spiritual status: “The lower creatures — and sometimes even the higher personalities — find it difficult always to envisage the Universal Father in his Creator Sons. And so, pending the time of their spiritual exaltation, when perfection of development will enable them to see God in person, they grow weary in progression, entertain spiritual doubts, stumble into confusion, and thus isolate themselves from the progressive spiritual aims of their time and universe. In this way they lose the ability to see the Father when beholding the Creator Son.” ([UB 32:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p3_6)) Lucifer was a good example of this. In his “Declaration of Liberty” he stated that the Universal Father did not really exist, but that it was just a myth invented by the Paradise Sons. ([UB 53:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/53#p3_2))

It is so easy for us to become impatient with the long wait to see the Father personally. We are created in a time conscious universe. Sometimes we feel that things don't move fast enough and so we try and speed them up. An example of this was Eve. She became too impatient. She was not willing to settle down to the long endurance test. She thought to add her own little scheme of world saving to the larger and more far-reaching divine plan. ([UB 75:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p4_1)) “Even though this project of modifying the divine plan had been conceived and executed with entire sincerity and with only the highest motives concerning the welfare of the world, it constituted evil because it represented the wrong way to achieve righteous ends, because it departed from the right way, the divine plan”, Solonia, the seraphic voice in the garden of Eden, tells us on [UB 75:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/75#p4_6).

The Melchizedek missionaries in Mesopotamia suffered also defeat when they tried to move too fast. They raised the moral standard too high for the people of their time. “They had been commissioned to preach a definite gospel, to proclaim the truth of the reality of the Universal Father, but they became entangled in the apparently worthy cause of reforming the mores, and thus was their great mission sidetracked and virtually lost in frustration and oblivion”. ([UB 95:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p1_8))

And now we've been given the Fifth Epochal Revelation. Will we become frustrated with the rate it is going to take roots? Will we entertain spiritual doubts or grow weary in progression? Or do we trust in the divine plan for our planet?

The dictionary defines patience as the capacity for calmly enduring trying situations or accepting delay with equanimity, or tolerant and even-tempered perseverance.

Jesus expressed this patience so beautifully, when he said to Ganid: ‘My son, everything must await the coming of its time. You are born into the world, but no amount of anxiety and no manifestation of impatience will help you to grow up. You must, in all such matters, wait upon time. Time alone will ripen the green fruit upon the tree. Season follows season and sundown follows sunrise only with the passing of time. I am now on the way to Rome with you and your father, and that is sufficient for today. My tomorrow is wholly in the hands of my Father in heaven’. ([UB 130:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/130#p5_3)) Later on, during the forty days in the Perean hills, when he had to take the six great decisions about the problems he was facing in the remainder of his life on earth, he chose “... the natural, slow and sure way of accomplishing the divine purpose”. ([UB 136:8.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/136#p8_5))

The URANTIA movement in Australia and the Pacific area is still very much in its pioneering days. Most book readers are studying in isolation. The advice to form thousands of study groups was given by our very wise revelators. In the study group setting we find an ideal situation to learn and grow.

‘Maybe a pint can never hold a quart, ([UB 48:7.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_5)) but two pints still make up a quart’, Emanuel Lou from Papeete, Tahiti, remarked with that delightful twinkle in his eye as he pointed to two people around our study group table. “Hence the need for study groups”.

We can help each other so much in our understanding of the teachings in _the URANTIA Book_. Have you ever experienced the sheer joy and delight when somebody in the group reads one of those stunning statements, which almost leaves you speechless. One person exclaims: “Wow!” You look up from your book, and see the eyes of your friends light up in this mutual discovery of truth. beauty and goodness? But the natural process from wanting to read on one's own to the inner urge of wanting to share and learn with others takes time. Again it is the trust in some greater plan than ours, which carries us through the often shaky early years of our study groups, when attendance is often irregular. But as Jesus said: “Make progress. We shall be none too ready when the Father calls”. ([UB 137:7.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/137#p7_3))

The trust of the human Jesus was born out of the trust in his Father. And the greater part of his mortal life Jesus was human. Although he gradually became conscious of his divinity, he did not fully remember his prehuman divine existence as Michael of Nebadon until the day of his baptism by John in the Jordan river. On that day he must have remembered his long training as a virgin Creator Son on Paradise. The long apprenticeship, when he watched his elder brothers in their creations. The billion years he couldn't leave his headquarters, because his personal presence was needed for the stabilization of his universe. The billion years since he first set out to start his bestowal life as a Melchizedek Son, the first one of his seven bestowal lives. And when he finally won the unquestioned sovereignty of his universe on that afternoon in late summer A.D. 25, what did this Creator Son do the next morning after he came from Mount Hermon? Did he open a bottle of champagne and have a party to celebrate after all these billions of years waiting? He put on his apron and presented himself for work in Zebedee's workshop, saying: “It behooves me to keep busy while I wait for my hour to came”. How patient can you get!

And that brings me to another meaning, as I saw it, of that journey inward: The becoming conscious of a divine presence within us, which is beyond time. Our Thought Adjuster is a fragment of the Universal Father, the First Source and Centre. He has no beginning and no end. Seen from our human point of view, the Adjuster patiently waits. But seen from the divine point of view, I wonder if an Adjuster really has any need to be patient.

The reason why I an saying this is that on [UB 54:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/54#p5_13) of _The URANTIA Book_ a Mighty Messenger mentions that the lapse of time needed to finish the adjudication of Lucifer, even if it takes a hundred thousand years of our Urantia time, would seem like two and a half seconds as seen from the viewpoint of Uversa, the capital of our superuniverse. From the paradise viewpoint the adjudication is simultaneous with the enactment.

In other words, time does not exist on Paradise nor in the consciousness of our Adjuster who hails from Paradise.

If I held a glass of cool water in front of you after you had been running on a hot day and said to you: “You just have to wait one second for this”, I'm sure you would not get impatient. After all, what's one second? But the ‘time’ that you will fuse with your Thought Adjuster is less than one second for the Adjuster. It is an event of fact ([UB 109:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_4)) “un fait accompli” as the French would say. Because as a Melchizedek of Nebadon points out on [UB 106:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p9_3): “On the absolute level there is neither time nor space, all potentials may be there perceived as actuals”.

As we journey inward and our human mind becomes more and more one with the divine mind, we seem to transcend time and the need for patience. As we shift our consciousness to the innermost centre of our being, there is no need for anxiety or worry about tomorrow. We find peace there and security, we are safe in the palm of His hand.

<figure id="Figure_7" class="image urantiapedia" alt="hand">
<img src="/image/article/606/hand.jpg">
<figcaption><em>We Are Safe In The Palm Of His Hand</em></figcaption>
</figure>

Of all the things that we try to achieve day by day, the most important is better communication with this Father fragment. We can run around in circles for as long as we like, but our greatest goal is still to try and “... advance the borders of self-consciousness out through the dim realms of embryonic soul-consciousness in a wholehearted effort to reach the borderland of spirit-consciousness — contact with the divine presence”, ([UB 196:3.34](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_34)) we are reminded in one of the last paragraphs of the book.

There is yet another journey inward — the seven psychic circles. Starting with the seventh, we move inward to the first. To successfully graduate for these it is not only necessary to become conscious of the divinity within us, but we have to add experience, and the necessary repetitions of certain experiences to the morontia ingredient of our being — our soul. Our personality has to unify our physical, mental and spiritual bodies into one harmonious whole. “It is to the mind of perfect poise, housed in a body of clean habits, stabilized neural energies, and balanced chemical function- when the physical, mental and spiritual powers are in triune harmony of development — that a maximum of light and truth can be imparted with a minimum of temporal danger or risk to the real welfare of such a being. By such a balanced growth does man ascend the circles of planetary progression one by one, from the seventh to the first”. ([UB 110:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p6_4))

To some people it is a perilous journey. “True it is, you mortals are of earthly animal origin; your frame is indeed dust. But if you actually will, if you really desire, surely the heritage of the ages is yours, and you shall someday serve throughout the universes in your true characters — children of the Supreme God of experience and divine sons of the Paradise Father of all personalities”. ([UB 112:7.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p7_19))

“The goal of eternity is ahead! the adventure of divinity attainment lies before you! The race for perfection is on! whosoever will may enter, and certain victory will crown the efforts of every human being who will run the race of faith and trust, depending every step of the way on the leading of the indwelling Adjuster and on the guidance of that good spirit of the Universe Son, which so freely has been poured out upon all flesh”. ([UB 32:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_8))

Dear Six-0-Six,

I am enclosing a newspaper cutting of a segment of news on SPACE RINGS, by an astronomer Dr. Petrosian, of Stanford University.

This news clipping was taken from our HERALD DAILY about Mid January 1987... or there abouts.

I am sure you will be able to realize its significance in line with the explained teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ in so far as the development and growth of the outer space regions beyond our superuniverse.

I would like to see this further researched, if possible, by some of your scientific writers and Newsletter contributors. I enclose a copy of this news cutting in the hope that someone can take up this small lead offered, and regret I do not have the in depth knowledge of that science to be of any further assistance.

Can I be kept on the mailing list for the 6-0-6. I have read two or three issues of the paper and think it serves a great purpose in informing scattered URANTIA Book readers. A splendid effort! Keep up the good work.

I really hope he is able to make it as he is sure to come away with a wonderful sense of fellowship. I have enclosed one of his letters for your information. Should anyone wish to write to him his mailing address is:

Dear Reno,

In my church many friends and juniors are expecting to read _The URANTIA Book_ and know Jesus more intimately. So, at least 7 more URANTIA Books are wanted. If we want to spread the book throughout my country, we must have systems to supply the book instantly and abundantly. As fast as possible I would like to receive 7 books. About the 20th June I will organize two URANTIA Book study groups, one in the church and one in the school.

Turning my topic to Ermanuel Lou's invitation to attend the Australian Pacific Meeting, I want to attend it. Under the circumstances which I can know and control, I can attend it.Next year I will enter post-graduate school at my university,MBA. If I will fail to enter it, I must join the army, then I won't be able to attend. But the possibility of failing is less than 10%. So you may think that I can and will be there.

Every morning pray that my soul and character may be strengthened into doing the will of our Heavenly Father and into living in joy and contentment. May Jesus lead us into a more deepening belief, love and grace.

Lee Jeong Kun, Seoul Korea

## Was This Another “Shady” Deal ?

Obviously it had all been pre-arranged. As a car drove into our carport and blew the horn, I quickly jumped up. I opened the front door and stepped outside. It was one of those few warm April nights. Melburnians had been soaking up the last of the summer sun that Saturday. In the dim light I saw the shape of an old model car, the colour was hard to define. The window on the driver's side was turned down.

I handed over some money. “Here you are, I think you'll find this right”.

A hand came out and took the money. "I can't see it,
I'11 just have to trust you“, a voice replied. ”The parcels are on the back seat".

I quickly opened one of the rear doors and saw two cartons and a plastic bag. I took the two cartons and closed the car door again.

“Thanks, it is nice to see you again”, I said and bent over to give my courier a friendly kiss on the cheek. It was then that I noticed the suspicious looking character behind the wheel. He was wearing a black patch over one eye.He drove out of the driveway again. The whole deal had not taken more than a few minutes.

What was in those parcels and who was this mysterious messenger? What was going on in Salisbury Court. Was this another “shady” deal?

That depends on how you would like to define “shady”. It was pretty dark in our carport at that time of the evening, I must admit. The suspicious character with the black eyepatch was our good friend Ian Esmore, trying to cope with an eye infection. And the parcels? You've guessed it. Two URANTIA Books. Special delivery for our friends from East Gippsland, Christopher and Bridget Billington, who would pick them up early next morning on their way home in W-Tree near Buchan, Victoria.

Christopher had rang me that morning and asked for two books. I had been unable to get in touch with Steve Shanahan that day. But through a stroke of good luck or maybe a poke in the ribs from his guardian angel, Ian had given me a ring and asked me if I had heard from the Billingtons. I explained my promise to Christopher to try and get him some books and Ian had arranged for this special delivery. It all went so speedily because Ian was running late for whatever he had to do that night.
