## A note from the 6-0-6 Team

We like to welcome all our readers back after our holiday season. With our Pacific meeting for URANTIA Book readers less than nine months away the planning and organizing are well on their way.

Everyone is invited to send in suggestions for the programme and we are also interested in hearing from any people with musical talents for possible contributions in that field.

For all the procrastinators among us, who have not yet returned their reply slip requesting a registration form, we'll include one with this issue. If you are a member of that tribe, maybe you can forsake your principles this time and return it straight away. That way you can't forget.

We like to stress that registrations must be returned by the 18th March. Why so early, you might ask.

It is necessary to book our accommodation at Ranelagh House, Robertson by April. If we can book for 80 people or more, we will have the place to ourselves. Otherwise we will share it with other guests.

We are expecting quite a few visitors from other countries. Anyone who has attended the last conference in Sydney will agree that it was indeed a wonderful experience and the next one we hope will be even better. Don't miss this opportunity to meet some of our overseas family, exchange new ideas and make new friends.

This year, 1988, is our ninth year of publication. We want to encourage everyone to keep on writing to us, for without your letters and articles there wouldn't be a Six-0-Six Newsletter.

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “Spiritual development depends, first, on the maintenance of a living spiritual connection with true spiritual forces and, second, on the continuous bearing of spiritual fruit: yielding the ministry to one's fellows of that which has been received from one's spiritual benefactors. Spiritual progress is predicated on intellectual recognition of spiritual poverty coupled with the self-consciousness of perfection-hunger, the desire to know God and be like him, the wholehearted purpose to do the will of the Father in heaven”. _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 100:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_1)

## From Our Mailbag

Dear friends in Australia,

I wanted to send the following letter to you too, because it has some information. It is interesting to see how the network starts working. Perhaps it would be a useful idea to keep in touch, for example by sending a page of the latest news once a year — while waiting for our informal network to evolve?

The information concerning your South Pacific Meeting has been in our newsletter. By the way, Berkeley sent it to me too.

Give my greetings to Steven Shanahan. Hope your meeting will be as nice as the one we had in France!

On the basis of received letters or personal friendship the following circular letter was mailed to:

- A.M. Bailey, ACFUA, California, U.S.A.
- John Blogg, URANTIA Book Readers of Amsterdam, Holland Oliver ‘Asana’ Duex, The Synergist, California, U.S.A. Francois Dupont, Belgium
- Berkeley Elliott, Oklahoma, U.S.A.
- Cece Forrester, Chicago, U.S.A.
- David Glass, Inspiration, Texas, U.S.A.
- David Jaquith, The Pennyprickle Press, Oregon, U.S.A.
- George Michelson-Dupont, Letter, France
- Jean-Daniel Mottier, L'Echo, Switzerland

Dear friends,

During the past few months I have received a couple of letters from different countries as a result of the article in _The URANTIA Book_ Synergist. These letters have been addressed to URANTIA Book readers of Finland and I do not know how many letters have been sent back before the local post office connected me with this mysterious title. The article in The Synergist was partly based on my correspondence with Oliver ‘Asana’ Duex and there is some obvious misunderstanding — not harmful at all, but confusing to me. So I feel like writing a couple of words about Finnish readers.

The Finnish translation has been going on for about twenty years. The third version was started in 1984 and should be finished in two years. This translation is done by Seppo Kanerva and there is a group of about a hundred readers supporting the work financially. This group arranges also national meetings (open to visitors from other countries, too) and it has a newsletter of its own. There are several independent study groups in the country and usually at least some of the members belong to the support group (beginners are not accepted).

This unorganized network has worked rather well. However, because of several reasons we have faced the need to get registered as a non-profit association and the constitution is being drafted. It is not an easy task because this future association is planned to become a society of the Brotherhood as well. Perhaps our efforts will make it easier to establish later societies outside of the United States.

There is also a small unregistered group of outreach-minded readers and a few of them belong to the support group too. They plan to have an international conference in Finland in 1989. It seems to me that neither the support group nor the future association/society will take part in the arrangements.

I met Berkeley Elliott ( the chairman of the Internationa1 Fellowship Committee) in Israel in 1985. Because of her activities I have come to know quite a few readers in different countries. It has meant also that I started receiving letters where I was asked about readers in Finland. One of them was Oliver. When I answered his letter I wondered if there would be some sense in having an information network between newsletters. It is not a problem today, but when there are more newsletters in different languages it is not so easy to read and understand given information.

I was surprised to read from _The URANTIA Book_ Synergist that for participation in the evolving international network people should contact URANTIA Book readers of Finland. As you all know by now Cece Forrester, a member of the Special Projects Comittee, is coordinating an informal network. It has no sense to waste our energy by creating several networks. Cece has already done some preliminary work and with our help and ideas a good and working informal network can be build. There are problems to be faced but with gootwill they can surely be worked out.

As mentioned in The Synergist our newsletter, Heijaste, (Reflection in English) has a list of those readers in Finland who are willing to be contacted by brothers and sisters from other countries. “The experience of many shows that one of the best ways to meet new truth seekers, to learn about other cultures and to share experiences, is to go out and meet one another on a personal basis or in small groups.”

Wish you all a new year with blessings of joy and peace and love ...

Satu Sihvo, Espoo, Finland

## French — Speaking Encounter 1988

On the initiative of Samuel BIZE a Swiss reading group is organising an encounter on July 16-23, 1988 at ABBAYE OF BONNECOMBE, CASSAGNES — BEGONHES, AVEYRON, FRANCE. Contact: Samuel and Pascaline BIZE, 1661 Estavannens, SWITZERLAND.

## Black Boxes, Red Shifts And Big Bangs

Most of us will have been confronted with television documentaries, popular science articles and even serious papers by professional scientists that tell us, without qualification, that our universe started with the Big Bang about 15 to 20 billion years ago. This information is usually presented as if it is proven fact.

URANTIA Book readers will be aware that the Book assigns an enormously greater age to the universe and makes no mention of any big bang. Undoubtedly some readers will be troubled by the contradiction, and this article is an effort to help readers to be objectively and sensibly critical about science.

The rules of the scientific method are quite simple. Few scientists heed them properly. Firstly, data used to construct a theory should be verifiable, secondly, unnecessary hypothesis should be eliminated, and thirdly, the simplest theory that explains the facts should receive priority.

Many scientists believed and most still believe that if these simple rules are followed, man will eventually comprehend all things. The reasons why this cannot be, have been known for a long time, but unfortunately are more or less ignored. I first came to grips with the problem as a young scientist when I read a book by a then well known physicist, Prof. M. Polanyi. The name of the hook was “Personal Knowledge” and it told me I could not know anything of real significance with absolute certainty. It also recommended that a probability estimate of truth between 0 and 1 accompany all scientific statements. It is a pity nobody does this for it would certainly help both scientist and layman.

Polanyi's book is probably out of print, but a recent book entitled “Godel, Escher, and Bach” by Hofstadter covers sone of the same ground. Godel's theorem .should be known to all scientists, but I doubt that 1 in 10,000 has heard of it. Paraphrased it says “All consistent axiomatic formulations of number theory include undecidable propositions”. Put another way. it says that if a formulation of number theory does not include undecidable propositions, it will be inconsistent. Undecidable means that we do not know whether they are true or false.

Number theory is at the very foundation of mathematics, which is at the very foundation of science. Hence Godel is saying all scientific theories must contain statements that cannot be shown to be true. But that does not mean they are false, simply that we cannot know. This is one of the reasons Polanyi says no scientific theory can have a probability estimate of truth of 1.0.

I think black boxes are a little easier to understand, and Shannon's formulation of black box theory has profound implications for science and certainly for the Big Bang. The black box problem investigated by Shannon was a war time one concerned with devices that were booby trapped to explode if any attempt was made to open them. For example, secret radar devices in aircraft might be set to self-destruct if an enemy scientist tried to look inside. But such a device could still be investigated by feeding it input signals and examining its output on the radar screen. The smart scientist could then guess at how it might work. Shannon's mathematical examination of the general problem of black boxes showed that though there may be a single simplest circuit or mechanism that would produce the same result, there would be an infinite number of more complex circuits that could do the same thing. In other words a black box problem does not have a single unique solution.

At first sight Shannon's finding might seem trivial. But not so, it has profound implications for all of science as science is riddled with black boxes both obvious and hidden. An example is the Big Bang theory. We cannot go backwards in time to verify exactly how the universe came about, thus we cannot open the “box”. Though a set of data may have a simple interpretation, there is no possible way of knowing if it is correct as there will be an infinite number of alternative explanations that could also be true. The origin of life is another obvious black box problem, as is the question of whether there was or is a First Cause. Also the problems of the workings of the living cell, the fine structure of the atom, the workings of the brain, etc., all have their black boxes.

The physical phenomena of the material universe do not obey the laws of science as formulated by men. They do what they did before man ever thought about them. All that man can ever do is to formulate subjective, descriptive beliefs about the observable behaviour of matter to which he must assign his own subjective probability factor regarding their truth. He cannot truthfully assign a factor of 1.0. But 0.9 or greater may be possible.

But getting back to the Big Bang, Godel and Shannon are not its only problems. There is also the quality of the data, the interpretation of the data, and the fact that it does not explain all of the observed “facts”.

In the Nov/Dec issue of 6-0-6, Richard Bain referred to a paper appearing in the Sept. issue of Scientific American concerning the large scale streaming of galaxies, from which was inferred the existence of a great gravitational attractor. Richard thought this a good name for the Isle of Paradise and also reviewed evidence that the Big Bang may have been a fizzer. The Scientific American paper is one of the many that confuses fact with hypothesis, it starts by stating, without qualification, that in the 1920 's it was SHOWN that distant galaxies ARE receding in all directions from the Earth. This “fact” eventually gave rise to the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe. let us examine a little further the “facts”.

In the 1920's Edwin Hubble and his associates measured shifts in the spectral lines of light coming from other galaxies. Hubble believed he was obtaining experimental confirmation of a theory proposed by the Dutch mathematician de Sitter, that included the proposal that spectral lines from galaxies having no relative motion to the Earth would nevertheless show a red shift that increased with distance. I am not sure whether de Sitter has ever been shown to be in error. However as time went by, one of the alternative interpretations of Hubble's results that takes an opposite view gained popular acceptance when it was found that a graph plotting the apparent brightness of galaxies against the degree of red shift showed a fairly reasonable correlation. If one then assumes that apparent brightness is a measure of distance and the red shift a measure of recessional velocity from the Earth, it is possible to extrapolate backwards in time to the moment when all matter may have been concentrated at a singularity (a dimensionless point). The explosion of the point gives us the Big Bang and the time of origin of the universe — a beautiful simple theory of great intellectual appeal. (Note that there are at least 4 unproven assumptions in this hypothesis. Grant a generous 0.7 probability factor to each and the estimate for all four being correct in the same theory comes to 0.24 , that is 24% chance of being right). Later theorists came up with the proposal that during the early expansion phase, light given off by high temperature gas should be drastically red shifted and appear today as a uniform background microwave radiation. The subsequent discovery of such a background radiation gave an enormous boost to the Big Bang theory even though, in computer simulations, no satisfactory explanation forthcoming for the formation and clustering of galaxies. The recent evidence for the clustering of the “great attractor” has made this particular problem even more disturbing for Big Bang theorists.

Other problems keep popping up for the Big Bing. One is that some quasars having very large red shifts appear to be physically connected via luminous material with galaxies having much smaller red shifts. Since it is unlikely that two such connected bodies could have enormously different recessional velocities, it is suggested that red shifts may indicate something other than recessional velocity.

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that large red shifts do not signify enormous recessional velocities for distant galaxies. Nu alternative explanation for red shifts comes from Emil Wolf of Rochester University who proposed that a spectrum can shift when certain forms of coherent light travel with their waves “in step” with one another. Recent laboratory experiments on both light and sound waves have confirmed this prediction.

What of the uniform background microwave radiation initially taken as conclusive evidence for the Big Bang? Well Hannes Alfven, Nobel prize winner for physics in 1970 believes that electro magnetic forces generated by high temperature plasma have much to do with the shaping of the galaxies, stars, and planets, and doubts the universe has ever been less than 1/10th its present size. One computer simulation of Alfven's theories has shown that plasma filaments proposed by Alfven could generate the uniform microwave background radiation, which also illustrates how right Shimnon was when he showed that in black box problems there will always be more complex interpretations that are also valid.

In another contribution to $6-0-6,1$ would like to propose from a philosophic viewpoint that _The URANTIA Book_ may have been permitted to contain serious misinformation.

## The Urantia Book In 200 Years Time

Do we ever stop to ponder as to just where _The URANTIA Book_ will be in the relatively not too distant future? Will there still be a URANTIA Brotherhood and will there still be study groups? Perhaps _The URANTIA Book_ will hold a place of honour in the average households of our society or perhaps it will be used as a text book in the public and state schools. Will it become an integrated part of society or will it be confined to a religious sect or cultish type of organization? I see that that there could be two alternative paths this revelation can take and our actions today could play a major role in determining which path it is to take.

For anyone who has totally embraced _The URANTIA Book_ I'm sure you will understand what I mean when I say that there is a natural urge to share _The URANTIA Book_ with the rest of the world. The book moves us to such a degree that there is of ten a surge of emotion which prompts us to say: “What can I do to get this book across to my fellow man?” This urge is very noble indeed. The results of this noble urge manifest in many different ways as we're all such diverse individuals. Inevitably this very noble urge within the human soul coupled with the diversity and uniqueness leads us to the “business” of sorting out which methods are wise for the Revelation, which methods should be supported by the larger organization and which ones should be rejected. As the movement evolves, so the potential for division, personality clashes, conflicts of ideas etc., etc., will eventuate.

Take a look at Christianity. A small group of people were so genuinely moved by Jesus and his teachings, that the then known world was virtually tipped upside down. There were divisions very early in the evolution of Christianity as we well know. Certain apostles who felt that others were moving away from the teachings of Jesus broke away. Perhaps the only reason Christianity took of f in the direction it did was because of individuals. Perhaps if Paul and Abner had been reversed, Abner's interpretations may have survived. The divisions in the Church are living proof of the consequences of people being driven by the same force, but disagreeing over ways and means and interpretations.

What will be the situation with _The URANTIA Book_ in 200 or 300 years time? Will we be yet another religious body fight ing and bickering amongst ourselves or will we reflect the maturity the book so wisely portrays? The decisions we make today could largely determine the answers to this question.

I feel as a group or as an organization we should be concerned with the “business” of getting _The URANTIA Book_ into those areas where people will find it. We should concentrate on increasing the supply and demand factor throughout the book trade so that the book establishes itself and can stand on its own merit. If it sells, then it will be displayed. We should concentrate on keeping the book a first hand experience. Gone are the days of Melchizedek and Salem; gone are the days of Moses and the prophets. We now have the printing press. When there were no books and people were illiterate, revelation was solely dependent on teachers and preachers to keep the flame of truth alive from generation to generation. _The URANTIA Book_ is the first Epochal Revelation since the printing press and widespread education. I think the revelation was given to us in this form without any human personality associated with it so that it could stand on its own. Our approach should be entirely different from the approach of our predecessors. As soon as we evangelize or set ourselves up as authorities of _The URANTIA Book_ we miss the point. We must differentiate between spreading the book itself and spreading the teachings of the book. To spread the teachings of the book in an “organizational” manner could be a cultish approach. The teaching should be shared by individuals in the best way they see fit. Transformed individuals will eventually be the key to a transformed world. However if an organization sets itself up to set about transforming the world, then I see untold problems for the future. The organization presumes to be an authority on the teachings and will fall into the same trap that Christianity has fallen into. The “organization” should be concerned with the business of _The URANTIA Book_ as a book only, i.e. seeing to it that the context is kept pure (hence the need for copyright), translations and also marketing the book to get it into the mainstream of society. The individuals of the organization can concern themselves with the spreading of the teachings but the organization should be careful not to get side-tracked in being too involved publicly with these activities.

I strongly feel that the Societies of the URANTIA Brotherhood should not be purchasing the book at their present discount as they are undercutting the book trade and threatening the supply and demand factor. For every book sold by a URANTIA Society member the supply and demand factor in the book trade has been weakened, which is depriving those people out there, who do not know anyone in the “organization”, of finding the book for themselves. If we keep going in this direction the survival of _The URANTIA Book_ will be dependent on the survival of the organization. We're treading on dangerous waters. We're heading in the direction of religious bodies and if we are not careful, we will lock the Revelation into that destiny.

When we become a part of an organization it is very easy to become short-sighted and put a lot of energy into the growth of that organization. The purpose of the organization can become secondary, unimportant and, in time, forgotten.

I have often read articles from readers where there is deep concern and sometimes even panic that the readership doesn't seem to be growing fast enough; that there should be more study groups, more members of the URANTIA Brotherhood, more societies and because growth is too slow, blame is aimed at the “organization”. This way of thinking is detrimental. The individuals of the organization should he more concerned with sowing seeds rather than watching for the fruits. The fruits will bear in their own time and at their own pace. The revelatory commission who put the papers of _The URANTIA Book_ together have obviously gone to a lot of trouble to create this revelation. Let's have a bit more faith that they will foster its growth as much as they can. But they can't do much if the ground work isn't done. We must pre. pare the soil and plant the seeds and nurture them and have faith that they will grow and bear fruit. Our life spans are very short. We will never see this world transformed by this revelation but we must do our bit wisely to ensure that it survives for the future when our society will be transformed by the teachings of Jesus.

I am very much in favour of having an organization to take care of the business side of things — without it we would have anarchy which would be disastrous. However I'm concerned that the organization does not grow out of proportion. Let's decide amongst ourselves the roles a group should play “as a group” and the role of the individuals within that group. There is a very big difference. For example: The URANTIA group should not get involved in politics, but wouldn't it be wonderful if our politicians were URANTIA Book readers.

Let's channel our energies into keeping _The URANTIA Book_ a first hand experience and let the Adjusters lead their companions to the truth.

## Australia Welcomed First Urantia Book Reader From Finland

Early December 187 an energetic young Laplander from Finland arrived in Melbourne. Torsti Äärelä, who is a theology student at the university in Helsinki, was travelling around Australia trying to learn as much about us Aussies as he could. After six weeks he found the number of a URANTIA Book study group listed in the Melbourne telephone directory. After a week of seeing the sights down here and meeting some readers in between he set off again, keen to experience some new adventures.

Did you know that with a population of about 5 million, Finland has about 1000 readers of _The URANTIA Book_? This coming autumn the U-Book will be presented in the teaching programme of the OPEN University of Helsinki. In July 1989 Hameenlinna in Finland will host an international conference.

## Dear friends,

Is it just a happy coincidence that you happened to send me a copy of 'Six-0-Six Newsletter' now, or did you know that I have just started editing a newsletter for readers in Britain? I think your newsletter (which I had seen once or twice before) is very inspiring, and just the sort of thing that I hope our own newsletter will grow into, if we get enough contributions from readers. For the moment we are just calling ours '_The URANTIA Book_ Study Group Newsletter"; one issue has come out so far. I plan to make it quarterly and I will certainly send you the next one.

I presume that Kathleen and Trevor Swadling suggested my name to you. In that case you will know that I'm originally from Sydney and I've known them for many years, and we still keep regular contact. We (my wife and I) were in the study group in Sydney until we last left in 1982, and we hope to meet them and you when we come to the South Pacific conference next October, which we're looking forward to very much.

You must wonder as much as I do why the circle of URANTIA Book readers in Britain is getting off the ground so slowly. There is no clear answer to this, but as in Australia, I am sure there are many more readers than there appear to be. We have one regular study group meeting in London, and in the past year another has sprung up, in Bolton near Manchester, for readers in the North.

This newsletter project of mine is aimed at keeping the readers in Britain better informed about each other, and hopefully exchanging ideas and inspirations about _The URANTIA Book_. We've also done a little library placement, on a modest scale so far. So although Britain still appears sleepy and apathetic about our Book, I'm still optimistic and I've seen some improvement in the situation since I've been here.

Congratulations again on your fine newsletter. Our warmest wishes.

Chris Moseley, Caversham, Berkshire, UK

Thank you Curt Avery for your TV Ad. I spoke to a client of mine about The URAVTIA Book. He seemed a prime candidate. But my words were no help. So I read out your ad and he bought a copy on the spot! Nh Father ... you've always 'got an ace up your sleeve. And thanks Curt, love your style.

Emmanuel Lou your writings are wonderful and amazing. As you present each article tying up _The URANTIA Book_ with Chinese traditions I can't help but reflect on the religious who travelled to India in order to bring the Buddhist scriptures back to the nation of China, as portrayed in the tales of 'Monkey'. Surely it'll be a great time on the planet when the spirit of _The URANTIA Book_ captures the hearts and minds of China.

## Reincarnation Or Repersonalization

“Personalization” means in my opinion: making or being made personal or a person. This happens for the first time when the Father bestows personality on a living organism with mind. Personality is one of the fundamental mysteries of the universe, but having its origin in the First Source and Centre, and being able to function on the absolute level while always remaining unchanged, we may infer that this majestic personality does not know itself, at least not fully. Its universe career serves to realize itself.

From this process we may infer that personality needs personalization, or identification, for self-realization. The whole universe, except the existential, needs experience and is based on that. Personality, not knowing itself, identifies itself with the organism and mind on which it is bestowed. Though this “self”-knowledge is (on our level) for the greater part erroneous, it is unavoidable and necessary. Nevertheless there is a complementary process going on, identifying with the soul. This shows that personalization is not an end in itself, it is a means to an end.

Identification with the mind-organism is automatic, identification with the soul is a struggle. Decisions, more decisions, and still more decisions... The lessons of a level must be learned before the next level can be attained. The universe is not in haste, it works slowly but thoroughly.

If a learning period has not been sufficiently successful, the process must and will be repeated. Personality has that quality through which it can be added to an organism with mind and adapt to that. The repetition of the process results in re-personalization. It depends on the identity how many times this will be repeated. The chain of personalizations may be long and arduous. Jesus admonished and taught salvation from this process, from this life to which people through mistaken evaluation attach so strongly. The end of this “first life” nearly always is survival, but we can only recognize this if we extend our horizon to cover the whole of the first life (138.3.3), which we can do only by faith. The eye of the flesh sees quite differently, the eye of faith sees that the Father's plan will succeed. His will is that nobody should be lost, that all should find salvation. And he is a patient, wise Father.

Repersonalization may resemble a bit the doctrine of reincarnation, but there are essential differences. Repersonalization starts out from the personality; reincarnation from the identity. The centre of the identity, the “I”, is in the mind. In reincarnation it is repeatedly the same mind, the same “ I ”, that supposedly incarnates. But _The URANTIA Book_ teaches that the mind is mortal, it cannot survive, because on the mansion worlds we get a new mind, a morontia mind.

If Henry Begemann, the person with whom my personality has identified itself, should not survive, he will cease to exist, will never return. But this does not implicitly mean that the personality behind the identity loses its possibility to re-identify itself with another organism with mind, thereby becoming quite another person. Cessation of life is not perse eternal extinction, thank God! It may come to that, but as far as I can see only in exceptional cases, which the procedures of page 37 sufficiently demonstrate.

Another difference with reincarnation is that the identity can only survive in the soul, which is an emerging morontia entity, though only embryonic in this life here. Hence the unavoidable necessity for survival is, to shift the centre of the identity gradually from mind to soul. This teaching with all its implications does not agree with people who are so fond of reincarnation.

Repersonalization is a universal scheme. It goes on on the mansion worlds, the first one there being called 'resurrection'. The resurrected identity is a new man, or person, with different functional powers; but through restored memory by the same Adjuster, the same identity.

The interpretation of soul-migration is at variance with the fact that we get a Though Adjuster at the age between 5 and 6. Only then a new soul comes into existence, the child of another Adjuster and another mortal mind. The soul cannot live without its parents, especially without its divine parent. The soul is mortal, with the potential of becoming immortal.

That what is gained through a life-experience, and which is of eternity-value, becomes the possession of the Adjuster. But personality itself, the unchanging and unchangeable factor behind the identity, also has a kind of memory, though not the computerlike memory of the mind. Personality, for instance, can recognize personality. Comp. p. 451. A life's experience is functional in that it affords the personality the opportunity to realize itself to a certain (sma11) extent. Everything that is truly gained is an abiding possession of the personality, which may explain in part the differential between between personalities.

Our book does not deal consecutively and extensively with this subject, and for obvious reasons. Many people are not averse at all to the material life and its pleasures. To teach them a repetition of this life would be stupid, Therefore, we also have to be careful. Our book concentrates on survival, but the sincere student will find the answers to his many questions in this field, because he is only interested in this earth life insofar it can prepare him for the next.

Of course there will remain questions, but living truth is expanding and deepening truth. The great teacher is within us.

Henry Begemann, Wassenaar, The Netherlands

## A Better World

With joyous hearts we live within your presence 
You who are everywhere around us now.
We bring you gifts of love and thanks, our presents, 
In our appreciation for your vow
To show us all of truth, although the time 
Involved may be of vast near-endless scope. 
From seeming chaos unto worlds sublime 
We'll climb while you expand our every hope. 
And yet we sense right now and all around us 
Your ordering presence making manifest 
A greater age of glory to astound us 
With your all-wondrous love. And we are blessed 
To know that even while our world is quaking 
It is a better world that you are making.

David Glass, Fort Worth, TX. USA.

Dear Friends,

Thank you for sending me the Six-0-Six. It really is a wonderful newsletter! I am particularly impressed with the fact that you publish bi-monthly. I pray that reader participation will be as active here in Canada before long. It occurred to me that publishing more often just might be the key. If you give someone four months to write an article maybe they have more t ime to forget about doing it! I wish you continued success with your newsletter and in your work for the Kingdom

## News From The. Jesusonian Foundation

The Christian Fellowship and Jesusonian Foundation have recently merged. The Christian Fellowship will now be the Division of Ministry of the Jesusonian Foundation. It will continue to be headed by its founder and executive director, Dr. Meredith Sprunger. Meredith is a minister in the United Church of Christ and a former college professor.

The Christian Fellowship will expand its efforts to bridge the gap between _The URANTIA Book_ and the Christian church. This fellowship is composed of a Clergy Network interested in _The URANTIA Book_ as a resource in preaching, teaching, and living. It is also an Academic Network engaged in research and scholarly evaluation of _The URANTIA Book_.

A new introduction to _The URANTIA Book_ has been written. It was produced by the collaborative efforts of Meredith Sprunger, Duane Faw and Mo Siegel. It has been sent to study groups for editing and improvements and once completed it will be reprinted in color.
