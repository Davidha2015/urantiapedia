## Goal Setting

Ian Esmore, Melbourne

For weeks I've been thinking of writing an article for 6-0-6 that may kindle an interest and elicit a response to attend The South Pacific Meeting of URANTIA Book readers near Sydney in October 1988. An article that may stimulate the thoughts of those readers sitting on the fence. Not enough money, can't get time off work, family commitment etc., all doubts or justifications as to why their presence is not required at a large conference gathering. If we focus on and give energy to the obstacle, then it is no wonder change does not come easily.

In front of me is a New Age Magazine with advertisements for various courses that allow people to get the results they want, to gain a clearer sense of direction, to overcome obstacles, to empower the positive aspects of ourselves.

Recently I went to an activity study retreat of two weeks duration. There were more than 70 people in attendance and many had major obstacles to overcome in order to attend. All obstacles were overcome because there was a genuine desire to experience that event and the desire was kindled by the realization of the spiritual growth and inspiration that is achievable through such gatherings.

Changing Urantia starts with first changing the attitudes in ourselves. A slight change in consciousness to envision the friendship, understanding and spiritual upliftment that comes through experiencing these gatherings and how these gifts stay with us providing inspiration and energy to go back into the world and change. Change brought about by a real experience of sharing with fellow Urantians coming together in a spirit of cooperation from all corners of Urantia.

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “The cross does stand as the token of the highest form of unselfish service, the supreme devotion of the full bestowal of a righteous life in the service of wholehearted ministry, even in death, the death of the cross.” _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 188:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/188#p5_9)

## Group worship

Some time ago, while experimenting with group worship with a few other readers, I was struck by an apparent incongruity in what we were attempting. We were taking turns in talking to God on behalf of the group, and it was clear that we were all asking God to do something, in the hope that He would thereby be influenced to do something He would not otherwise have done. For example, we were asking God to give us the wisdom to understand a certain situation, expecting that this prayer would somehow cause him to “give” us the sought-for wisdom — something He would not have done without our prayer. In other words, we were expecting God to be influenced by our prayer to depart from his normal habit and do something He would not otherwise have done.

Now a reading of paper 91, taken with Jesus' statements about prayer make it clear that God is _not_ influenced by prayer. “Man should be unafraid to talk to God, but only a spiritual child would undertake to persuade, or presume to change, God”. ([UB 91:8.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_8)) Repeatedly throughout _The URANTIA Book_ we are informed by many authors that God does _not_ change. He sees the end from the beginning and plans perfectly, and thus has no need to change. His habits reflect His plans and need no corrections. It is silly to think otherwise.

And yet we pray, asking Him for help, and we _are_ helped. We ask, and receive. What is happening?

The apparent contradiction is resolved by Jesus when he says: “Always remember that the Father knows what you need even before you ask Him” ([UB 140:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p6_11)) It is part of God's activity to be constantly making available to us whatever we really need. He is already, and ceaselessly, doing for us everything that can be done. He does not need to change, or be persuaded or influenced by our prayer in order to do this. It is part of His habit and normal functioning, whether we pray or not. The limiting factor has nothing to do with God. It is our capacity to receive Him which limits the influence of God. It is our inability to experience His influence which impedes us, not His refusal to make that influence available.

This is all made clear on pp 1001-2. When we pray we are engaging in an “auto-suggestive” process of “tuning in” our minds to the influence of God. Specific requests may or may not be part of our prayer. In any case, such requests will be answered according to our true needs, not the particular transient desires which may preoccupy us at the time. The form of the prayer is irrelevant. “God answers the soul's attitude, not the words”. ([UB 91:8.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p8_12)) And with private praying no difficulty is encountered with this.

But with group praying there is a problem. If group praying is to be something other than meditation in company, there needs to be some kind of outward form. If the activity is truly a group activity, the souls of the members of the group need to be stimulated into the required attitude in order for the minds of the group to be “tuned in” together. Some outward stimulus is needed; verbal, musical, poetic, artistic — something to stimulate the imaginations of group members into related channels at the same time.

This seems to contradict Jesus' advice about not adopting formal prayers. But it is my experience, and also that of others with whom I've spoken, that free-form verbalising usually degenerates into trying to persuade God, and is unsatisfactory from that point of view. Rarely does it seem to result in anything more than a superficial experience, and is sometimes even embarrassing.

I am very interested to hear if any other readers are concerned with this question. It seems to me that the object of group worship is for the members of the group to be communing with God together. Are there any groups who are doing this already, or experimenting? What kinds of stimuli do they find effective in attracting the differing minds of group members into the attitude of communion with God?

We are informed that “confession, repentance, and prayer have led individuals, cities, nations, and whole races to mighty efforts of reform and courageous deeds of valorous achievement”. (998:5) Surely it will help us to assist the entry of the URANTIA revelation into the world if we can develop effective forms of group worship. Our working groups will become more effective if they successfully engage in group worship. No doubt different groups will prefer different stimuli — horses for courses, as it were — but there are bound to be common elements which groups can learn from one another.

Any ideas?

## Ever Stuck For An Answer?

Can you remember how you attempted to explain to someone just “who” wrote The URANIIA Book? Do you remember the reaction to such a revelation or did it contribute to a rejection of the book?

I have always found this to be one of the first questions asked by a new reader, and in the past, one of the most difficult to answer. Very few people, in my experience, are ready to accept that a multitude of celestial beings could write a book and have it published here.

Those of us who have studied the Book and possess the added advantage of hindsight and a much expanded perception of reality, realise how relatively unimportant knowledge of authorship is in the URANTIA Revelation and rarely emphasise this matter.

Over the last decade I have solved the problem of explaining authorship of the book by saying: “I could easily reveal the authors but I would be denying you of one . of the most satisfying discoveries you can make for yourself as the authors are fully revealed within the book.” I further explain that revealing the authors would be similar to telling “who did it” in a mystery writer's book. Most agree with this explanation and I have never lost a potential new reader because of it. Hope you find this idea useful.

## Misinformation In _The Urantia Book_?

The possibility that _The URANTIA Book_ may contain serious misinformation came to me as I reflected on some of its statements about material aspects of matter and on historical events that may be shown to be untrue. Let me first affirm that I have total faith that _The URANTIA Book_ is what it claims to be, a revelation originating from divinely authorised sources.

The problem associated with belief in miracles and miraculous healing have always intrigued me. The effects of the mind on the health and healing of the body as well as the reality of the placebo effect in the healing process have become well recognized in modern medicine. _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that some of the healings associated with the ministry of Jesus were true miracles, but that many healings were due to the interaction of mind and faith with the body's own natural healing processes.

In recent times many cases of apparent miracles have been documented and vouched for by well qualified medical practitioners and many of these were associated with an act of religious faith. But with virtually all of this type of event the hardened sceptic will always find some alternative explanation other than divinely mediated healing.

What kind of healing could there be that would force sceptics to acknowledge divine intervention? Assume a man with no eyes (eyeballs physically absent) walked into a healing ministry meeting and, following a declaration of faith, instantly grew a new set of seeing eyes. Or that someone with no legs grew two new legs. Are such people less deserving than cancer sufferers, many of whom have received healing? I know of no adequately verified accounts that anyone ever grew new eyeballs or new legs. If as an immediate response to a declaration of faith in God such an event occurred, would we not be forced to acknowledge it as irrefutable evidence for the existence of God? Why then does it not happen? Why are we always left with the possibility to doubt?

_The URANTIA Book_ describes Lucifer before his fall, as a brilliant individual. Yet despite his attributes, the circumstances of his existence, and the advantages of his environment, Lucifer took the step of renouncing God the Father as a fake, the invention of his superiors to keep him in servitude. From this we must conclude that positive, irrefutable evidence for the existence of God the Father was not available, even to a finite being at the level of the Lanonandeks sons. Why? Perhaps such proof is incompatible with the degree of free will choice that God the Father wills for us and other finite beings at least to the level of the Lanonandeks. For example if there is a God whose nature is love, and our survival is dependent on honouring His will, then our will is constrained in that if we do not love one another as God loves us, our survival is not assured. To voluntarily show love purely as an act of free will without constraint, we must also be free not to believe in the existence of a God whose nature is love.

If Lucifer had the free will to doubt the existence of God the Father, then surely we must also have that free will? This is why nobody grows new eyeballs or new legs, this is why unnatural miracles do not occur, and also the reason why _The URANTIA Book_ must leave us with room for doubt. Now if all the statements in the book on subjects such as the red shift, continental drift, the timing and the course of evolution, etc., etc., turned out to be exactly correct, there would be little room for scientists with minds similar to $m y$ own to doubt the rest of the content of the book. But just one mistake makes that doubt possible and perhaps leaves us with the degree of free will choice we were meant to have. I will not be surprised if there are such errors. This does not imply that God has told us lies, that would of course be utterly impossible, It would simply mean that those who authorised the book, permitted certain harmless errors in matters of science and history to go uncorrected.

In granting us uncertainty, God also gives us the opportunity to make the ultimate freewill decision, and that is to choose to believe in and to do the will of the God Jesus called Father, even though he may not exist. A God who loves us must give us that choice.

## The Arrival Of God Into A Human Mind

When I was five years old my six year old brother and I were taken to one of the churches in our small country town by our parents. Mum had been told by her careers advising father that I was to grow up to be a minister: “So expose him to the church, won't you!” ... and she did just that, rather zealously.

### The. First Step Upon The Path

This particular Sunday was quite an occasion for this church. It was the day to host a visiting evangelical troupe “on a mission from God”. The troupe comprised about eight people and the speaker, who spoke to a packed audience for some time. He probably covered a great many aspects of the Christian gospel, most of it going over my head, but impressed me very deeply with a single issue the idea of the reality of God, the personal author of everything.

This ‘God’ sounded to me like the best darn thing going. Everyone ought to have some of it in their lives. This fellow up there on the platform was like someone selling water beside the river ... God was free and available to everyone and was present and immediate and hey why don't you go and grab a good bucketful?

In a very real sense this evangelist spoke as if he was introducing our town to a wholly new product, a 'thing' that nobody but nobody here had ever come across; like when Coke first arrived in New Zealand, it changed our whole way of life and was the herald of greater things to come. For me, looking around at the townsfolk in the congregation as they sat glued to this speaker, God was a new and fresh revelation. My reality was the complete contrary to Paul's writing ([Romans 1:19,20](/en/Bible/Romans/1#v19)), “... since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. For since the creation of the world God's invisible qualities — his eternal power and divine nature have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made, so that men are without excuse.” (NIV version) I had not the slightest inclination that there was a cod. My self-identity had only the scope to recognize that adults rule the roost, and mum and dad in particular.

### The First Realization — And Disappointment

During this speech I came to the conclusion that I wanted God, in a big way. For the first time in my brief life span I felt the difference between myself in my local reality — the sky was simply blue, the trees and fields simply green — and myself and God in the same reality there was a wholeness, the creator was IN the creation, there was a sense of completion inside me and an all-pervading orderliness in the world around me.At least that's how I thought about it at the time.

After the church service the congregation was divided into discussion groups and one each of those people from the evangelical troupe attended each group. Just before our group for the littlest kids was about to begin I went to our evangelist to ask her what felt for me to be the most important question of $m y$ life, “Excuse me Miss ... what's God?”

I needed an answer that came from her actual God-Mind, in the same way one expects the seller of a product to vouch for it based on their own experience of having used it ... endorsing it because they have an intimate and inside knowledge of it from experience. But my question was met quite differently. She looked down at me like a stunned mullet and said, in a manner that was obviously sincere, “I don't know ...”.

My response was immediate and final. Here before me was a hypocrite, a living lie. She was telling us all how wonderful this God thing was and how we really ought to get it into our lives “cos it'11 fix everything and it's just the bestest darn thing imaginable and you'd be a real fool not to get some and if you hang in with us you'll be right all-right you betcha!” And she didn't have a clue about it at all! And that cut me to the quick. I rejected Christianity and Christians outright.

### The Desire Continues

Curiously though her hypocracy didn't disturb my thirst for God, it just told me to be wary of that particular crowd because they didn't know anything about it, they didn't have any God in stock. I decided then and there, while our group was going through its somewhat empty ritual, that I would find God from someplace else ... probably not from people, maybe from God himself. I figured out that if there really was such a thing as God and he was the creator of all this life around me and in me, and he did in fact know $m y$ every thought and feeling, then he'd help me find him. But I certainly wouldn't find him through this lot.

The following Tuesday I was at school and after lunch we went out to the sports field to watch a softball match being played by our school and a visiting school. We five year old prime-grade kids were lined up along one side of the open field just at the tree line. There we sat down to watch what I found to be a rather boring event. The game didn't involve me and I didn't know anyone playing, they were either strangers or, being older than I was, were not my playmates. I was curious as to why we should be watching at all. The whole game had absolutely nothing to do with us at all. There was something quite incongruent about our being there. As I looked around at my classmates I noticed that they were as apparently bored and feeling out of place as was I. But then that all changed.

Overhead in the sky above the playing field and at about a hundred feet altitude came a silvery coloured sort of flying craft. It was about the size of a couple of Nash Rambler cars, wide and long, shaped a bit like two saucers placed one on the other. It seemed to pulsate with a silvery vibrancy. Boy, did it ever change the tone of the game!

### Childlike Faith And Trust

Out of the craft came quite a number of flying people. They were very brightly coloured and shining and drifted. onto the playing field where they began giving out small sachets of sweets and cuddling all the kids and the two teachers as if they were long lost friends of theirs. All of the kids beside me ran onto the field, for the game had come to an abrupt stop when all of this happened out of the blue. I just stood up where I had been sitting and from the edge of the playing field by the trees I watched, not too surprised, just fascinated. I had never seen anyone like these people before.

After a short while of these greetings some of the flying people went back up to the craft hovering over the field. Then from within this craft came a big fellow. He was about three people tall and shone with a brilliant rosy colour all through him. He was sort of human-like, but not quite. He wasn't like the flying people who in a sense seemed a bit like people, he didn't have any limbs or face as such but was more like an oval shaped light which was alive and in some indefinable sense was a person. He, like all the flying people with wing-like things on their backs, was aglow with friendship and kindness.

### The Meeting

He glided over from the craft to the space just above me and in front, I had to look up at him. Then he greeted me by my name and so I asked him who he was. He replied, “God Robert. You asked for me and I have come to be with you.”

Well I was thrilled. Not overwhelmed or in any way disturbed, just delighted to meet God face to face. It was a special day for all of us, what with all the sweets and seeing these flying people and so on, but it was also so very ordinary somehow, so straight forward.

This ‘God’ and I had a chat for quite a while as he stayed motionless in the space before me. I don't recall the content of that conversation. But then he turned around and faced the craft and I noticed that all the flying people were leaving the field and gathering back inside their transport. One by one they were saying their farewells to $m y$ schoolmates and gliding back up to the craft a hundred feet above the field. They seemed to be going to leave and yet this ‘God’, this rosy coloured fellow seemed to be staying.

He said something to them all once they were in their craft, as if communicating right through its walls to them, thanking them and expressing love for them. The atmosphere was electric with affection. Then I noticed that beside the craft there was another person. He was without any form at all, he was like a powerful clear-light presence. It seemed that he had accompanied the craft and was somehow int innately related to ‘God’. After this rosy chap had said his goodbye to those in the craft, with such absolute finality to it, he turned his attention to this clear light presence, this consciousness which was motionless beside the craft. There followed the deepest stillness and love between these two that I have ever known, remaining in this silent rapport for some time. It was as if nothing of any significance could happen in all the world until this rapport had parted, such was its omnipotence. But it did part, and the one beside the craft shot straight out across the horizon in a split second. Cone.

### Indwelling The Mind

Then the craft moved off across the horizon, in a different direction from the clear light one, at a much slower speed but still disappearing in the blink of an eye. I was alone with this rosy one, ‘God’. He had turned to face the craft in order to say his farewells, and now he came directly above me and descended slightly so that we began to merge ourselves. It was as if I had become a white egg-shaped form, a little larger than my body, and his rosy form was blending in through $m y$ head and down into my body. It was as if the stuff we were both made of was the same and he just moved on into it permeating every part of me. I distinctly knew the addition to me. There was someone else within me. And as I looked out across the playing field where now the teachers and kids were gathering up all the sports equipment I knew irrefutably that this one who had entered within me was indeed God. The world showed itself to be his, it was his product, in the same way that a mother looks upon her child and knows with her whole being that this is hers, it is from her, she is its source.

Then there was a short time, almost of experimentation, as ‘God’ and I became as one person without distinction. We fluctuated in and out of separation, God and me, just me, God and me, just me, until there was just me and no longer any 'wobble' of separation.

Then I felt someone tugging on my shirt at my right shoulder. I turned to look and I found myself lying on the ground, where we had originally sat down, and one of my classmates was giving me a gentle kick to wake me so I could join the rest of our class who were lining up beside the trees in order to go back to the classroom and then home. The party was over. But I was quite excited and I asked the boy who had been beside me, “Did you get any lollies?” And he said yes. This experience for me had been absolutely real, within the experience of my mind as well as within the experience of my physical reality. His reply confirmed for me that the whole event wasn't just a dream but in fact the flying people had indeed come to us, and God was within me now whereas the Sunday before he was not.

### Accepting The Arrival

When ‘God’ was descending into me I remember thinking, “Oh this is how God comes to people. When you're five years old God turns up and enters inside you and lives with you from the inside. And that's how he gets to hear your every prayer and your every thought. And that's how come he can know you as you really are, and love you for what you are and what you try to do. And that's how you come to know God, from the inside, not from wading through a book or practising some superstition in the hope of attracting him from outside you and far away”.

My experience showed me that God lived and breathed my life right there with me, but at five years old I had no idea why he should do that. I had no theology, no philosophy ... the biggest thing in my life was trying to kick a full size football without busting my big toe! The arrival of God was so ordinary, so everyday an occurrence at the time, and I simply didn't have the needs that emerge with growing up. The arrival of God into me was a simple affair, unquestioned, fully accepted.

But of course God then disappeared from sight and as I grew older I was among the many who kicked the stubborn lawn mower uttering oaths like, 'If there really is a God, you'll start this mower right now!“ And I'd heartily yank on the starter cord again, to no avail. And then when it finally would start, having firmly denounced God's reality, I'd backtrack and say to myself, ”See, there really is a God!" I'm thankful faith is not founded on such childish appraisals of the nature of things.

### Looking Back

It would be some eighteen years later that I would find a URANTIA Book and read page 1187 to find such a correlation between it and my early experience. Whether my experience happened 'for real', physically, is anybody's guess. I doubt it. The boy beside me whom I asked about the lollies may have been $m y$ own projection whilst I was 'waking up'. Perhaps we did indeed share a common experience, all of us, in a part of our makeup which has a knowing and has responses to life seemingly independent of our conscious involvement with life. Meditative and especially stable and real spiritual mystical experience certainly confirms this. But one thing is sure. The Thought Adjuster does arrive, and does enter into the mind of the child, and does interface with the mind at a superconscious level ... the same level that all authentic mystical experience occurs at, and it does occur at a definite time and on a definite day, and it is the result of a provoked interest in making the value of goodness and truth active. So it has to happen somehow. We each have to experience it somehow, with the stuff we're made from.... the same stuff that grows to thirst for mature truth and longs to be like God and as God. Spiritual hunger is real, more real than life itself. Spiritual satisfaction is real, it is not a fantasy, a myth, a desperate hope. And it has to happen somehow within us, there has to be something within us which has a direct and immediate connection with God... otherwise our body and our mind could never know it. How wonderful to gaze at the five year olds in the school playground, soon to receive their most precious secret.

> “There is a reality in religious experience that is proportional to the spiritual content, and such a reality is transcendent to reason, science, philosophy, wisdom, and all other human achievements. The convictions of such an experience are unassailable; the logic of religious living is incontrovertible; the certainty of such knowledge is superhuman; the satisfactions are superbly divine, the courage indomitable, the devotions unquestioning, the loyalties supreme, and the destinies final — eternal, ultimate, and universal.”

## Why?

Why do we wait till a person's gone 
Before we tell his worth?
Why do we wait, why not tell him now
He's the finest man on earth?
Why do we wait till a person's gone
To send him flowers galore,
When a single rose would have meant so much
If we'd taken it to his door?
Why do we wait till he cannot hear
The good things that we might say?
Why put it off, why not tell him now
And share in his joy today?
Of course we're busy, that's our excuse, 
But why, oh why do we wait
To tell a person our love for him 
Until it become too late?

## Ingredients For Problem Solving

How fortunate we are to have problems in our lives.Upheavals to cope with, illnesses to bear, family pressures and arguments, differing opinions thrown at us from all sides. Unemployment.

Ever feel that you are “caught in the middle”? Can't cope?

Pressures at work, more decisions to make. The irate customer to deal with — and the anxious and uncertain one. Deadlines to meet. Stress. Tension.

Critical illness of a child or someone close to you. And, also, the loneliness following the parting on this earth with a loved one.

Do you ever feel that you can't take much more?

of course we can take heaps more.

It is through coping with life's problems and challenging situations that we learn to make decisions and obtain the opportunity to grow. Learning understanding and tolerance are just by-products.

In answer to Simon's question “Why are some persons so much much more happy and contented than others? Is contentment a matter of religious experience?”, Jesus answered “.... Much of man's sorrow is born of the disappointment of his ambitions and the wounding of his pride ... All too many of man's troubles take origin in the fear soil of his own natural heart. ... Seek not, then, for false peace and transient joy but rather for the assurance of faith and the sureties of divine sonship which yield composure, contentment, and supreme joy in the spirit”. ([UB 149:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p5_3))

How did Jesus teach his apostles to solve their problems? He taught them to face them, talk about them together, but most inportantly to share them with our Heavenly Father. Sometimes Jesus sent them to visit family and friends, or he took them out into the hills or by the seaside, away from the pressures of the crowds and their daily lives. Together they would simply enjoy each-other's company and relax with. nature. Sometimes he even forbade them to mention the crisis at hand.

On their return, they always found out that that which had seemed insurmountable had faded in significance because of their increased resources to cope. He assured them that “Since your lives have been lived in the spirit and for the Father, nothing can be of serious concern to you. Kingdom builders, the accredited citizens of the heavenly worlds, are not to be disturbed by temporal upheavals or perturbed by terrestrial cataclysms. What does it matter to you who believe this gospel of the kingdom if nations overturn, the age ends, or all things visible crash, since you know that your life is the gift of the Son, and that it is eternally secure in the Father? Having lived the temporal life by faith and having yielded the fruits of the spirit as the righteousness of loving service for your fellows, you can confidently look forward to the next step in the eternal career with the same survival faith that has carried you through your first and earthly adventure in sonship with God.” ([UB 176:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/176#p3_2))

Jesus “lived in the midst of stress and storm, but he never wavered”. ([UB 149:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/149#p4_5)) How did he solve his own problems? Remember what he did after the healing at sundown? or before his trial? Or before the Capernaum crisis?

Rodan of Alexandria made the observation: “But the greatest of all methods of problem solving I have learned from Jesus, your Master. I refer to that which he so consistently practices, and which he has so faithfully taught you, the isolation of worshipful meditation. In this habit of Jesus' going off so frequently by himself to commune with the Father in heaven is to be found the technique, not only of gathering strength and wisdom for the ordinary conflicts of living, but also of appropriating the energy for the solution of the higher problems of a moral and spiritual nature”. ([UB 160:1.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_10))

> “This worshipful practice of your Master brings that relaxation which renews the mind; that illumination which inspires the soul; that courage which enables one bravely to face one's problems; that self-understanding which obliterates debilitating fear; and that consciousness of union with divinity which equips man with the assurance that enables him to dare to be Godlike. The relaxation of worship, or spiritual communion as practiced by the Master, relieves tension, removes conflicts, and mightily augments the total resources of the personality.” ([UB 160:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/160#p1_12))

And we, 2000 years later, still live in the midst of stress and storm. only the location and times have changed. The assurance of personal faith and relationship with God is all we need to get through.

Being able to draw on the bank of faith which we have given to us is a function which has no end. And the miraculous part about it is, that the more we draw on it, the larger and stronger it becomes! Not like my bank account!

How sublimely confident we struggling mortals are, to have such assurance and comfort of the Spirit. “Jesus portrayed the profound surety of the God-knowing mortal when he said: “To a God-knowing kingdom believer, what does it matter if all things earthly crash?" Temporal securities are vulnerable, but spiritual sureties are impregnable. When the flood tides of human adversity, selfishness, cruelty, hate, malice, and jealousy beat about. the mortal soul, you may rest in the assurance that there is one inner bastion, the citadel of the spirit, which is absolutely unassailable; at least this is true of every human being who has dedicated the keeping of his soul to the indwelling spirit of the eternal God.” ([UB 100:2.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p2_7))

> “And throughout every trial and in the presence of every hardship, spirit-born souls are sustained by that hope which transcends all fear because the love of God is shed abroad in all hearts by the presence of the divine Spirit.” ([UB 34:6.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p6_13))

> “God-knowing individuals are not discouraged by misfortune or downcast by disappointment. Believers are immune to the depression consequent upon purely material upheavals spirit livers are not perturbed by the episodes of the material world. Candidates for eternal life are practitioners of an invigorating and constructive technique for meeting all of the vicissitudes and harassments of mortal living.” ([UB 156:5.13](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_13))

So let us revel in the fact that we are beset with problems and stress. Let us draw on our faith, and let us dare to use our oars of religion and revelation which have been dedicated to us, so that we may direct our lives to the will of God as we grow and share and ascend together.

## Turning It Over In My Mind

I sometimes awake hefore dawn, and having satisfied the calls of nature, return to bed to lie quietly with my mind going through the motions of listening to the Thought Adjuster. While I don't know what that means, I am sure it is essential to keep the body still for a start. My mind drifts off into some analytical or planning sequence, and I let go of the consciousness of the Thought Adjuster. The mind sequence eventually reaches an impasse, and, as if to pass the buck, the mind wakes up the body, forcing it to turn over. The mind now has to cope with the task of conforting the body, and the impasse is put 'out of mind' for the time being. If the body refuses to be comforted another impasse arises, and the mind wrenches the body over again, leading to the familiar 'tossing and turning' pattern.

One morning recently I was shown this correlation between the mental impasse and the sudden feeling of bodily discomfort which leads to body movement — turning over. The way 'through the impasse' is evidently for the higher level of the mind to recognise the peevishness and frustration of the lower level of the mind in time to block its call to the body which is really quite comfortable as it is. It is a similar activity perhaps to the art of curtailing an unwanted dream without waking.

The article by Kathleen Swadling was great. Especially that last part about URANTIA Groups staying out of politics, but wouldn't it be nice if our politicians read _The URANTIA Book_? It might make real statesmen of them — instead of mere politicians, which some are,

## U-Book II ?

The other day I received a phone call from a lady working at one of the bookstores in Melbourne which sells URANTIA Books.

“I just wanted to check with you,” she said. “A customer came in yesterday and told me that there is a follow-up to _The URANTIA Book_. Is there any truth in that?” was her question. I couldn't help smiling to myself as I answered: 'No, there isn't. There is a Concordex and a Paramony,“ and I explained what they were, how to use them and how to obtain them. ”But there certainly is no follow-up to _The URANTIA Book_."
