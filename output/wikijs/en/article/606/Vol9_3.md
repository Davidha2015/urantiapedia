## A Note From The 6-0-6 Team

Programmes for the South Pacific Regional Meeting of URANTIA Book Readers, which will be held at Ranelagh House, Robertson, N.S.W. on 10th — 14th October 1988 have been sent out. It promises to be a great event. Kathleen Swadling reports that there are still vacancies for people who have not as yet registered, but would like to do so. Contact:

Ken and Betty Glasziou from Maleny, Qld, attended the first Scientific Symposium for students of _The URANTIA Book_, which was held at Nashville, Tennessee, USA, on May 13-15. We hope to bring you their report in our next issue.

Christopher and Bridget Billington from W-Tree near Buchan, Vic. have left for a holiday in the U.K. and hope to visit some U.B. readers both in England and Finland as well as calling in at Findhorn in Scotland.

If you think the URANTIA Movement in Australia has been very quiet lately, you are right. We seem to have gone underground. But the books are mushrooming everywhere. The sale of 200 books in 14 months through our bookfloat proves you can't keep a good thing down. Also study group activities in Melbourne and elsewhere are growing steadily. One roving study group is attracting quite a few young families who are all very keen to take their turn in hosting the group.

From W-Tree we heard that one new member of the study group works as a radio operator on one of the Kingfisher Rigs in Bass Strait. He was relating how the inter-rig helicopter took a URANTIA Book as its cargo on the journey up and A Course of Miracles on its return flight. Talking about mushrooming everywhere!

In Queensland folks are meețing regularly at Joe Hausler's place in Eumundi near Nambour (for overseas readers information — that is pineapple country!)

Sydney has a few new members in its group and your editor visited our friends Peter and Sue Webb, and Allan \& Jayne Lane in Perth just recently. We held an interesting discussion on the certainty of God's existence.

## Evidence of Things Unseen

The inner worlds are constantly revealing themselves to us. Too often, however, we fail to make the connection that would enable us to recognise the work of the forces of light.

The two separate events described below offer examples of the way in which unseen, and beneficient powers can make an impact on the physical world and produce evidence of their existence.

The first is from a moving passage in Malcolm Muggeridge's book 'Something Beautiful for God' -an account of the life and work of Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

The book describes something that happened while the author was in Calcutta with a film crew making a documentary on Mother Teresa. The entire process of making the film appeared to be blessed by an unseen hand. A fifty-five minute documentary would normally take two to three months to shoot — in this case, the crew had only five days. And yet, in spite of the pressure to get everything done in time, “the filming proceeded with quite exceptional smoothness and speed ... there were none of the usual breakdowns. and crises. no bickering and quarrelling”. Malcolm Muggeridge comments that anyone with any experience of filming expeditions would recognize this as “a kind of miracle”. But, he adds, “there was another actual miracle”.

The Sisters of Mercy gather dying people from the streets of Calcutta and bring them to their Home for the Dying where they are surrounded by an atmosphere of love and cared for. The Home has very small windows, high up on the wall — it is dark inside and the lighting very poor. The film director insisted that it was impossible to film in such light, but as there was no time to fetch and set up proper lights he went ahead anyway but took the precaution of filming in a courtyard outside where other inmates were sitting in the full light of the sun. When the film was processed, however, the result was quite the reverse of what it should have been: “the part taken inside was bathed in a particularly beautiful soft light; whereas the part taken outside was rather dim and confused”. The Director insists that there is no technical explanation for the quality of light in the film.

Malcolm Muggeridge's explanation of this act of the unseen forces is illuminating. “I myself am absolutely convinced that the technically unaccountable light is, in fact, the Kindly Light Newman refers to in his well-known exquisite hymn ... Mother Teresa's Home for the Dying is overflowing with love, as one senses immediately on entering it. This love is luminous, like the haloes artists have seen and made visible round the heads of the saints. I find it not at all surprising that the luminosity should register on a photographic film. The supernatural is only an infinite projection of the natural, as the furthest horizon is an image of eternity... One thing everyone who has seen the film seems to be agreed about is that the light in the Home for the Dying is quite exceptionally lovely. This is, from every point of view, highly appropriate ... the Home for the Dying... could not be more restful and serene. So, the light conveys perfectly what the place is really like; an outward and visible luminosity manifesting God's inward and invisible omnipresent love. This is precisely what miracles are for to reveal the inner reality of God's outward creation.”

The other tale of the forces of light impressing themselves on the world of form is also taken from the experiences of a film maker. This time the event occurred in Tibet where, in a valley in the shadows of the sacred Mt. Kailash, an Australian crew were filming a local Buddhist ceremony celebrating Wesak. The ceremony had never been filmed before. Again, everything flowed perfectly and through apparent coincidences the crew found themselves “led” to the ceremony. The camera being used was powered by batteries and in the extreme cold the batteries were only lasting for two or three rolls of film before they had to be changed. During the ceremony, however, one set of batteries powered a whole day's filming. The cameraman found it difficult to believe what was happening — but each time he checked the batteries the camera showed they were still charged: “I just kept filming. It was such an impressive sight. Twenty rolls passed and I thought this is really odd. The batteries hadn't been changed, but the camera was functioning so I didn't bother about it and just went on.” There is no technical explanation why the camera worked on those batteries in such freezing temperatures — yet it did work to capture a unique ceremony which was later featured in a film broadcast on Australian television that presented the idea of the Wesak Festival as a universal festival for all humanity.

Film and television provides a unique medium for the revelation of the unseen powers of light and love. As technology develops it is fascinating to ponder on the mysteries of the universe that we will discover through these tools of communication.

Loving means to love that which is unlovable, or it is no virtue at all; forgiving means to pardon the unpardonable, or it is no virtue at all; faith means believing the unbelievable, or it is no virtue at all. And to hope means hoping when things are hopeless, or it is no virtue at all.

## Two Remarkable Predictions

The URANTIA Papers contain accounts of the physical structure of the Universe, the formation and evolution of the Solar system, the evolution of life, and the subsequent evolution and history of man some of which does not accord with currently held views of scientists. In contrast, there is much in the Book that was highly speculative at the time of receipt of the URANTIA Papers (1934) that has since turned out to be correct.

In my view there are two commentaries that are quite outstanding in that their chances of being correct were infinitely small excepting that they were based upon a pre-existing bank of knowledge. One of these commentaries refers to atomic structure. The other concerns continental drift. There are, of course, many other remarkable comments, but, to me, these two, by themselves, tell me that I have to take seriously, the claims of _The URANTIA Book_ to be a new revelation.

Quoting from [UB 41:8.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/41#p8_3) we read as follows: “In large suns when hydrogen is exhausted and gravity contraction ensures, and such a body is not sufficiently opaque to retain the internal pressure of support for the outer gas regions, then a sudden collapse occurs. The gravity-electric changes give origin to vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential, and such particles readily escape from the solar interior thus bringing about the collapse of a gigantic sun within a few days.”

No tiny particles devoid of electric charge were known to exist in 1934, and certainly none that could escape readily from the star's interior under the conditions being considered In fact such particles were not shown to exist until 1956, one year after the publication of _The URANTIA Book_. The existence of particles that might have such properties had been put forward as a suggestion by Wolfgang Pauli in 1932, because studies on radioactive beta decay of atoms had indicated that a neutron could decay to a proton and an electron, but measurements had shown that the combined masses of the electron and proton did not add up to the mass of the neutron. To account for the missing mass, Pauli suggested a little neutral particle was emitted, and then, on the same day, while lunching with the eminent astrophysicist Walter Baade, Pauli commented that he had done the worst thing a theoretical physicist could possibly do, he had proposed a particle that could never be discovered because it had no properties. However, not long after, the great Enrico Fermi took up Pauli's idea and attempted to publish a paper on the subject in the journal Nature, which is where scientists like to make their spectacular suggestions. The editors rejected Fermi's paper on the grounds that it was too speculative. This was in 1933, the year before receipt of the relevant URANTIA document.

Now an interesting thing to note is that the URANTIA Paper says that tiny particles devoid of electric charge would be released in vast quantities during the collapse of the star. If the author had in mind the formation of a neutron star, another wildly speculative proposal from Zwicky and Baade, then surely he was thinking about the reversal of beta decay in which a proton, an electron and Pauli's little neutral particle would be squeezed together to form a neutron. Radioactive beta decay can be written:

neutron $\longrightarrow$ proton + electron + LNP

where LNP stands for ‘little neutral particle’, Hence the reverse should be:

LNP + electron + proton $\longrightarrow$ neutron

For this to occur an electron and a proton have to be compressed to form a neutron but somehow they would have to add a little neutral particle in order to make up for the missing mass. Thus, in terms of available speculative knowledge in 1934, the URANTIA Paper appears to have put things back to front, it has predicted a vast release of LNP's, when it should have been mopping them up.

The idea of a neutron star was classified along with other gee-whiz science fiction right up until 1967 Most astronomers believed that stars, from average size like our sun up to very massive stars, finished their lives as white dwarfs. The theoretical properties of neutrons stars were just too preposterous; for example, a thimble full would weigh 100 million tonnes; and so large stars were presumed to blow off their surplus mass a piece at a time until they got below the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses, when they could retire as respectable white dwarfs. This process did not entail the release of vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric charge as mentioned in _The URANTIA Book_.

Let us move now to [UB 42:8.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p8_1) of _The URANTIA Book_, the section on sub-atomic physics. Firstly, note that the word mesotron is used to denote a carrier that shuffles backwards and forwards between neutrons and protons in the nucleus of the atom, carrying both energy and positive electric charge and serving to help bond the nucleus together. In 1934 there was no word to signify this carrier, but it was given the name ‘meson’ in 1935 by the Japanese physicist, Yukawa, who first proposed the theory. Further down the page, the word mesotron is used a second time in discussing the radioactive disintegration of the neutron in which it is stated that the neutron decays to a proton and a mesotron and that the latter subsequently decays to yield an electron and a small uncharged particle. This particle could be identified with Pauli's and Fermi's little neutral particles that later became known as neutrino's.

_The URANTIA Book_ is obviously discussing two different mesotron energy carriers, one the carrier of positive charge between proton and neutron, the other the carrier of negative charge from neutron to electron. Many, many years passed, and many different theories became extinct before the characteristics of these two carriers were sorted out. The carrier of positive charge was detected and named the pion in 1946. The carrier of negative charge became known as W-, and remained a theoretical construct until 1983, when it was finally detected.

The idea of anti-matter and negative energy was introduced by that great physicist, Paul Dirac in about 1930. and this also was thought by many to be science fiction material. Eventually the idea achieved respectability, and modern theories proclaim that every sub-atomic particle has an antiparticle, and that includes Pauli's little neutral particle, the neutrino. Its anti-particle is called the anti-neutrino, and both are tiny uncharged particles that to date have not been shown to have detectable mass. Modern quantum theory requires that the absorption of an anti-neutrino is effectively the same thing as the emission of a neutrino. Modem theory also tells that beta decay is really: 

neutron $\longrightarrow$ proton + W-

W- $\longrightarrow$ electron + anti-neutrino

This is the reaction described in _The URANTIA Book_ as breakdown of the mesotron energy carrier to electron and small, uncharged particles, the theory for which was worked out in the late 1960s by Weinberg and Salam. The theory proposed a pair of charge carriers, W- + W+, and a neutral energy carrier, 2. The theory on which they were based (gauge theory) required that the particles be massless, which also meant they would act over infinite distance. This was wrong because the weak force of beta decay was known to act only over the extremely small distances within the atomic nucleus. Weinberg and Salam eventually got around the difficulty by introducing another field, the Higgs field, in which Higg's particles coalesced with W & Z and endowed them with mass. All of this remained gee-whiz theoretical physics until a Dutchan, Gerhardt Hooft, showed that the theory was renormalisable, which really is a neat mathematical trick to get rid of unwanted infinities. Hooft's' results were sufficiently exciting to set the experimental physicists searching for the $W \& Z$ particles, and these were duly found in 1983, perhaps the most significant discovery of physics in the last 50 yrs. The work resulted in the Nobel prize to Weinberg and Salam, also Glashow who was involved in the very early work.

For the gravity contraction of large suns described in _The URANTIA Book_ as “giving origin to vast quantities of tiny particles devoid of electric potential which readily escape from the solar interior thus bringing about the collapse of a gigantic sun within a few days”, the sub-atonic reaction that comes about is the squeezing together of electrons and protons to form neutrons. Whereas anti-neutrinos are released in beta decay, during star collapse when a proton and an electron are squeezed together to form a neutron, it is a neutrino that is released. Both the anti-neutrino and the neutrino are tiny uncharged particles, just as described in _The URANTIA Book_.

There is another remarkable statement on the remarkable page 479. At the end of the section on atomic cohesion we are told that whereas the mesotron explains certain cohesive properties of the atomic nucleus, it does not explain cohesion of proton to proton and neutron to neutron. It then tells us that the powerful force that does this is as yet undiscovered on Urantia.

In 1934, the proton and the neutron were thought of as fundamental particles. There was no need for any other binding force than Yukawa's meson to account for the stability of the atomic nucleus, and _The URANTIA Book_'s powerful force was an enigma. This situation continued until, in the 1950's, a multitude of new particles called hadrons were discovered. Eventually physicists were forced to consider that all these particles, including the proton and neutron, were really made up from even smaller particles. In 1963, a theory was put forward giving these new particles the name quark, but it took another 10 to 15 years before a respectable theory had developed with adequate experimental support. By 1979, the powerful undiscovered force of [UB 42:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p8_6) of _The URANTIA Book_ was firmly established as a force mediated by particles called gluons that were responsible for the binding together of the quarks that made up the proton, neutron and other hadrons. So again _The URANTIA Book_ was correct in telling us of the existence of this undiscovered force that appeared to be totally unnecessary in 1934.

It is probably difficult for the modern generation to realize what a remarkable thing it is for _The URANTIA Book_ to have accurately described these particles and forces in 1934, or for that matter, 1955. The basis of these discoveries is quantum theory, now having general acceptance, but in the 1930 's, it was vigorously opposed by such men as the great Albert Einstein, and even most of its founders regarded it as a makeshift mathematical invention that would soon be displaced by something more sensible. One of its most important founders was Edwin Schrodinger, who at a later stage in his life found the theory so bizarre that he stated that he wished he had never had anything to do with it. And even today, quantum theory reads more like something out of Alice in Wonderland than a serious scientific theory. The neutron 'star also was more of a science fiction scenario until, in 1967, the orbiting Einstein X-ray Observatory beamed back pictures of the neutron star at the centre of the Crab nebula, confirming observations made by radiotelescopes, and forcing astronomers to take seriously, that which previously had been regarded as science fiction.

In describing correctly the release of the neutrino in neutron star formation and anti-neutrino in beta radioactive decay as well as inferring the reality of the neutron star, the authors of The URANIIA Papers stayed marginally within their instructions not to reveal anything that was not already conjectured by Earth scientists. As far as I am aware, the additional force to Yukawa's meson for maintaining the
stability of the atomic nucleus was not proposed until at least the late 1950 's. However, in 1934, for any Earth scientist, posing as a revelator, to guess at the existence of anything as unlikely as neutrinos, anti-neutrinos, neutron stars, and the undiscovered nuclear force would have been sheer stupidity. But perhaps no more stupid than the next remarkable guess, the theory of continental drift.

Ken will discuss the second remarkable prediction: CONTINENTAL DRIFT.

## Doing God's Will

Not long ago I had a conversation with a devout Roman Catholic who shared a house with a “born again” Radical Christian. He was disconcerted by the Radical's habit of doing all sorts of odd things “because God told me to”. He eventually came to the conclusion that the Radical was using the conviction of divine guidance to justify his own prejudices and preconceptions, and to avoid doing the intellectual work of adjusting his ideas to the reality of his experience. Anytime a problem arose it would be dealt with by a direct and immediate appeal to God. The impulsive “solution” which then came to mind was invested with absolute authority (“God told me”) and further discussion of the question was rendered irrelevant.

It is not difficult to imagine some of the problems which could grow out of this kind of procedure. But nevertheless it has procedure may be summarized as:

I have a problem.

What does God want me to do about it?

Ask Him.

Receive His answer.

Put it into practice.

This seems a reasonable way of substituting God's will for one's own selfish will. Furthermore, a great many people have had experiences where this procedure works.

The difficulty with the procedure, however, is that there is no infallible way of distinguishing between di vine guidance on the one hand, and personal subconscious desires on the other. The discussion of “Erroneous Concepts of Adjuster Guidance” on p. 1207:7 makes clear the difficulties associated with interpreting divine guidance, and warns us to be extremely cautious of attributing impulses or opinions to that source. Guidance is rarely given in the precise terms in which it is sought, but rather in accordance with our “true needs” as assessed by our indwelling Adjuster, which in any case is limited by our inability to comprehend whatever message it may direct towards our conscious mind. To rely on divine guidance for specific solutions to specific problems is to run the risk of being greatly mistaken about God's will. This is NOT to deny that there are times when this procedure may be appropriate, but rather to remind ourselves that it is a procedure of last resort, for matters of great significance, when all other techniques have proved fruitless.

Jesus taught that “The Spirit of the Father speaks best to man when the human mind is in an attribute of true worship” ([UB 146:2.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/146#p2_17)) Worship, as opposed to prayer, implies the absence of any specific request for guidance. In other words, the divine influence is most effective when we are NOT seeking help for any specific decision.

On [UB 37:6.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/37#p6_3) a Brilliant Evening Star points out that the keynote of the education system of Nebadon is “character acquired by enlightened experience”. Having formed a definite desire to do God's will, we augment character by acting upon that desire, by making decisions that we imagine God wants us to. But prayer and worship are not directly connected to specific decisions. Prayer and worship take place regularly, and the habit of communing with God is maintained, but specific decisions are taken without seeking for particular guidance over that particular decision. The attempt to achieve this augments character. We gradually evolve into beings whose desire and habit is to do God's will. We gradually achieve that state where “It is my will that Your will be done”. ([UB 111:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_6))

Our capacity for discovering God's will, and our ability. to put our discovery into practice, thus gradually grow as our characters evolve. We gradually become characters who are capable of finding God as we increasingly cultivate behaviour and make decisions which are compatible with His creation. As we do so, the need to obtain specific guidance for particular decisions will diminish, and there will be progressively less need to run the risks associated with that procedure.

## Value For Money

When you buy something you pay for it. You exchange your measure of worth for someone else's measure of worth. You make your living by generating something of worth to others. The product you generate has its value set by the worth you give to it; you alone give it its value.

If you value your product, be it time or labour, at $70 and it takes you two hours for you to generate this product, then it's going to take you two hours of work for you to be able to enjoy the benefits of someone else's product if their product has been valued by them at $70. Accordingly it will take you ten hours of work for you to enjoy a product like a colour television which has been valued at four hundred dollars. When you buy a house which has been valued at $140,000 then you're going to have to contribute four thousand of your hours. This of course is a costing of net money, after all of your running expenses and taxes have been accounted for.

If you value your own product at $20, and it takes you the same two hours to produce it, obviously you are going to have to contribute a lot more hours of work before you can enjoy the same benefits.

Most people generate the value they set on their product by having other people establish its worth. They are quite content on the one hand to take the security of a job which pays them $10 for every hour, and yet on the other hand they feel restless deep down because they sense that they are settling for second best. They genuinely feel that their product is worth more than the ten dollars an hour they are being offered for it. They cannot budge the situation though because their reality does not support a value beyond the $10. If they want to seriously take steps to increase their value for their product, and hence their quality of life, they have to change their very value system itself.

Changing your value system is done authentically in two ways: you realize the value of your product from your spiritual dimensions of Truth and Value rather than from the denial and poverty consciousness of non-spiritual reality, from which any increase in value is merely greed unsubstantiated by your entire being and life itself. And secondly, if you evaluate your product from your authentic spiritual Truth your product is going to change so as to accord with the value you are now generating in life.

Life is about value. Life is a continuous flux of change. Progress is the evolution in value, regression is the degradation of the present values. By nature God is an expansion in value and we experience this in our own spiritual development as we move into larger and more universally realistic and acceptable standards of behaviour. The dollar is not real. It is a token of the value we each place upon our reality.

Someone with true poverty consciousness will have little value for the quality of life and for him value is wholly contained within the actual coin. Someone who lives in the spirit and knows their value system from their spiritually earned and supported self worth is of course far better equipped to support and upgrade the quality for everyone else. As s /he attains greater spiritually derived value and contributes that to others their own spiritually derived value also increases and is returned to him/her in cyclic motion, ever spiralling in an ascension of values. The value you place on life probably differs vastly from that placed on your life by your Guardian Angel ... because she has an enlarged view of your life and its meaning in the grand scheme of things. This enlarged view is available to each human as $s /$ he attains the reality which can live from real and enlarged views ... and that is a spiritual matter, a concern of your spirit.

If someone comes to you and wants to benefit from your product, and the value you place on it is $70 but the value your client has set himself is $20 for his product, the client will perhaps think that there is an inequality in this exchange. But this thinking is merely the result of their value system and evidences the actual integrity of their value system. The reality is that when you have authentically valued your product at $70 — because spiritually you have no choice — then this client is going to have his own life augmented as well as his value system. If he genuinely cannot afford to meet your value in money then have him contribute the balance of the value to others. If he can pay $20 then the balance for your product is $ 50 ... or 2 of his hours. Let him agree to contribute 2&frac12; hours to the happiness of others. This keeps the cycle of values in healthy circulation.

If in a week you generate 10 items of your product which net you your $700, consider contributing 108 of that to God. That means for every 10 items you market 1 of them is given away.

Who do you give it to? Your own value system will let you know that. It's more than likely that your own spiritual value will select someone who will benefit by the bestowal of such a value. There's a difference between giving away, in this instance, $70 to a poverty conscious person who cannot circulate its value in anything other than monetary form (they have a good meal or get drunk and the buck stops there with a good burp!) and a person who can use it to uplift their own value and in turn recycle that value back into life for the further upliftment and support of others. Just as the rich get richer, so too do the valuable get more valuable... and this is good because the invaluable could not possibly be responsible for life's values, the valuable.

The natural law of spirit is that what is given is received back in increased measure; a single acorn when planted returns a hundred acorns. As you increasingly agree with the will of God you will find that your self worth is vitally important to others. Likewise the value of your product is equally important to others. The coin in your pocket is entirely a secondary matter, it is only a token gesture of your actual worth. So, it is good and natural to give to God — to consciously return to spirit that which is from spirit in the conscious recognition that you are returning that which is of spirit ... value. Such practice is the direct expression of love ... outgoing and incoming.

“Baptism Of The Spirit” BY Robert Crickett

## New Issue Of “The Jesusonian”

As of April 29th, the Jesusonian Foundation has made available their latest issue. This publication individually has a specialness about it that transcends being just another issue of a series publication. It is unique, focused, balanced, and indispensable. If you attended the Maine 1987 Conference, you will remember the superb art work displaying the universe levels of ascension up to Paradise with special pictures of Havona and the superuniverse worlds. These artworks make this issue of 'The Jesusonian' an item which every URANTIA Book reader will want to have and share.

The issue is based on the ascension career and has an issue title about life after death. Descriptions of the many levels of the universe are discussed, photographically complemented and highlighted by the cosmic artwork making this issue an “introduction to cosmic afterlife”. It is so compellingly beautiful that your friends and relatives who know of the book slightly, well, or not at all will all be intrigued and attracted to this excellent work. Your examining the work yourself will make it clear to you why I cannot express its clarity and communicability. Subscribers will receive a copy automatically. Others may buy copies at US $3.95 each; $2.95 each for 25 copies; and $1.95 each for one hundred or more. The address is: Jesusonian Foundation, 620 12th Street, Boulder, CO 80302, USA.

## The Remarkable Amenhotep Iv

I was fortunate to be in Cairo, Egypt two years ago. My first day there I was faced with having to spend the morning in the Cairo Museum when all I really wanted to do was see the Great Pyramids at Giza and the Sphinx which guarded them. But I was stuck for what was to be five hours in a cluttered, barely organized warehouse containing the pride of 3000 years of Ancient Egypt. “This is obnoxious”, I thought. Do I really want to spend my precious time in this dreary hall?" And yet, if one wants to learn anything at all about that captivating historic period, they simply must go there. What a remarkable window to the distant past! Go clockwise and one begins to get a sense of chronology; maybe someone didn't just throw all this stuff in here. Over there is a remarkable display of artifacts and statuary from the time of those pyramid builders Zoser, Chephren, and Mykerinos. They were the big boys a very long time ago when lower Egypt ruled the Nile. Keep on going and one will detect the power base of Egypt shifting to the south (or to Upper Egypt as the flow of the Nile is reckoned). It was in this middle period that Egypt reached perhaps the greatest of her several golden ages; when the temples of Luxor and Karnak grew in size and significance and pharaohs were laid to rest in the Valley of the Kings.

In this room here — the remnants of the age of Thutmoses, who presided over an age of vast territorial expansion. This comer is devoted to Queen Hathepsut. How was she so clever to attain the hall of power? I was getting excited now. I thought, “Boy, I can't wait to get past pharaohs Amenhotep 1 through 4 because then there's Ramses, the great builder of monuments. After that it's upstairs to see the complete Tutankhamun. I'll bet there's more gold there than in all of Fort Knox!”

Thank God for Mohammed, my guide, who tactfully ushered me into a relatively small room and began to explain what I was looking at, “This room is dedicated to Amenhotep IV”, he explained, “who temporarily changed the face of Egypt. He moved the capital city from Karnak to Tel El Amarna and proceeded to proclaim the Aton, the sun god, as the creator and sustainer of all. Notice the very liberalized art styles and how every time Amenhotep is depicted, it's in worshipful praise towards the Aton. All the other pharaohs were somehow themselves blessed, or sanctioned, by deity.”

The man was a rebel, a delightful, humble rebel. I could not help but be attracted to him. His queen was the famous Nefertiti. Who wouldn't want to be married to her?

As Einstein suggested, great men have always been besieged by Lilliputian minds. Mohammed went on to say that upon Amenhotep's death conservative forces allied against him destroyed his city and most of what it contained, The capital returned to Karnak, the powerful priests rejected Aton for the more familiar Amun and his pantheon of animistic deity buddies.

“Oh, by the way, this man was so committed to the worship of Aton that he changed his name from Amenhotep IV to Ikhnaton.”

Ikhnaton! That's the guy in _The URANTIA Book_! They talk about this religious giant of his age and I just saw the proof here in Room 27 !

Indeed. _The URANTIA Book_ states that “never in all history did any king so methodically proceed to swing a whole nation from polytheism to monotheism as did this extraordinary Ikhnaton.” ([UB 95:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/95#p5_4)) The Melchizedek author goes on to say that had he been more politically savvy, Ikhnaton may have founded a great monotheistic tradition in Egypt that possibly could have culminated in Michael's seventh bestowal taking place there. Oh well.

There are two basic approaches to our understanding of _The URANTIA Book_ which, for the purpose of making this essay work, I'll call faith and fact.

Faith, I suppose, can originate as a sort of wishful thinking. “I think that might be true, at least I hope it is.” However, faith evolved is knowing. There is so much of the book that speaks to the heart, no less than to the spirit within. It's as if the truth, borne by the celestial authors, meets that growing divinity of spirit within us. They fuse. We intuit, we somehow know that it's true. Which of us has not been thrilled by a passage such as this: “There is in the mind of God a plan which embraces every creature of all his vast domains, and this plan is an eternal purpose of boundless-opportunity, unlimited progress and endless life. And the infinite treasures of such a matchless career are yours for the striving. The goal of eternity is ahead! The adventure of divinity attainment lies before you! The race for perfection is on! Whosoever will may enter, and certain victory will crown the efforts of every human being who will run the race of faith and trust...” ([UB 32:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p5_8)) Do we have proof of this? No. But many of us have faith-absorbed it and faith-grasped it.

On the other hand, _The URANTIA Book_ is loaded with facts. We are, not to our discredit, creatures of time and space and we are mightily influenced by the logical, rational approach. “Prove it to me”, we say, “and if it meets these criteria, I'll accept it as true.” That's all right, Is not the universe predicated on the inevitable link between cause and effect?

Wouldn't we love if on the six o'clock news Dan Rather said: “Scientists today discovered what they believe to be basic units of materialized energy more fundamental than even the atom or its components”? We'd revel, “Ah, they've found the -! Just like it says in _The URANTIA Book_.”

Wouldn't we rejoice if the Voyager spacecraft, now pulling outwards toward Neptune and Pluto, radioed back irrefutable evidence of our solar system's eleventh and twelfth planets? Our confidence in the book would be strengthened. Indeed, this process of verification of what we've already been told is an ongoing one and is quickening.

The restatement of the teachings of Jesus is made easier by the presence of the Biblical account. He was here a mere 2,000 years ago and we do have records that have survived. We, therefore, have a factual foundation upon which to build newer and grander interpretations.

For the story of Adam and Eve, now 40,000 years past, we have considerably less to go on. A garbled allegory in Genesis is all. We have virtually nothing concrete upon which to place the book's elaborate story of celestial beings coming to earth, biological upliftment and a design for planetary education.

Who can say what our science and discovery will prove to be true in the decades to come? I know I'I1 never forget that moment in the wonderfully cluttered Cairo Museum when I learned that Ikhnaton was actually and indeed the great religious reformer _The URANTIA Book_ says he was. There, the ongoing verification and correlation of human knowledge with divine revelation continued apace. I felt wonderful. I realized that the validation of fact is one building block towards construction of a greater faith.

In Ancient Egypt, long before Ikhnaton, there was another great teacher named Amenope. He was the actual author of the First Psalm of the Bible which Ikhnaton embraced. It reads in part:

“Blessed is the man...
whose delight is in the law of
the Lord.
He is like a tree
planted by streams of water
that yields its fruit in its season...”

Blessed is the remarkable Amenhotep IV, now thirty centuries gone, who, like a tree planted by streams of water, still yields his spiritual fruit for all seasons.

## World Becoming Better 

by Jack Cahill — Toronto Star

In these times of superpower, militarism and nuclear arms, of Gulf Wars and Middle East tensions, Third World poverty and debt, terrorism and hostage takings, it might surprise a lot of people to learn that the world is gradually becoming a better place in some important ways.

Consider, for instance:

* Since 1950 child death rates have been halved in almost every region of the developing world.
* In the same period the average human lifespan has increased by more than 30 per cent ( 46 years to 61 years) and most of that increase has happened in the poorer parts of the Third World.
* Also since 1950 the proportion of the world's adults who can read and write has risen from 55 per cent to 72 per cent. * Since 1946 the percentage of the developing world's 6-to11 -year olds who at least start school has risen from just over 50 per cent to almost 95 per cent. And the.proportion going on to secondary school is up from about 10 per cent to about 40 per cent.
* The population explosion is being defused as birth rates have begun to fall steeply in every region of the world except sub-Saharan Africa.
* While the world's population has doubled in the past 40 years, food production has trebled, so that at least threequarters of the world's people are now reasonably well fed. * Between 1970 and 1986, the percentage of the world's population with safe water supply has gone up from 65 per cent to 86 per cent in towns and cities and from 13 to 44 per cent in the countryside.

All this and more has occurred despite the gloomy facts of stagnating trade, failing commodity prices, declining aid, mounting debt repayments, and a steep decline in private lending that have stalled economic development in many countries during this decade.

Between 1980 and 1985, average incomes fell in 17 out of 23 countries in Latin America and in 24 out of 32 countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Overall average incomes fell by 9 per cent in Latin America and by 15 per cent in Africa. Only the more dynamic economies of Southeast Asia and the larger, more insulated nations such as India and China have managed to sustain significant economic progress.

The main reason for this is a combination of two factors the communications revolution that allows for quick transmission of knowledge and the much improved educational standards that allow people to absorb the knowledge and to understand and use it.

TWO FACTORS

Still, the statistics from UNICEF show that quality of life, on a worldwide basis, has continued to improve dramatically despite all the economic doom and gloam.

## From Our Mail Bag

To Ken Glasziou:

I do not think the U-Book gave us any false information. Many times they said they didn't know or had been forbidden to reveal certain things to us — but to tell us outright lies? NO. If something doesn't go along with what the scientists now think, it's because the scientists have made mistakes they often do, you know.

To William Wentworth:

About the only form of group worship I enjoy is singing. Jesus was very averse to praying in public (1620). I enjoy group study very much, but that isn't worship. Anyway I never could pray in public. I didn't feel as if I were talking to God. I felt as if I were talking to the people around me.
