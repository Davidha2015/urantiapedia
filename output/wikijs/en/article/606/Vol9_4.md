## A note from the 6-0-6 Team

With our South Pacific Regional Meeting of URANTIA Book Readers less than three months away, Kathleen Swadling reports that 54 people have registered so far, but that further registrations can still be accepted.

The Scientific Symposium in Nashville, Tennessee was a resounding success. You can read Ken and Betty Glasziou's report in this issue of 6-0-6. We also bring you the second part of Ken's paper “Two Remarkable Predictions”. This one is on “Continental Drift”.

Since our last Newsletter we have had the pleasure of meeting with two more URANIIA Book readers from overseas.

Dexter Cave from Tahiti, who was on a working tour around Victoria and New South Wales had a chance to meet study group members in Melbourne and Sydney. We spent a pleasant and stimulating evening together and Dexter hopes that he and his family will be able to attend our South Pacific Meeting in October.

Dana Poole from Griffin, Georgia, U.S. is the editor of the newsletter ‘Harmony’, which is published only once a year. Dana who is a professor of children's literature, attended the world conference on children's literature in Surfers Paradise near Brisbane. She was able to combine her work with meeting some URANTIA Book readers in Brisbane, Towamba, Melbourne and Sydney. One of her great delights was visiting the Healesville Sanctuary near Melbourne where she could take snapshots of our native fauna and flora to her heart's content. We also showed her a virgin rain forest on Mount Donna Buang near Warburton, where some of the Myrtle beeches are believed to be about one thousand years old and play host to numerous ferns and mosses. With the crystal clear water of Cement Creek running between the fern trees and giant Mountain Ash, the tallest hardwood in the world, it is a beautiful place indeed and Dana had never seen anything like it in her life. We hope she will be able to return to Australia one day to renew the friendships she has made during her short sojourn in this beautiful country of ours.

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “The hope of modern Christianity is that it should cease to sponsor the social systems and industrial policies of Western civilization while it humbly bows itself before the cross it so valiantly extols, there to learn anew from Jesus of Nazareth the greatest truths mortal man can ever hear — the living gospel of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man.” [UB 195:10.21](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_21)

## The Second Remarkable Prediction

CONTINENTAL DRIFT: _The URANTIA Book_ states quite categorically. that all land on earth was originally a single continent that subsequently broke up, commencing 750 million years ago ([UB 57:8.23](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p8_23)), followed by a long period of continental drifting during which land bridges were repeatedly. formed and broken.

The idea of continental drift was mooted in the 19th century and first put forward as a comprehensive theory by Wegener in 1912. It was not well accepted, being classified with gee-whiz science, and becoming more and more discredited until the 1960s. I can still remember attending a geology lecture at Sydney University in 1951 when the lecturer dismissed the concept of continental drift with the comment that there were no known forces that could wrench continents apart. The change in attitude was initiated by the discovery of long mountain ranges on the ocean floors, such as the Mid-Atlantic Ridge that stretches from Iceland to Antartica. During the 1960 's, careful examination of the ocean floor revealed that the rock from the Earth's mantle is being melted, then forced upwards resulting in sea floor spreading. This upwelling would be expected to push the continents apart, and thus provided the missing evidence for physical mechanism that could bring about continental drift. However, it was not called continental drift, and instead was given the more scientific name of plate tectonics.

The URANTIA Papers that mention continental drift were presented in 1934, and published in _The URANTIA Book_ in 1955. In the 1950's, continental drift theory was widely ridiculed. The writers of The URANTIA Papers could not have been unaware of the very tenuous nature of the theory of continental drift, and unless they had access to pre-existing knowledge, would appear to be doing a foolish thing in going against virtually all established scientific opinion.

_The URANTIA Book_ is at variance with many published estimates of geological time, for instance for the Carboniferous and Devonian periods where the discrepancy may be about 100,000,000 years. In some areas there is good agreement, for example _The URANTIA Book_ p. 683 talks of the disappearance of the land bridges between the Americas and Europe and Africa in the era between 160 and 170 million years ago, and an article in Scientific American, June 1979 places this break at 165 million years. However, land bridges connected these continents again at later times via Greenland, Iceland and the Behring Straits, and also connected South America to Australia via Antartica, and directly to Africa ([UB 61:1.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p1_12), [UB 61:2.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p2_3), [UB 61:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_4), [UB 61:3.8-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p3_8), [UB 61:4.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/61#p4_6), and Scientific American (January) 1983 p. 60)

A most remarkable aspect of _The URANTIA Book_ accounts is the statement that the breakup of the supercontinent commenced 750 million years ago. Wegener placed it at 200 million years ago. The 1984 edition of Encyclopedia Brittanica's Science and Technology presented what purported to be an up to date series of maps depicting the progress of continental drift from 50 to about 200 million years ago which is at variance with a similar portrayal in Scientific American (1984) 250:41 by about 100,000,000 years in aspects of the progression. However, both versions still placed the commencement of continental drift in the vicinity of 200 to 250 million years ago. A little earlier, in Richard Leakey's book “The Making of Mankind” published in 1981 p.32 we read “Two hundred million years ago, all the continents were in contact, forming a single super continent known as Pangea”. However; somewhere about 1980 some geologists were having different thoughts. In John Gribben's book “Genesis”, published in 1982 we read that there was a pre-existing continent, Pangea I, roughly 600 million years ago that broke up into four new continents by about 450 million years ago, at the end of the Ordovician. Then about 200 million years ago, the continents converged to form Pangea II, which quickly broke, first to Laurasia and Gondwanaland, then further breakup occurred giving an appearance much like the present world at the end of the Cretaceous. In an article in Scientific American (1984) 250(2), p.41 it is stated that major preexisting continents broke up in late Ripherian times between 700 and 900 million years ago, and in a 1987 article (Sc.Am April 256,84) the breakup of Pangea I is placed somewhere near the beginning of the pre-Cambrian, in the order of 600 million years ago.

So, 30 years after publication of _The URANTIA Book_, not only has a discredited theory become accepted by virtually all geologists, but even the date of commencement of breakup of the super continent that for many, many years was assumed to have started only 200 million years ago, has, by virtue of new information coming to hand only in the 1980 's now been pushed back to beyond the pre-Cambrian era, and close to the 750 million years ago as stated in the URANTIA Papers in 1934.

It is quite impossible to calculate the odds against being right about such a matter 50 or even 30 years ago. Perhaps one chance in a million would be an underestimate. But considering both the predictions regarding neutrinos, the W$ particle, the undiscovered strong force, and neutron stars together, with this remarkable statement on both the time of commencement of continental drift and the factuality of its existence, it is exceedingly difficult to make any other conclusion but than that the authors had access to pre-existing knowledge, at least in respect to these subjects. Taking into account everything that had been written about them by 1934 , or even by 1955 , there is virtually no chance of guessing correctly the predictions found in the URANTIA Papers. This conclusion holds no matter how much error may be thought to exist in respect to other statements of a scientific nature to be found in the Book.

## Baptism Of The Spirit

It's May 201988 and the phone rings. The caller pleads for an immediate consultation. Presently I have before me a young woman who is steeped in the beliefs of magic and the occult. She is suffering throat constriction and severe chest pains. Her opening comments are of her chronic fear once again being projected onto her new-found lover, a fear that he will leave her ... the very same fear which led her to behave in such a way as to prompt the rapid departure of her last lover.

During the course of our counselling session she tells me of an overwhelming hatred for her European and presumably migrant parents. This hatred extends with equal vehemence toward herself. She abuses her body, her emotions and her thinking by lustingly despising their very existence. She knows no satisfaction in any quarter of her life save the faint hope that one day she will master her sorcery and somehow be with God. She hates her job, a menial factory position. She has few friends outside of the odd occultist. She tried reading the Bible but couldn't make any sense out of it. She likewise tried reading _The URANTIA Book_ and made even less sense out of it. The fruit of many years of devoted self-tutored research into magic as her quest for God and the benefits of spiritual salvation have little to show for all of her effort. She has a fascination and an obsession with trance states, communicating with non-humans and the dead, conjuring up energies and powers who will be allies to her in her quest for the superhuman, the sexually satisfying, and the powerful. She is racked by a heart-breaking loneliness and separation from God and from people, even from like-minded people who equally research life's value in sorcery and magic. Here before me is a woman not unlike many people these days, desperate for help with her physical condition but also her spiritual condition.

My therapeutic approach to helping her condition is grounded in the reality Jesus speaks of:

> “He who lives in me, and I in him, will bear much fruit of the spirit and experience the supreme joy of yielding this spiritual harvest. If you will maintain this living spiritual connection with me, you will bear abundant fruit. If you abide in me and my words live in you, you will be able to commune freely with me, and then can my living spirit so infuse you that you may ask whatsoever my spirit wills and do all this with the assurance that the Father will grant us our petition.” ([UB 180:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p2_1))

What this means to me in experiential terms is that whenever I am acting in a helping role I draw on being one with the Father and one with the Son. Out of this joint will emerges the necessary therapeutic approach, both the questioning process and the change-making process. Such a position seems always to be the most expedient and most ecological means by which an appropriate measure of assistance can be rendered: ecological that is, to both the person in need as well as myself and then to both of us in the light of the ecology of God the Supreme — the will of God as it is expressed on that particular occasion.

Seeing as she is so good at summoning allies I have her create two people, both finalized in their quest for God. One has travelled the sorcerer's path such as she is doing, the other has no traceable path and is wholly pure in so much as no other resource is called on in life except the presence of God and the joint fused will of God/Man. I get her to derive help from each of these two imagined personalities as they answer in her mind those questions which I pose audibly. Accordingly she receives responses from them suggesting that she should trust more, love more, drop her magic practice and seek God directly. As a result of this dialogue with, to her, real beings who have attained those goals she quests after, she is brought to the realization that her approach to spirituality needs revamping. No one is able to receive help unless they can recognize that their present approach is lacking in some way. Her whole understanding is now prepared to receive whatever changes can satisfactorily be built upon that which is of real and spiritual value in her: “Every branch which comes out of me which bears no fruit, the Father will take away. Every branch which bears fruit, the Father will cleanse that it may bear more fruit.” ([UB 180:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p2_1))

As I begin to intervene so as to bring about harmonizing solutions in her life I am reminded that, “Prayer is designed to make man less thinking but more realizing; it is not designed to increase knowledge but rather to expand insight.” ([UB 143:7.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/143#p7_4)) Her perspective on her family, herself, her job etc. is in such a way as to create in her a soul-consuming hatred. If her perspective on these matters can be enlarged, and be enlarged by God, then perhaps she won't have the hatred and so be better equipped to derive nourishment from them than be contaminated and crushed by them. I ask her to call upon THAT which is most spiritual for her, and to ask IT to give her a prayer that she could speak INTO the uncomfortable situation she has in her mind concerning her parents.

She waits a while and then replies: “There's something coming but it's in a language I don't understand.” This is common to her. In her trances she meets with beings who speak in incomprehensible languages ... and to date this has been to her an indication of spiritual success and progress. I ask her to call upon a translator to interpret for her. Shortly she says: “Father, Son, and Holy Spirit ... with Jesus ... have mercy on me.” I ask her to now direct that prayer into an imagined scene from her relationship with her parents ... a scene which portrays all of the discomfort and hatred she feels at its most intense. She does this and after a while she opens her eyes. I ask her: “How is the situation with your parents now?” She looks more relaxed physically and in a mildly bewildered state says: “It's quite calm ... there's a settledness about it.” I then get her to repeat the prayer with her job situation, but the prayer doesn't change anything. I ask her to call on THAT which is most spiritual for her and again ask it for a suitable prayer. She does this and after a while says: “Mother Mary ... full of grace ... have mercy on me.” And upon reopening her eyes she tells me that the job situation has developed the same calm and easiness about it.

Then she closes her eyes and enters into a deep trance state which has her head wildly flailing around. Her arms move irratically and her body twitches involuntarily. She has entered what for her is her deepest and most hope-filled state ... the state which she hopes will deliver into her life those spiritual gifts she has heard about, and that spiritual union with God she craves in her deepest recesses. I watch and I am reminded of the words of the Chief of Urantia Midwayers: “Mysticism, as the technique of the cultivation of the consciousness of the presence of God, is altogether praiseworthy, but when such practices lead to social isolation and culminate in religious fanaticism, they are all but reprehensible. Altogether too frequently that which the overwrought mystic evaluates as divine inspiration is the uprisings of his own deep mind.” ([UB 91:7.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p7_1))

I am also reminded of the words of a Melchizedek of Nebadon who says timelessly: “The characteristics of the mystical state are diffusion of consciousness with vivid islands of focal attention operating on a comparatively passive intelect. All of this gravitates consciousness toward the subconscious rather than in the direction of the zone of spiritual contact, the superconscious. Many mystics have carried their mental dissociation to the level of abnormal manifestations ... The direct communion with one's Thought Adjuster, such as occurred in the later years of Jesus' life in the flesh, should not be confused with these so-called mystical experiences.” ([UB 100:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p5_9))

It is in the light of the above concepts that I understand this woman's extraordinary behaviour, how she has come to have so very much spiritual value invested in the manifestation of this kind of trance state, evidence of her belonging to God and of God's hand in her life. Within this frustrated display I perceive the call of her Adjuster, the whisper of the Spirit of Truth, and I see their efforts being perverted and stifled by the giving of herself over to passivity in the understanding that if she subjugates herself sufficiently into this meditative trance state, God will be able to act in her... as a puppeteer has total will over the puppet. She needs the powerful knowledge: “...the creature personality consents chooses — to subject the creature will to the Father's will.” “Such a creature choice is not surrender of will. It is a consecration of will, an expansion of will, a glorification of will, a perfecting of will ... the personality of the creature son communes with the personality of the spirit Father.” ([UB 111:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p5_4))

By endorsing such passivism in herself she is in fact defeating her own purpose and efforts as she seeks union with God. In the words of the Solitary Messenger of Orvonton: “If you so fully conform to the adjuster's mind that you see eye to eye, then your minds become one, and you receive the reinforcement of the Adjuster's mind. Subsequently, if your will orders and enforces the execution of decisions of this new or combined mind, the Adjuster's pre-personal will attains to personality expression through your decision, and as far as that particular project is concerned, you and the Adjuster are one.” ([UB 110:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_5))

I recognize something in her behaviour which she could well do without in her approach to both God and her daily life; a passive will when she approaches spiritual matters... despite the same will being dynamically hate-inspired whenever she approaches other and less escape-proof daily life matters. There comes with this recognition the inspiration to act in faith as Jesus acted in faith. I 'knew' I needed to 'cast out' this mannerism of hers. It is hardly an exorcism, hardly a matter of possession by evil spirits who need casting out of this young woman's body. It is appropriate to exercise in faith the command that this behaviour will cease, nothing more complex or intriguing than that. Suddenly I find myself saying to her: “This state of mind is false ... it will not lead you to God ... it is not of God ... I command it to cease now ... nevermore to be found in you.” About five or ten seconds later she is coming around. She is stable in her senses. She is relaxed and poised. Something has changed in her... in the way we see a fever has left someone.

I am just as surprised as she is that this has come about! How delicious it is to experience first hand the truth our Midwayer neighbours write about: “It is entirely true that, when your will has been truly aligned with his, you can ask anything conceived by that will-union, and it will be granted. And such a will-union is effected by and through Jesus even as the life of the vine flows into and through the living branches.” ([UB 180:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p2_4))

To all intents and purposes now she is a woman who, when she approaches God in worshipful union and when she is led by the Spirit of Truth, will be more receptive to the direct impressions of her indwelling divinity, and less susceptible to translate them in terms that cause her disaster.

I now see in this woman a certain stability of mind; yet clearly there is lack of spiritual integrity and sound knowledge she can call on after she walks out of my door. It is as if she needs to be spiritualized in some way, so that she is equipped with a dynamic and living goodness as her life's foundation rather than having undirected desire — which in the past has led to her intense hatred — as her foundation. Suddenly, as soon as I think like this, she bursts out the words: “I've never been baptized!”

And I have never baptized anyone before. I know how the priests do it in the Anglican church. I have seen John the Baptist look-alikes do it in the movies. I flip through a dozen questions in my mind in a split second: shall I be the one to baptize her? Those people who baptize people into the Kingdom of Heaven, after Jesus, act for the Father and the Son ... am I responsible enough to so act, on their behalf? What shall I baptize her into? Jesus the Saviour, as conceived over the past 1988 years, is not real enough for me ... Jesus of _The URANTIA Book_ may not even deem the physical act of baptism to play much of a role in one's entry into the Kingdom ... with what words shall I anoint her on behalf of the Father and in the spirit of the Son? ... Oh how the questions and doubts roll off my mind.'s tongue! Within another split second I am realizing that my side of the story has next to nothing to do with this woman's need, nor with the Father's poised will. I baptize her.

I fill a small rice bowl with water and I cone to her where she sits. I am a complete novice. I have no idea what I am about to do. I only know that this is the will of my Father and we three, my Father, the young woman and myself, are involved in the eternal spiritual invitation ... baptism of the spirit ... and as this ritual begins we three have absolute certainty toward it. Getting it 'right' is of little importance, doing it is paramount.

I briefly speak to her about how baptism is her volunteering to enter into a spiritual life with Jesus, living in him as he lives in her. I say that within her dwells the spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Truth, and also the spirit of the Father, her Thought Adjuster, and that these two accompany her in her spiritual growth and eternal destiny. I dip my finger into the water and making a cross sign on her forehead I tell her: “I baptise you in the presence of God the Father.” I again dip my finger and make another cross sign on her forehead saying: “I baptise you in the presence of God the Son.” I dip my finger a third time and make a third cross sign on her forehead saying: “I baptise you in the presence of God the Holy Spirit ... all this in the presence of Jesus.” I then place my hand on the top of her head for a few seconds and then empty the remaining water from the rice bow1 into the sink. It is done.

This young woman has been baptized. She sits quietly, absorbed in her own deliberations. I feel further moved to act out the will of my Father and I divide some bread and fill a cup with wine. Now again, close by her side, I tell her of _The URANTIA Book_'s meaning of the remembrance supper: “As often as you do this ... recall that I once was with you ... take this bread ... and eat it ... I an the bread of life ... take this cup ... and drink of it ... the emblem of the bestowal and ministry of the divine Spirit of Truth ... when you become thus spirit-conscious, the Son is actually present, and his spirit fraternizes with the indwelling fragment of his Father.” ([UB 179:5.6-9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_6)) And we both partake of this bread and wine. Then I put away the wine and gather the crumbs for the birds.

I return to my seat opposite her. She has been weeping and is visibly moved. She looks at me saying: “I don't need to keep my ugliness! My ugliness has gone!” She feels for her pain and tells me: “My throat is well ... and my chest has no pain.”

Through the baptism she is healed, she is made whole, she is restored and h:s returned to her unspoiled self — and only the unspoiled self does the will of God, only the unspoiled is capable of knowing the absolute unspoiled, the Father. “Even so, the child of God comes into grace and the new life of the spirit by the will of the Father in heaven. Therefore must the kingdom of heaven — divine sonship — be received as by a little child. You earn righteousness — progressive character development — but you rẹceive sonship by grace and through faith.” ([UB 144:4.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/144#p4_3)) Through the baptism she receives the kingdom of heaven. Through the baptism she has thrown off the shackles of her beliefs and orphanhood which kept her separate from God by their design of a path to God ... she ever trod the path but the baptism plunged her directly and immediately into the very presence of the Father and the Son; the path, any path, is made redundant in the baptism of the spirit.

I spend some time sharing her joy ... joy I suspect she's never known before. The joy of the spirit. The joy which arises independent of all the stimulus the world can provide. I mention to her the benefits of continued fellowship with other URANTIA Book readers who are equally bathed in the spirit, and of the presence of study groups in Melbourne. At length, obviously a changed woman, a woman God has revolutionized to her foundations, she leaves and goes home. I am left pondering, as it has concerned the both of us, “... and as far as that particular project is concerned, you and the Adjuster are one. Your mind has attained to divinity attunement, and the Adjuster's will has achieved personality expression.” ([UB 110:2.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p2_5))

The day goes on and I am numbed. I cannot think rationally about what has occurred in this baptism. I had always thought baptism with water and in ritual to be an orthodox Church thing. It somehow had never sat comfortably in me to associate it with the possible spiritual movement one experiences with _The URANTIA Book_ teachings. I had always associated baptism with acceptance of Jesus as one's saviour, as Christianity depicts his role in our lives. I have experienced the conversion in terms of Jesus being my saviour, in Pentecostal church terms, in “born again” terms, and after a flood of biblical truths pervaded every cell of my body ... as if the Spirit of Truth had been unleashed and was confirming every detail from Genesis to Revelation as being literally true ... I reflected upon the greater reality I have come to know through _The URANTIA Book_. The two stood in conflict. On the one hand there was an extraordinary vitality and overwhelming physical compulsion to evangelize the world in terms of Biblical fundamentalism, and on the other hand there was the liberation of the kingdom as revealed in _The URANTIA Book_, a liberation from the evolved and traditional, the dogmatic and the fear-driven. The latter was without the “go-for-it” of the former, yet I chose the latter ... trusting that somehow I would grow to be able to pull down into my reality the new up to date version of Michael's sonship charisma. Joy in Christ is love amplified a million-fold. I am now recognizing through this baptism experience that this new charisma is making itself real on the planet in URANTIA Book terms. And that's fabulous!

I have an overwhelming need to share the day's events with the group of readers' meeting tonight, to discuss it, to saviour it, to explore the possibility of it being a taste of greater things to came. The group seem equally enthused and inspired. We drink deeply from Paper 194:2 “The Significance of Pentecost” ([UB 194:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_1)) with all the enthusiasm of the apostles on that great day of the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth. I taste the sweetness of fellowship in this spirit with the readers and oh how wonderful and satisfying it is to be in a group now moved from the intellectuality of study and discussion ... “the Son is actually present.” ([UB 179:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/179#p5_6))

We bring to light the fact that sharing _The URANTIA Book_ with newcomers has been a little onesided. Just as the apostles had introduced newcomers to Jesus and they in turn founded a religion about him, we introduce newcomers to _The URANTIA Book_ ... but God knows we desperately look for alternatives to setting up a religion about it! Now it seems more appropriate to introduce newcomers in a living way to the living spirit, living sonship, the living kingdom — and _The URANTIA Book_ is merely this spiritual banquet's menu. Today's baptism evidenced tremendous Father and Son reinforcement, will, design and purpose ... deeply affecting both the young woman who received the grace, and myself who had the grace given opportunity to act in faith in this way. Perhaps more readers will find themselves in the position of baptizing newcomers as time goes on. Perhaps it's God's will being realized here on Urantia now, that the act of receiving sonship and daughtership can be facilitated not so much by struggling page after page through _The URANTIA Book_, a process which for us who survived it revealed itself to be the necessary spiritualization and upliftment in our thinking such that we could receive the kingdom — necessary because, just like the apostles were the first of their line, we are the trail blazers of this new revelation and spiritual reality for future generations of believers — but rather by drawing directly on the Spirit of the book and transmitting this spirit via a baptism to newcomers. Then, when the newcomer is baptized by the spirit, s /he receives the means to embody the teachings, and receives the spirit within the Son's fellowship gravity which unites and attracts believers together. Then the newcomer finds in the reader, the baptizer, the vehicle for God's grace bestowal which returns the person to their unspoiled self; and the unspoiled self is the alpha and omega of _The URANTIA Book_ and practical spiritual life.

The Paper we drink so richly from tells us about this spirit and its role in our sonship: “The term 'baptism of the spirit' ... merely signified the conscious reception of this gift of the Spirit of Truth and the personal acknowledgement of this new spiritual power as an augmentation of all spiritual influences previously experienced by God-knowing souls ... The first mission of this spirit is ... to foster and personalize truth ... to destroy the believer's feeling of orphanhood ... The spirit ... creates a consciousness of Michael, the Son ... your fellowship with the Spirit of Truth ... is found in your experiences of enhanced fellowship with Michael ... The spirit helps men to recall and understand the words of the Master ... to illuminate and reinterpret his life on earth ... to help the believer to witness the realities of Jesus' teachings and his life ... as he now again lives it anew ... in the individual believer... In less than a month after the bestowal of the Spirit of Truth, the apostles made more individual spiritual progress than during their almost four years of personal and loving association with the Master ... the gospel of the kingdom... truths of the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of men will emerge to effectually transform the civilization of all mankind.” ([UB 194:2.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/194#p2_8))

Today this young woman experienced all of this. What an introduction to the kingdom! “The call to the adventure of building a new and transformed human society by means of the spiritual rebirth of Jesus' brotherhood of the kingdom should thrill all who believe in him as men have not been stirred since the days when they walked about on earth as his companions in the flesh.” ([UB 195:10.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_6)) “Religion does need new leaders, spiritual men and women who will dare to depend solely on Jesus and his incomparable teachings.” ([UB 195:9.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p9_4)) “ ... dare to espouse the Master's program, thousands of apparently indifferent youths would rush forward to enlist in such a spiritual undertaking, and they would not hesitate to go all the way through with this great adventure.” ([UB 195:10.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_10)) “Jesus founded the religion of personal experience in doing the will of God and serving the human brotherhood.” ([UB 196:2.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p2_6)) “Christianity has indeed done a great service for this world, but what is now needed most is Jesus. The world needs to see Jesus living again on earth in the experience of spirit-born mortals who effectively reveal the Master to all men.” ([UB 195:10.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/195#p10_1))

Jesus IS the Spirit of Truth. Jesus IS the baptism of the Spirit. How often we merely pass _The URANTIA Book_ on to newcomers hungry for such dynamic spirituality as is Jesus. How easily we fob off _The URANTIA Book_ as an intellectual study, and an alternative to Christianity, and in doing so pass up the Father's grace-gift experience of participating in His baptism with the newcomer. Father make us your spiritual harvesters, not merely librarians. “ ... believe me for the sake of the very life I have lived — for the work's sake.” ([UB 180:3.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p3_9))

Perhaps the Father might say of this: “Lay down your reservations. Move among the people. With the spirit of one who preserves goodness and truth and beauty, bring before me those I choose. Let them voice their earnest desire to enter the fellowship of believers. Do not be hasty for I am still slow to show the fullness of the new pedigree. And, making a sign of the spirit, baptize their will into a new covenant with me.”

## Report On Scientific Symposium

The first Scientific Symposium for students of _The URANTIA Book_ held at Nashville, Tennessee May 1988, was attended by approximately 200 people and was a resounding success, hence is likely to be the first of many. Contrary to what I expected, few of the papers were directed towards discussion of points of contention between current scientific thought and scientific statements in _The URANTIA Book_. This was probably due to the fact that most of those attending were long time and convinced readers of the Book, most belonged to long established study groups, many knew one another, and presentations were more in the nature of scientific education and discussion. The papers presented are to be published shortly, I think copies are to be sent to those who attended, but regardless, George Samis from the Brotherhood of Man Library will be sending us a copy on disk so 6-0-6 is assured of getting the papers.

More along the lines I had anticipated, Matt Neibaur presented a paper in which he had selected from _The URANTIA Book_ on the life of Jesus, 8 different dates to which a definite day of the week can be assigned. Matt explained how, over the centuries, our calendars had been adjusted and modified up to the time when the Gregorian calendar was introduced at which date the calendar was months out of phase with the actual seasons of the year. Because of the mucking about with the calendar that had taken place, it seems that it requires a good computer program or else years of work to get your days and dates right for the period of Jesus' ministry. Matt's computer showed that The URANIIA Book has got the date and the day of the week right for all of the 8 occasions that he investigated.

As to the Conference itself, Betty and I benefited immensely by making personal contact with many people who have previously been only names, and of course many who were previously completely unknown to us. The friendliness and hospitality shown us was marvellous. After the Conference, George and Sharon Samis (Brotherhood of Man Library) took us in hand and organized us to set up an Australian branch of the Library. These people are doing an incredible amount of voluntary unpaid work and shortly will be sending us on computer disks, all the material presently in the U.S, branch of the Library.

It would be helpful to know about any 6-0-6 readers who have personal computers and modems. Software for a Bulletin Board is being provided to us so that individuals and study groups can swap greetings and messages, as well as to receive and contribute material to and from the Library. The 6-0.6 Newsletter is, of course, already included in the Library, and 6-0-6 will have a list of, and access to, all Library material. Please note that although the Commodore 64 is the recommended P.C., most other P.C.'s are successfully accessing the Library in the U.S.

George and Sharon eventually sent us on our way, after persuading me to buy a new disk drive for library use, and put us in a hire car arranged by Lee Rector, then we drove across Tennessee and North Carolina to stay with Phil and Jane Rolnick who are known to quite a few 6-0-6 readers as they were once teaching in Australia. Phil is presently a Ph.D. student in Theology at the fabulous Duke University, and, happily, Phil and I are attempting to combine our respective talents to do some writing together.

All in all we had a wonderful 2 weeks in the U.S.A. with fellow Urantians, and maybe will be going back in November to get some coaching from George Samis, Richard Preiss, and Tim Young on computerology and librarianship.

## Computer Analysis Of Dates In _The Urantia Book_

In 1572 a former professor of law from Bologna named Ugo Buoncompagni became Pope Gregory XIII; ten years later the Gregorian calendar was introduced. The Julian calendar, founded sixteen centuries earlier by Julius Caesar, was inaccurate and the need for reform was widely recognized. Its principal failure was the discrepancy between the mean length of its year, 365.25 days, and the tropical year, then averaging 365.24232 days. This is nearly eleven minutes and four seconds shorter than the Julian year. This small discrepancy had continued to accumulate until it was no longer a matter of minutes but days. By the time of the Gregorian reform, this error had grown to eleven days. Understandably, this was of concern to the Pope; if the calendar had continued unchanged, Easter would eventually have been celebrated in the summer.

The attempts at reform set off a wide range of debates, both academic and religious. At one point excommunication was threatened by the Pope against anyone who refused to accept the new calendar. The details and controversies created by the reform are presented beautifully in an article in the May 1982 issue of Scientific American by Gordon Moyer entitled “The Gregorian Calendar”.

Readers of _The URANTIA Book_ should find the calendar reform and methods of measuring time interesting. In part four of the book, “The Life and Teachings of Jesus,” there are numerous references to dates. Dates and weekdays are listed unequivocally. Is there any way to check on these dates? Was April 14 A.D. 2 really a Friday as stated? Would it make any difference if the dates and weekdays did not correlate? Would _The URANTIA Book_ be true if major discrepancies existed? Whether or not one accepts or rejects _The URANTIA Book_ is determined by its spiritual impact rather than possible scientific correlations. Still, it would be nice to know if there existed independent verification of these dates and times.

Using information obtained from the book ‘Astronamical Formulae for Calculators’ by Jean Meeus, a program was written to calculate dates and weekdays. The program takes into account the Gregorian calendar reform. All dates are first converted to Julian Day numbers and the results are divided by seven to obtain weekdays from the remainder. A calendar is then generated using this information. Even by computer standards, it is a rather tedious process.

The results were reassuring. The odds of merely guessing the correct day would be one in seven for each day or the product of the separate probabilities for all of the dates listed. This calculates to one chance in 5,764,801 for correctly guessing the eight days listed. (Now you know why bingo games are a great way of making money.) The following dates were sampled and showed correct dates with corresponding weekdays:

April 14, AD 2 Friday
June 24, AD 5 Wednesday
January 9, AD 7 Sunday
April 17, AD 9 Wednesday
April 26, Ad 2 Sunday
March 3, AD 26 Sunday
February 23, AD 26 Saturday
June 18, AD 26 Tuesday

There are more dates in _The URANTIA Book_. Perhaps other readers would like to experiment with the program. Future projects could include construction of a calendar with corresponding events listed for specific dates during the life of Jesus. A chronological guide with specific maps could become an important aid in studying part four of the book. The calendars are already available that encompass the time periods from 8 B.C. to 30 A.D.

If anyone is interested in such a project, they can contact me at the address below. The program was originally written in Microsoft Basic. Later, program enhancements were made and it was rewritten in Hypertalk to run on a Macintosh computer. A “talking” demonstration and presentation of this paper was given at the Scientific Symposium in May at Nashville. For further information contact:

## The Dutch Connection

For the first time in The Netherlands, URANTIA Book readers came together to share their experiences. The organizing committee of The Readers of _The URANTIA Book_ of Amsterdam selected the world famous centre for meditation, De Kosmos, for their commencing presentation. They all looked forward to the day after much intensive preparations. After words of welcome from Philip, the participants moved to the Zenzolder (Zen loft) to join in a group meditation guided by Gerhild. In silence, the group journeyed over our blue planet which was enlightened by a star, our sun, combined with the warmth we wish to share with all our brothers and sisters on Urantia.

The next part of the program took place in the blue room which was decorated with a collection of beautiful spiritual paintings by Gerhild. Jessy's speech was very inspiring. She explained how _The URANTIA Book_ was received by The Forum of seventy people in Chicago and about Dr. Sadler who was the facilitator of this group. Her interpretations of Jesus' miracles in the Bible, and how The URANTIA Papers brought the sought after clarity, were very inspiring.

More people entered the room during the break, and we had lunch with cherry pie and coffee — thanks to John Grit. Many of us met for the first time and several interesting exchanges were going on.

After the break, Claire talked about the attainment of the highest spiritual freedom with which one is confronted while reading the book.

Then we joined Liesbeth and Philip in the Zenzolder, and they adjusted the spiritual tunes, 'Melody has power a whole world to transform" (500:6)

### Understanding Study Group Values

When Henry began his speech, the room was almost full of people. He explained that study groups contribute to a better understanding of the book. “If the same spiritual intentions are present within the group, the results are a multiplication of these intentions.”

Mrs. Woelderen explained in her talk the reasons for the many repetitions in The URANIIA Book. “Look at a diamond, where every facet represents the whole story.”

Jean Claude continued with a talk, 'Study of _The URANTIA Book_', followed by a question and answer session.

The day was completed with a sacred dance guided by Kitty, and we enjoyed this very much. During the entire day spiritual waves were surrounding us, and truth beauty and goodness touched all of us.

### Desire for Increased Fruitfulness

Afterword: The spin-off effects of this day can still be felt. We were blessed with an increase in readership in Holland. Even those of us who had reservations about this project are now admitting the event was a fruitful one. Communications among us have improved, although there is much more work to do.

The need for a communications network in Europe, preferably with personal contacts, is quite clear. The mere exchange of newsprints alone is not effective for this purpose. It seems that the information we get from the Urantia Brotherhood does not address this need.

Our groups in The Netherlands would like to hear from you. Make your suggestions, comments or ideas to:

### Translation In The Making

The exciting new is that over two thirds of _The URANTIA Book_ has been translated into Dutch by a small group of translators for study group purposes (Like the Finnish translation). This makes the Book accessible to so many more people.

## London International Book Fair

There has been an event which might eventually prove very important for the spread of the URANTIA teachings in Britain. For the first time in this country, _The URANTIA Book_ has been exhibited on a stand at a Book Fair. The London International Book Fair, the largest of its kind in this country, was held at Olympia in London from 28th to 30th March, and on the previous weekend we had the pleasure of meeting John Hales, Resident Director, Urantia Brotherhood, and his wife; Dave Elders; and Scott Forsythe and his wife, at the home of Gez and Pamela Lamb in Harrow. We all had a very pleasant and useful visit with then, and a rare opportunity to hear at first hand about the work of what is, after all, the centre of URANTIA Book activity on the planet. One aim of our American guests' visit to the Fair was to try and find a suitable distributor for our Book through contacts made at the Fair, and as a result of these contacts, a British distributor might soon be appointed.

Up to now of course, those few bookshops that have carried _The URANTIA Book_ have had to order single copies or small batches directly from Chicago or from American distributors. We can hope that if there is a British distributor, British bookshops will be less reluctant to stock the Book and thus it will become better known.

Joining our American guests for the Book Fair was Jacques Dupont, who has done so much for the spread of the URANTIA teachings in France. As most readers will be aware, the Centre of Study and Reflection in Human Destiny (C.E.R.D.H.) with which Jacques is associated, issues a regular newsletter, “The Letter”, in English and French editions. Jacques suggested establishing a British distribution for “The Letter”, and I for one an all in favour of exchanging views and experiences with readers in other countries through this medium. Barbara Moore has kindly agreed to undertake distribution of “The Letter” in Britain.

The summer weekend gathering of URANTIA Book readers in London which has become an annual tradition, will this year be held on 6th and 7th August, and not the previous weekend as originally planned. The venue will be, as in previous years, the Lambs' home at 21 Westmorland Road, North Harrow (01-427-3593), and Henry Begemann will once again be coming over from Holland to join our gathering.

To Helen Hutchinson

I quite agree that God could never lie to us, but there is no claim in _The URANTIA Book_ that matters of science and history in the Book are all factually correct, in fact it is stated that the authors of the papers were not permitted to reveal that which was in advance of current knowledge at the time of receipt of the papers. It is also doubtful whether some authors, for example midwayers, have knowledge that is much in advance of what is now known to conventional earthlings. I see it as a supreme act of love on the part of my Father-God that I am permitted to doubt, and thus be truly a free-will personality. I also agree that scientists are far more likely to be wrong than our precious URANTIA Book, but hold that possible errors in the Book have no bearing on the veracity of its claim to be the revelation I know it to be.
