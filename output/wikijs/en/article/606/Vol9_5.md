## “Thought For The Month” 

> “Do not become discouraged by the discovery that you are human. Human nature may tend toward evil, but it is not inherently sinful. Be not downcast by your failure wholly to forget some of your regrettable experiences. The mistakes which you fail to forget in time will be forgotten in eternity. Lighten your burdens of soul by speedily acquiring a long-distance view of your destiny, a universe expansion of your career.” _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 156:5.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/156#p5_8)

## Michael's Journey Around The Earth

It was to be expected that like Homer's and Shakespeare's great literary works before, sooner or later _The URANTIA Book_ would become the inspiration for a major musical composition.

Round about 1975 the German composer Stockhausen announced that he would embark upon an opera cycle, which would be called “Licht” (light) and when complete would be designed to be performed on seven consecutive evenings. One might have thought that the plan was to begin with the first day's opera and proceed sequentially to the grand finale. But it soon became obvious that this was not the case. There is a thread of continuity linking each work to the next, but Stockhausen composed them piecemeal, an act, sometimes a scene, at a time. Each complete part is named after a day of the week and in 1985 two days were complete: “Donnerstag” (Thursday) being produced at Covent Garden and “Samstag” (Saturday) first staged in 1984 in Milan. The first part of “Licht” however to be performed, was a part of “Dienstag” (Tuesday) and was called Der “Jahreslauf” (The course of the Years). This hour-long work was first performed in 1977.

It was just by mere chance that one of the members of the Melbourne URANTIA Book study group, Ina, found a September 1985 issue of the English publication “OPERA”. Ina works for The Victorian State Opera and one day went through an old pile of magazines ready to be disposed of. What first caught her eye was a picture of the stage setting for Act 2 of “Donnerstag”: “Michael's Journey Around The Earth”. The big earth globe was rather striking, she thought.

<figure id="Figure_4" class="image urantiapedia" alt="Karlheinz">

</figure>

As she read the article, written by Andrew Clements, all of a sudden she sat up straight. She read (and I quote from Clements' article) 'Michael's childhood has obvious parallels with the composer's own unhappy early life during World War II and into it are woven characters from _The URANTIA Book_, a piece of occult arcanum that places Satan above God as the supreme ruler of our universe and which in part seems to have replaced orthodox religion (first Roman Catholicism, later Sufism) in Stockhausen's life. Eve, Lucifer and the Archangel Michael are the main characters in “Donnerstag” and they stem directly from this curious source."

It is obvious that Clements has never laid eyes on _The URANTIA Book_ and he should have stuck to what he was paid to do: Write a critique on the music of Stockhausen, which he does in a very positive way. He writes: “What remains irrefutable, however, is Stockhausen's ability to compose music of breathtaking brilliance and originality, even if such a gift visits him only irregularly.”

What is important here, however, is the fact that _The URANTIA Book_ was the source of inspiration for this composer, who, by the way, in the 1950 's belonged to a group of avant garde composers who felt that opera houses should be blown up. Opera had no relevance in this day and age, they thought. Stockhausen “must have mellowed and “Licht” is the result.

Clements writes: “Stockhausen has constructed a curious amalgam of autobiography and mysticism, there can be no doubt that in the character of Michael, played in the opera by a tenor, a dancer, and a trumpeter, there is a good deal of the young Karlheinz, a character who, one should note, ends the opera as a kind of angel 'to bring celestial music to humans and human music to the celestial beings, so that Man may listen to God and God may hear his children'.”

I hope to see this opera some day. In the meantime...I wonder if we should send Andrew Clements a copy of _The URANTIA Book_ and ask him if the opera was ever finished.

## On The Practise Of Doing The Will Of God

Each of us who have in some degree digested and assimilated the teachings in _The URANTIA Book_, come to reach a clearing beyond our loftiness and bulk and the awesomeness of our lucidity and beauty; awesomeness which easily crushes our refusal of humility.

The clearing appears barren and without novelty to tantalize us. It is only after fine scrutiny that we discover a single fruit, a solitary prompting within us. And it urges ever so gently the question, “So what do I do about it experientially?”

Then in our searching enquiry into the question, playing it by ear and fumbling most of the way, we arrive at the only and obvious solution. We've read its words and heard it told to us and even speculated upon it countless times before. Now it makes sense to us in seeming new ways, with a weight behind it which was previously absent. It is revealed within us as truth and as the only course of action which is both realistic and realistically open to us. Do the will of God.

Two often-heard questions we hear among readers are about this: what is the will of God? and how do you do it? The answers are of course always true in the lives of each respondent. And those answers are always changing and growing, embracing more, becoming more simple, becoming more real, personal and actual.

But now that we are no longer hungry for the command to do the will of God, we are intent on knowing the taste of the real thing, we find ourselves catapulted into the solitary's world. This world is the adventurer's, the truth finder's, the experiencer's domain. Slowly, slowly we wean ourselves away from searching for our answer in books and in conversations and in the answers of others — Both because they prove fruitless distractions and also because we seem to be drawn by powerful forces which urge us inward through 'being' avenues. And those forces have a carrot dangling before us: becoming real in our self.

Our original thinking about the nature of the will of God alters. Slowly our urges to evangelize the world, like there's no tomorrow, fade away. Dissolving too are our urges to nm away and become a recluse in order to uninterruptedly saviour the presence of God. And the need to write volumes of books on the topic of how our own reality has been radically changed as a result of exposure to the teachings; that too loses its nutritious substance and withers.

We find ourselves gearing down more and more so as to be able to focus on the question in real terms. We seek the workshop which is within, recognizable only in deeply personal and quiet tones of the presence of our own deliberations and knowing. A sacred venue, A true venue. The true venue of the heart and self ... where it meets God as an equal unopposed by emotion's turbulence and thought's speculations. Where confusion and doubt and fear do not enter. Where false bravado is brought to its knees under the sovereignty of truth.

But in our hunger for knowledge about the nature of the will of God, on the way to our true venue, we might research again the papers, or perhaps look to the records of our spiritual heroes who have passed on this route already. People like Francis of Assisi, the Desert Fathers of Scete, saints, gurus, sages and the like. Our eager eyes scan the historic records with hearts sensitive to the least revelation which will make clear to us in experiential terms what the will of God is actually like. We are like traffic victims who will not address our wounds but rather seek out the history of motor accidents and injuries so as to find our identity among them; the starving at a banquet who only engage the chef in questions about his profession. We are still unaware of the real food set before us.

We might often speculate about how others are doing the will of God. The man who is a healer. The woman who is a missionary. The family who spread the gospel. The hermit, the nun, the priest, the author, the counsellor, the friend. They all seem to have a mission. they all seem to know what they're doing. They all say they're doing the will of God and they sound so convincing. But oh how empty we ourselves feel. It seems everybody else know what they're doing, except us! It all seemed so easy and matter of fact for Jesus. How come it's so complex and confusing for us?

Perhaps our research takes us into the Bible's records. “(Enoch) walked with God; and he was no more, because God took him away.” ([Ge 5:24](/en/Bible/Genesis/5#v24)). “And Elijah went up to heaven in a whirlwind.” ([2Ki 2:11](/en/Bible/2_Kings/2#v11)). "He saw heaven being torn open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: 'You are my Son, whom I love; with you I an well pleased. ([Mk 1:10,11](/en/Bible/Mark/1#v10)). And we reflect that these Sons at least, among others we have no record of, did O.K. Adjuster fusion, our perfection in the doing of the will of God, had been realized.

And our doubts emerge. Daniel, for all his apparent doing of the will of God, was only destined to become a sleeping survivor ([Da 12:13](/en/Bible/Daniel/12#v13)), “As for you, go your way till the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days you will rise to receive your allotted inheritance.” And what of Adam and Eve who were Adjuster indwelt ([UB 76:5.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p5_3)), and Seth who organized an entire religious movement ([UB 76:3.4-5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/76#p3_4)) for his people: “Altogether, Seth lived 912 years and then he died.” ([Ge 5:8](/en/Bible/Genesis/5#v8)). And what about the apostles and Abner and Rodan. They seemed to have absolutely everything going for them! But they weren't fused here.

With a mind which is not yet settled in the true God-knowing venue within, it appears, at first glimpse, that only the superhuman, the one in an epoch, that extra special, unique and rare anomaly of a person who is endowed with abnormal characteristics, is capable of effectively doing the will of God with any degree of recognized success — success being evinced by hearing those seldom uttered words (on earth at least), “This is a beloved son in whom I am well pleased.” ([UB 47:8.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p8_4))

Yet, the question eats away at us, Our mind is brought to its end's tether where it cries out in its struggle, “So what do I have to do to do the will of God?!!!” And daily, hourly, the question is revoiced and respondered. All the gathered data is reviewed until not a single stone is left unturned. But still the answer remains unfound, We don't realize it, but still we are busy chatting with the chef, shouting down the noise of our turny rumbles.

Now we have become genuine in ourselves, authentic in our enquiry. We are innocently curious about it, as a child is. And we realize that doing the will of God isn't really the problem ... becoming a novice, a beginner, is, It becomes plainly clear that we only needed to find out in ourself how we personally make the doing of the will of God real. And that seems to occur by quietening down our gushy heart, having confidence in our nature and the promise of cod, and allowing something serenely assured and creative within us the opportunity to participate in the quest. Then we seem to will the rope into perfect stability, merely by the sincere wish to know the will of God ... as if the rope is our sincerity itself. And our sincerity transforms the rope, thin and wobbly as it is, into a wholly grounded huge marble floor. Where we were once perched precariously out on a limb, now we have ample room to move. Our character will not betray us, the marble will not heave us from it; we have made it so.

We have geared down sufficiently so that we don't get carried away with the emotion of the moment: charge-of-the-light-brigade-like gusto, as we once experienced it with pentecostal fervour, brings little real fruit. Our heart has become quiet.

We have stabilized our self-esteem and enthusiasm after the disappointment encountered in meeting head-on the seeming impossibility of achieving this work of doing the will of God.

> It is the abode of clearly knowing ourself, in the presence of God. It is the goal of the seeking heart, and its serenity and lucidity easily provokes simple and appropriate thought, kindly feelings, realistic aspirations, unhurried growth, a return to fundamentals and the realization that it is a supremely gentle heart and mind which discerns the presence and will of God. The needle has been threaded.

Curiously we recognize now that whereas once we wanted to invite the entire universe's population onto our own flimsy rope, now we can't and won't and don't ask a single soul to join us. For we have found the bosom of God: and it has no room for anyone else but ourself. It is the solitary's chapel. It is the hermit's cell. It is Jesus in his hour with the Father. It is home the source — that realness wherein there is no separation from God within.

It is the abode of clearly knowing ourself, in the presence of God. It is the goal of the seeking heart, and its serenity and lucidity easily provokes simple and appropriate thought, kindly feelings, realistic aspirations, unhurried growth, a return to fundamentals and the realization that it is a supremely gentle heart and mind which discerns the presence and will of God. The needle has been threaded.

From this vantage point truth observes others traversing similar steps that we ourselves covered. It sees many who energetically evangelize the gospel of threading the needle who are yet to give even a passing glance at the actual needle. It sees others who in faith have made a wild leap for the rope, hanging on by the skin of their teeth. With every passing mood or whin they shake their rope so violently as to almost dislodge themselves. And they do this in the name of their quest; thinking that the more they do the closer they'll cone to doing the will of God.

It sees man's frustrations and fears and hostilities voicing “God told me to do it”, as some kind of feeble excuse, intended to justify confusion mixed with the divine desire. It sees so much erratic rope-thumping which could be wholly avoided if only we would wait for God. Wait and be imbued with wholesomeness and sound wisdom; personality lifted to the heights of spiritual sovereignty; and without separating ourselves from the God whose will we have so genuinely sought, love with such intelligence and care that which we are and shall be, and those we meet ... in the light of who they are and who they shall become.

But all too often we interpret our own coercion to be the will of God. Our best but blinded intentions then merely put others ill at ease, or bring then to unrealistic hopes, or incite fears and divisions where none are needed. And our so called doing of the will of God liberates nothing at all! We're just running another Caligastia trip. And others, perhaps less authoritative, less commanding, less the salesperson, perhaps more naive, believe in us.

Truth reveals to the individual that the will of God is not found outside that which is absolutely real in a person. It is not found in a book or holy scripture. Nor is it found in the utterings of a psychic or holy oracle. It is not found in a dream, nor in the imagination, nor in the desires. We find the will of God in God — just as we find carrot juice in the carrot.

Truth reveals in us that there is no need of an intermediary of any kind in our doing the will of God, regardless of how holy and spiritual we construe it to be. The most feeble of us, and I'd rank myself here, don't need eloquent skills in thinking, or dazzling metaphysical techniques, or doctrates in theology. Not to do the will of God we don't. We don't even need _The URANTIA Book_, brilliant as it is. We only have to want to do the will of God. And that begins with being a beginner, being sincerely yet unemotionally interested and willing to find out. Then, a quiet “G'day ...” and what follows from that point on is so very virginal, so intimate, so ennobling, so real, so present, so much the living heart of Michael, that we wonder what all the fuss was about.

Anyone would think that doing the will of God was difficult, or special, or praiseworthy. There are some in the universe who think that that's just the way to do things and that any comment about it is like selling water by the river or congratulating an Eskimo for the way in which he shivers in the cold.

All too often we doubt ourselves and rush off to check on whether we're doing it ‘right’. And we scan the printed word, or consult with ‘the one who ought to know’ ... as if the living truth within us is less of an authority for us than the viewpoint of someone else. There's no liberation in that at all. And less spirit. The will of God stands as its own testament and is not the least swayed by replicas, Getting it ‘right’ needs careful scrutiny of the judge of its ‘rightness’.

“The Bible told me so” or “It's in _The URANTIA Book_” just doesn't cut it. It's not a real enough authority when it comes to doing the will of God. Only God is.

“Go now apart by yourselves, each man alone with the Father, and there find the unemotional answer to my question, and having found such a true and sincere attitude of soul, speak that answer freely and boldly to my Father and your Father, whose infinite life of love is the very spirit of the religion we proclaim.” ([UB 155:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/155#p5_14))

Some of us 'spread the gospel' by introducing others to _The URANTIA Book_, thinking perhaps that it is the acme of spirit. And many times we witness the hungry soul who is in our presence depart, having received no spiritual nourishment at all ... and we are left with an open URANTIA Book and a longing in our heart for 'the right thing to have said'.

But did we introduce our visitor to the utter simplicity of doing the will of God? Did we liberate him from his religious shackles? Did we disentangle him from his fruitless spiritual practices and clearly point out to him the simplicity of the matter, and the close proximity of his goal, and the effortlessness of the attainment? Or did we confound his beliefs, test his capacity to believe in a cosmology overnight which for us took years? Did we greet him, or did we greet him as someone whom we thought lacked something fundamental in his capacity to attain God?

Did we flood him with words and fantastic concepts, made more personal by the interjection of heroic spiritual ventures in our own personal history? ... a mannerism Jesus never once appears to have resorted to.

Did we spend our time pointing out the flaws in the world's myriad religions and so bolster in his mind an unqualified authority in _The URANTIA Book_? Did we endeavour to convince him that the authors have a greater authority and a special wisdom about these matters of the spirit than his own relationship with God? Did we haggle over spiritual fine print? Did we welcome him into yet another club? Did we try to get him to take a book home for his sister too? And his mother? And his boss? And his local minister?

Or perhaps we hoped to number him as one among the flock we will lead into the wilderness on sone URANTIA commune or settlement ... and that under our 'gifted' guidance and 'special' link with the authors he would realize his Adjuster fusion and be counted as among one of the chosen?

Or did we just ignore him? Did we just feel a lot safer with 'nothing ventured nothing lost'? Did we do this? Did we forget that we are a child of God first, and a URANTIA Book reader second? Did we forget that Michael is a son of God first, just like us? And he's a Michael and a Son of Man second. Did we perhaps try to sell our visitor into selling his soul out to a saviour ... be it a person like Jesus, or a book? Did we do this? Any of this? Or did we give him his own dear Father?

## Urantia — Towards Light And Life

### Easier Way

Oftentimes Australians like to find the easy way to do things. There is the story of the Australian fisherman who worked out an easy way to catch fish in a stream, using his horse and cart. He drove his horse and cart right into the stream. He poured honey onto the horse's tail. Flies came to feed on the honey. The fish came and jumped up to catch the flies. Then the horse kicked the fish onto the cart.

The history of Urantia reads like a comedy of errors. Frequently, much of the progress that was made has been lost, and has had to be achieved all over again. I have been wondering if there is an easier way for Urantia to progress, and if it is really possible to achieve it. And I have also been wondering whether I can help, and in a significant way.

### Will

Michael's own commitment, during his bestowal on Urantia, was to reveal the will of the Father. And his life on Urantia was an extraordinary demonstration of desire to attune to the will of the Father.

Personal outcomes are linked to my own act of will. A Thought Adjuster was bestowed in response to my first moral personality decision. And the Thought Adjuster, who demonstrates such divine love and extraordinary resourcefulness, is always subservient to my will.

Planetary outcomes are linked to acts of will. The decision of Andon and Fonta to flee from home was observed by every celestial intelligence stationed on Urantia, and they were all greatly concerned with what Andon and Fonta were planning. The happy outcome was celebrated on the system and constellation and universe headquarters. It resulted in a new circuitry for Urantia, and it changed the nature of the supervision of the planet.

I feel that an act of will is an important beginning in helping Urantia.

### Love of Michael

During Michael's bestowal on Urantia, his apostles and followers often failed to fully understand or appreciate his teaching. They were often bewildered and even demoralised. Yet most of his apostles and many of his followers went on to remarkable and productive careers.

What was the key thing that supported their wills and carried them forward? Their love of Michael. And after Pentecost, Michael's Spirit of Truth. When they could not comprehend, their love of Michael was sufficient.

### My First Step

There is a song called “What are you doing the rest of your life”. Well, every day for the rest of my life, 1 intend to say this prayer:

God my Father, it is my will that
Urantia achieve progress (as You will) ever more effectively.
Michael, I love you.

Do I expect to see real progress during my lifetime? Yes I Do! That song is from a motion picture called 'The Happy Ending"

I passed one who had slain thousands 
and thousands more thronged at his side 
and granted him a life of peace 
with pennants waving gaily over his lands

and I passed one who had saved thousands 
and one more came and sat by his side 
and played to him on an ancient lyre 
and kissed his hands on leave-taking

and the slayer and the savior were one man 
and the thousands slain and the 
thousands saved were one man 
and the throngs who attended the first 
and the one who sang for the last 
were one man.

And we are him. Joe Henry

## Exploring Our Own Back Yard — The Solar System

(The Layman Astronomer's Point Of View')

Sometimes, as a form of reversion from the deeper spiritual aspects of _The URANTIA Book_, it may not be a bad idea to reflect on some of the scientific or cosmic aspects which we would term as astronomy.

Well, what's all this got to do with the price of bread on Urantia, you might say.

Perhaps you could say the Sun has a lot to do with the price of bread on Urantia. But let's get more to the point and go back in time to the formation of the Solar System. _The URANTIA Book_ takes us on a journey through space, encompassing Superuniverses and massive outer space levels that extend far beyond our imagination.

So how about if we take a closer look at our own back yard first — The Solar System.

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us it is called: MONMATIA. What an incredible, breathtaking, beautiful and mysterious planetary system we live in. Big question marks still follow many of our statements about the Solar System; until of course our space probes reveal more.

The following is my own perspective, after reading the relative sections in _The URANTIA Book_, and our present day knowledge revealed from space exploration, ( not necessarily up to date, or indeed altogether correct; if anyone can throw more light on the subject, I would be grateful for the information.)

Origin of Monmatia is [UB 57:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p5_1).

Our Solar System of planets, moons, asteroids, meteors, space dust and all that stuff, was formed when the giant ANGONA system, the centre of which was a dark giant of space with tremendous gravity pull. Indeed, pull it did, drawing off enough Solar Mass to start the formation of a planetary system. Bulging in the centre and tapered at the ends, this enormous stream of gaseous matter transformed into the TWELVE PLANETS of the solar system.

Jupiter and Saturn were formed from the large bulging centre of the solar extrusion. From these two planets, the others are referred to as the FIVE INNER and FIVE OUTER planets. Bear in mind today we officially only recognize NINE planets from Earth.

Just hold on to your planets for a moment, there is more to come.

When the ANGONA system came closer to our solar mass, THREE of its outer planets were captured by our system. Using my vast knowledge of mathematics: 12 + 3 = 15. Fifteen planets that is.

So who has been playing planetary billiards with our solar system?

Reading on further in _The URANTIA Book_, we find that the fifth planet was captured by Jupiter when traversing an irregular orbit and was fragmentized.

FOURTEEN planets are now left.

NINE accounted for by astronomers on Earth to this day.

So now we enter the realms of almost complete hypothesis. Here goes:

One other planet was fragmentized by tidal friction by either Saturn or Jupiter.

One (or two) dark gravity spheres exist beyond the orbit of Pluto.

One or more of the giant moons orbiting ( either/or Saturn, Jupiter or Neptune) are captured planets. Mystery Solved? (maybe not)

To continue the saga I'll point out some relevant knowledge from our own Earth sources and interspace with statements from _The URANTIA Book_. (marked U.B.)

Jupiter has 14 (?) moons orbiting this enormous gaseous planet which is more than eleven times the diameter of Earth.

> “...they were in reality secondary suns for a short period after their formation as separate space bodies.” (Jupiter and Saturn) [UB 57:5.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p5_10)

> “Many of these enormous spheres have satellites, sometimes a half dozen or more, and these moons are often in size very near that of Urantia, so that they are almost ideal for habitation.” [UB 49:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p0_4)

Saturn has ten satellites, the largest being TITAN which is larger than Mercury and has an atmosphere thought to consist mainly of Nitrogen. (earlier accounts stated methane) Vigorous volcanic action has been photographed on one of Jupiter's moons called I-O.

Other large moons of Jupiter called Ganymede, Callisto and Europa seem to have ice deposits on them. They also seem to absorb large amounts of radiation emitted by Jupiter. The electron bursts are said to reach Earth and even as far as Mercury.

Uranus is tilted at about 90&deg; to the ecliptic and has retrograde rotation. Its outer neighbour Neptune has a large moon Triton, which has retrograde motion.

> “Retrograde motion in any astronomic system is always accidental and always appears as a result of the collisional impact of foreign space bodies. Such collisions may not always produce retrograde motion, but no retrograde ever appears except in a system containing masses which have diverse origins.” [UB 57:5.14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p5_14)

The most important aspect is of course the life on the planets.

> “Beings such as the Urantia races are classified as mid-breathers; you represent the average or typical breathing order of mortal existence. If intelligent creatures should exist on a planet with an atmosphere similar to that of your near neighbour, Venus, they would belong to the superbreather group, while those inhabiting a planet with an atmosphere as thin as that of your outer neighbour, Mars, would be denominated subbreathers.” 
> 
> “If mortals should inhabit a planet devoid of air, like your moon, they would belong to the separate order of nonbreathers.” ( 112% of inhabited Satania worlds) [UB 49:2.13-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p2_13)

> “You would be more than interested in the planetary conduct of this type of mortal because such a race of beings inhabits a sphere in close proximity to Urantia.” [UB 49:3.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p3_6)

I have tried to imagine what it would be like to be a nonbreather, by holding my breath for long periods, but eventually get very dizzy. How then do these beings cope with being dizzy all the time? If we encountered these mortals, would we accept them as they are, or try to convert them to breatherism?

> SATANIA — “Its 619 inhabited worlds are located in over five hundred different physical systems. Only five have more than two inhabited worlds, and of these only one has four peopled planets, while there are forty-six having two inhabited worlds.” [UB 32:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/32#p2_10)

> “In your solar system only three planets are at present suited to harbor life.” [UB 15:6.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_15)

I wonder how close we came to.having mortal neighbours in our planetary system. But of course our space probes have proven conclusively there is not even a basic living cell in the rest of our solar system.

Personally, I feel uneasy about making such dogmatic statements; what do you think?

## The Three Missing Planets

On page 656 of _The URANTIA Book_, we are informed that five inner planets, Jupiter, Saturn, and five outer planets formed the material drawn out from our sun by the passing Angona system. This adds up to 12 planets, but we are only taught about nine in school. Where are the other three?

One of the missing planets is easy to account for. On page 658 we read that the fifth planet from the sun was pulled apart when it passed too close to Jupiter. The debris from this planet forms the present astroid belt that lies between Mars and Jupiter. This leaves two planets unaccounted for.

Within the past several years, astronomers studying Pluto and its companion Charon have decided that Charon may not be a satellite of Pluto; this system may be two planets orbiting about a common point. If this is true, then only one planet is left unaccounted for..

To understand how the 12th planet may be found, it is desirable to look at how several other planets were discovered. As astronomers studied the orbit of Uranus around the sun, they noted perturbations in its orbit. From this fact, the existence of another planet was predicted. In 1846, the planet responsible for these perturbations was discovered and named Neptune. Similarly, the orbit of Neptune was found to be perturbed. This triggered the search for the so-called planet X. The search for this turned up Pluto in 1930. Study of Pluto has however revealed that it is much too small to be Planet X. Some astronomers feel that there is something out there causing the perturbations, but have been unable to find it.

An article in the 1988 issue of ASTRONOMY entitled “The Pull of Planet X” discusses the possibility of another planet beyond the orbit of Jupiter. The Planet X hypothesis is not accepted by all astronomers, but most agree that something is disturbing the orbit of Neptune, and possibly Uranus as well. It could be the 12th planet, or it could be one of the massive dark islands of space referred to by _The URANTIA Book_. It could even be both of these possibilities. If that is the case, the astronomers ought to have a great time trying to sort it all out. The astronomers are diligently seeking the 12th planet; perhaps we will soon be able to put it on our astronomical charts.

## Gentle As Silence

Oh, the love of my Lord is the essence 
of all that I love here on earth.
All the beauty I see
He has given to me
And his giving is gentle as silence.

Every day, every hour, every moment
Have been blessed by the strength of his love.
At the turn of each tide
He is there at my side,
And his touch is as gentle as silence.

There've been times when I've turned from his presence, 
And I've walked other paths, other ways.
But I've called on his name
In the dark of my shame,
And his mercy was gentle as silence.

## News From Urantia Foundation

Book Distribution

The latest issue of the URANTIAN reported that in 1987 book distribution was the best ever. In fact over 12.800 books were distributed. This included sales, gifts and library placements for both the English and French version. Sales in 1988 are comparable to last year's.

Translations

The Finnish translation is in its third draft. The Finns have financed the translation for over twenty years. Now the Foundation hopes to fund the printing once the translation is complete.

The Spanish translation is still progressing, although at a slower pace than anticipated. Andite Corporation, an affiliate of URANTIA Foundation has been in close contact with the translator to see what can be done to speed up the completion.

Library Placement

The URANTIA Foundation has offered an almost limitless supply of _The URANTIA Book_ and _Le Livre d'URANTIA_ for the library placement program. It has also agreed to pay for mass mailings to libraries. For more information readers outside of the U.S. should contact the International Fellowship Committee. Readers in the U.S. contact the Domestic Extension Committee, both at 533 Diversey Parkway, Chicago, IL. 60614, USA.

More and more letters are received describing how a new reader found the book in a library. If you have placed a book in a library, go and check it at least once a year. If it has gone ‘walkabouts’ the Foundation is happy to replace it. Just talk to the librarian first to see if they would like another copy.

Erroneous Library Cataloguing

Some libraries still incorrectly list _The URANTIA Book_ under its old Dewey Decimal classification number of 133 Parapsychology and Occultism. 'In 1975 the Foundation persuaded the Library of Congress to change the number to 299 Other Religions. Please check your library to see if the book is correctly listed.

## Interfaith Symposium

The Indianapolis Urantia Book Study Group held an interfaith symposium last July. Speakers from different religions were invited and included some from : Baha'i Faith, Tibetan Buddhism, Roman Catholicism, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Lakota-Sioux (Native American Church of Indiana) Sikh and Taoism. Our friend Dana Poole reported that it was a real success.

## News From Seattle

P.L.U.S.S. (Pilot Light Urantia Society of Seattle) held their charter ceremony in March this year.

It was a special occasion, although their patience, tolerance and nerves were truly tested, due to a thunderous din in the rooms below which continued for most of the night. The remembrance supper was led by our old friend Gwen Blackham, who some of us might remember. Gwen was also one of the organizers of 'The Couples Enhancement Weekend', which was held at Camp Gilead in Carnation, WA.USA. Eight couples attended. It became a wonderful experience of quality sharing, information and good humor. All participants agreed that they could do with another dose of the same.

## News From Canada

The 8th Geneva Park Conference in Orillia was held last June near Lake Couchiching. Urantia Book readers in Ontario had drafted a constitution for the proposed Couchiching Urantia Society of Ontario, which was adopted at the June conference. Executive officers and Committee Chairmen were also elected. Theme for the conference was: “Service, our Highest Motive”.

The Québec Conference

Members of different study groups from French Canada met at Lac Beauport on the outskirts of Québec. It had been 4 years since the last encounter. The theme for the conference was'_The URANTIA Book_ In Our Daily Lives'. The Canadian newsletter “Prints of Peace” reported: “The provincial meeting was indeed a memorable one, for it reached exceptional spiritual heights which translated into deep joy in our souls. All participants expressed the hope that another provincial meeting be held in 1989”.

Last fall, during a special meeting aimed at looking for new ways to structure the URANTIA movement in Québec, 16 readers agreed to form a ‘service team’ whose goal would be to answer the needs of the readers of the province. In many respects the objectives resemble the ones of a society, but in Quebec they are not yet ready to join in the Brotherhood's system of Societies.

Next October, the 11th Book Fair will take place in Montréal. For the first time a stand has been leased and will read ‘Les Lecteurs du Livre d'URANTIA’.

A Concordex of Articles (Répertoire des Oeurres) has been completed which has been in the making for more than a year, It consists of a listing of 206 articles in French, from 44 authors. It includes a summary of each article as well as the coordinates of the respective author. Its cost is $10 in Canada, $11 in the U.S. and $12 overseas.

There are presently 10 study groups located in four areas: Montréal, Québec, Trois Rivieres and Sherbrooke.

There is also a Spiritual Sharing Group (Groupe de Partage Spirituel). This new type of weekly meetings was started a few years ago in Montreal as an alternative to the usual study group. The members meditate, then write about their worship experience after which an oral presentation is made by each member while the others listen without commenting. This takes about one hour. The second hour is mostly spent sharing related personal experiences or discussing spiritual matters. They then share the evening meal.

_The URANTIA Book_ is not used during these meetings but up to now members have always been, or become, readers of the book.

Réflectivité is the French Canadian newsletter. It is published once a month and is mostly informative in nature. It is a single 8&frac12; x 14 sheet typed on both sides and folded. The mailing list is currently 250. Distribution is free although donations are welcome.
