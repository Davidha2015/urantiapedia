## A note from 6-0-6

This issue of our newsletter, the last one for 1988, we have mainly dedicated to reporting on the South Pacific Regional Meeting of Readers of _The URANTIA Book_, held at Ranelagh House, Robertson, N.S.W. 10th — 14th October 1988. There is no doubt in the minds of the people who attended that it was a great success but one that has left us lost for words to describe the real experience. It is a real credit to the organizers Kathleen and Trevor Swadling, William Wentworth and Neil Francey.

We bring you Kathleen's report and a few of the presentations given at this meeting. Due to lack of space we will hold the rest of the presentations over to the next issue of Six-0-Six.

The 6-0-6 wishes all of you a safe and joyous Christmas and New Year. We like to take this opportunity to thank all our readers for their continued support during 1988 and are looking forward to strenghtening the bonds of friendship in 1989, our 10th year of publication.

## “Thought For The Month” 

> “Though you cannot find God by searching, if you will submit to the leading of the indwelling spirit, you will be unerringly guided, step by step, life by life, through universe upon universe, and age by age, until you finally stand in the presence of the Paradise personality of the Universal Father”. _The URANTIA Book_ [UB 2:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p5_5)

## A Psalm Of Life

Tell me not, in mournful numbers 
Life is but an empty dream, 
For the soul is dead that slumbers 
And things are not what they seen.

Life is real! Life is earnest! 
And the grave is not its goal. 
Dust thou art, to dust returnest, 
Was not spoken of the soul.

Not enjoyment, and not sorrow 
Is our destined end or way; 
But to act that each tomorrow 
Finds us farther than today.

Art is long, and time is fleeting 
And our hearts though stout and brave, 
Still, like muffled dreams, are beating 
Funeral marches to the grave.

In the world's broad field of battle, 
In the bivouac of life, 
Be not like dumb, driven cattle 
Be a hero in the strife.

Trust no future, however pleasant! 
Let the dead past bury its dead! 
Act — act is the living present! 
Heart within, and God o'erhead!

Lives of great men all remind us 
We can make our lives sublime, 
And, departing, leave behind us 
Footprints on the sands of time;

Footprints, that perhaps another 
Sailing over life's solemn main, 
A forlorn and shipwrecked brother, 
Seeing, shall take heart again.

Let us, then, be up and doing, 
With a heart for any fate; 
Still achieving, still pursuing 
Learn to labour and to wait.

Longfellow

Presented by Peter Webb at the South Pacific Regional Meeting of URANTIA Book Readers, October 1988.

## Fiji Presents

by Isireli U. Racule

Greetings of “Bula Vinaka” from the Islands of Fiji to you our brothers and sisters in Australia and neighbour nations of Planet 606, Urantia, assembled here, in this mansion home Ranelagh, Robertson, this day and week. We welcome you, into our hearts and love!

Marica (Martha) my dear wife (in absentia, in Bonnyrigg, N.S.W.) and I, Isireli(Isi), bring to you in person the hopes and best wishes of _the URANTIA Book_ readers of Fiji, that the Pacific Regional Meeting, 1988 of Australia be a success and a major step forward in the development and advancement of the Gospel of Jesus in the form of _The URANTIA Book_ for the planet, this day and age, — the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man.

Fiji, a little more than 150 years ago, became a Christian country of two major sects of Christianity, — Methodist, a liberty moderated Church in 1835, and Roman Catholic, a tradition and ritual laden one, in 1844, whose world leader we know, has always been the Pope in Rome. And, we know, too, that Christianity, a world religion, established by Paul, nineteen and a half centuries ago, is today so sect-1aden with so much unnecessary differences of opinions and conceptual beliefs, that the peoples experience no unity and harmony in the churches of Christendom.

The standard of church music in the Fiji Christian churches is very high, and being the language of the universes and the Paradise Havona worlds is full of lingering harmony with no discord. But, in the Christian churches themselves, let alone other religions, there is a lot of discord and harmony throughout life for almost 2000 years. We truly hope, that such a state of disharmony and disunity will someday lift and be lifted, and we know too well that Urantia at the moment is still under ‘quarantine’ as the result of the Lucifer Rebellion, and when this shall be lifted no one knows.

We as Urantians, members of the Brotherhood or not, have been admonished by the midwayer commission (in the 77 Jesus Papers 120 — 196) that we should remember well to keep whole and never be divided into sects, keeping in mind the Christian slogan: “A house divided against itself cannot stand!!” (For “united” we stand, and “divided” we fall!) Urantians, all, be united always and forever, in the Fatherhood of God and the Brotherhood of Man!!

May God be with us all in this great Conference!!!

Vinaka!


## Report On The South Pacific Regional Meeting Of Readers Of The Urantia Book

October 10th-14th 1988

THEME: CULTURAL DIVERSITY AND SPIRITUAL UNITY

by Kathleen Swadling

I would like to give a brief outline of the events at our recent South Pacific Meeting, even though it may be hard for the words I use to convey the meaning and value of the whole experience. I'm sure everyone who participated will agree that it was an “event of a lifetime”. As Neil Francey said in his closing comments: “We'll all find ourselves simply saying to people ‘you should have been there’” and this is so true. There's no substitute for experience. Nevertheless I shall endeavour to summarise the week and share with you a glimpse of its value.

Day 1 — Monday was mainly filled with arrivals, reunions, registrations and generally settling in. It began with a bit of anxiety at the Sydney airport as the plane carrying the bulk of our American friends, travelling from Cairns, was delayed due to mechanical problems. However, they arrived only one hour late and the bus, which we hired, transported a merry crew down to Robertson. Meanwhile, independent arrivals were happening throughout the morning at Ranelagh House. This venue chosen proved to be a tremendous success. It is an old manor house which was built in the 1920 era and which can accommodate up to a hundred guests. Everyone was impressed by the quality of the house, the rooms, the service and the food, all at a reasonable low price. Our thanks to Ian Esmore for suggesting it. It was perfect for the occasion; all our physical needs were taken good care of , which left us free to explore more important matters. We had a brief introduction session where the basic theme of cultural diversity and spiritual unity was introduced. A brief explanation of the programme and general goals were explained. We were hoping that by using this opportunity of getting to know readers from around the world and sharing our different cultures with one another, we would gain more of an understanding of each others' ways which would bring us a step closer to the international union of URANTIA Book readers and the breaking down of national barriers, which is so desperately needed for a true Brotherhood of Man under the Fatherhood of God.

I feel that goal was achieved in the hearts of those who were present. The evening was passed with much socializing and the first showing of a number of videos which Berkeley Elliott brought with her. These videos (more commonly known as multi-medias) are top value and have a lot of thought, time and effort put into them by URANTIA Book readers in the United States.

Day 2 — Tuesday was the real springboard into the theme. This day was coordinated by William Wentworth who arranged with a representative of every country present, to give a presentation on their country and on events with _The URANTIA Book_ in that country. The countries present were Australia, New Zealand, Fiji, Tahiti, Hong Kong, France, Switzerland, England, Finland and the USA. Each presenter reflected his or her own cultural flavour, but their commitment to the revelation was unified.

The quality of the experience left an impression too deep for words and certainly sought to strengthen our bonds with all mankind. I shall leave it to William to give a more detailed summary of this day.

Day 3 — Wednesday. This was a day of leasure and relaxation. A bus took us on a tour of the surrounding district and stopped at some beautiful locations for our visitors to see what a lovely country this is. We ate a picnic lunch near a river and drove back to Robertson early afternoon. People broke up to wander around the lovely gardens of Ranelagh House, see the animals held in a small reserve, swim or sleep. Late afternoon was taken up with some informal study and discussion around _The URANTIA Book_. In the evening we had a “trivial pursuit” of _The URANTIA Book_. We broke into teams of 6 or 7 and attempted to answer a series of questions concerning the book. This was certainly a lot of fun and produced much witticism and side-splitting laughter. After that we had a talent night where music and poetry was shared. We were fortunate to have in our midst Urs Ruchti from Switzerland who is a concert pianist and who kindly performed for us and consequently sent our souls soaring.

Day 4 — Thursday. This was a day of thoughtful presentations and discussions by various individuals. Ken Glasziou from Queensland presented a topic on the scientific content of _The URANTIA Book_. This was well presented and extremely interesting. Trevor Swadling from Sydney presented a topic on ‘survival statistics’ which gave everyone much food for thought. As Betty Glasziou commented at the end: “It has jolted us out of our complacency”. Both Ken and Trevor have prepared detailed summaries of their presentations to place in the 6-0-6 Newsletter.

The afternoon was filled with presentations by representatives of the URANTIA Brotherhood. Mary Lou Hales, a one-time Forum member, shared with us some of her experiences of the “olden days” in the URANTIA Movement. She certainly added a tone of wisdom and composure to the day. Dave Elders, the president of the URANTIA Brotherhood gave us his philosophical viewpoint on the purpose of the URANTIA Brotherhood and the advantages of having such an organization. He used a sketch of an upside-down triangle to support his ideas with the URANTIA Foundation and Brotherhood at the base representing a supportive role, with the societies, study groups and individuals working their way to the top respectively. It was the most sane explanation I've ever heard for the justification of an organization and hopefully Dave will present a summary for us to include in the 6-0-6 Newsletter. John Hales spoke on the more physical aspects of the organization and was bombarded with many questions. Berkeley Elliott spoke briefly on the International Fellowship Committee. I'd like to mention here that the quiet, unobtrusive efforts of this wonderful woman largely (if not wholly) contributed to the actual coming together of so many on the international scene. Humility, unpretentiousness, genuineness and a good sense of humour were outstanding features (in my opinion) of these URANTIA Brotherhood spokesmen. I think many of us felt that the organization is a planetary one — not an American one — after this day. It will be the input from all countries concerned that will make it a truly world-wide movement.

Thursday evening was ‘foot tappin time’. An Australian bush-band “Sunup” played for us and taught us many new terms such as ‘strip the willow’, ‘dosey doe’ and the heel toe polka. A good time was had by all. It was a good opportunity to work off some of the good food we'd been eating. Next morning saw many wounded bodies as unexercised calf muscles hindered some of our movements.

Day 5 — Friday. How many of us awoke this morning with saddened hearts that it was all coming to an end much too soon? But to quote a verse from a song by Paul Stookey:

"And I was wondering if you had been to the mountain And looked at the valley below,

Had you seen all the roads tangled down in the valley Did you know which way to go?

For the mountain stream runs pure and clear

And I wish to my soul I could always be here.

There's a reason for living way down in the valley, But only the mountain knows."

Perhaps this week was like a visit to the mountain and helped us to see more clearly which of the many tangled roads we must take while living our day to day lives in the valley.

Friday morning saw the last of the presentations. One from Chris Moseley from England on prospects for a world religion. What a well thought out and excellent presentation this was. Chris has a broad general knowledge of state and religious affairs around the world, which made his talk extremely interesting and stimulating. The other presentation was by Peter Webb from W.A. on the truth in all religions. This was a very thoughtful and sincere presentation as Pete got to the guts of diferentiating between facts, meanings and values. This stimulated much discussion and sharing of personal experiences. The rest of the day was involved with photographs, preparations and farewells.

So ended a fantastic event, but one which will remain dear and true to us all forever more. This opportunity to make friends with people from all over the world cammitted to this fifth Epochal Revelation gives one a feeling of hope and purpose, comfort and security, faith and trust; a feeling of planetary unity and citizenship. There's a huge task ahead of us as individuals and as members of groups. If we remain true to the highest within us and united in spirit with our fellows, I feel sure we can set this revelation on the road to success. _The URANTIA Book_ does confidently claim that the teachings of Jesus will one day rule this very world. All epochal revelations are designed to upstep our evolutionary spiritual progress on a planetary scale, but it rests heavily on us mortals as to the degree of its success.

“United we stand, divided we fall”. Let's stick together with this revelation so we can check or support one another as we attempt to live the truths we have gleaned from this amazing book.

## A Service Perspective Of Individual And Organizational Relationships

A talk given by David Elders at the Pacific Regional Meeting of readers of _The URANTIA Book_

Ranelagh House, Robertson, Australia 13 October 1988

> “Concerning insight, the recognition of moral values and the discernment of spiritual meanings, all that the human mind can do is to discover, recognize, interpret, and choose.” ([UB 196:3.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_10))

> “To a man with a harmer, the whole world looks like a nail!” Anonymous.

What we each believe something to be and what it really is are often two very different things. For example, when one person calls another person an “American” or a “Frenchman” or an “Australian”, it is often meant to suggest a stereotypical view of who that person is. But, in reality, all that is really being said is where the person was born (not of his/her choice, incidentally) or their current place of residence. However, once said, the national label is a prejudice or bias which to some degree acts to control the relationship that person has with others. Since no one person ever fits the stereotype anyway, it is only through interaction on a personal level with the labeled person that the bias can drop away to be replaced by a relationship now less encumbered by preconception. But what has really changed? I would suggest that the only change is in the attitude of the person tempted to label another (using a label may just be an easy way to avoid having to think about a person very much).

Perhaps the same is true about what an organization is as well. Since an organization is not a person, but a mechanism, it is not self-acting. In the end, all organizations are really a collection of persons acting in some agreedupon way, together. Fear of an organization is misplaced; rather, any anxiety with regard to organizational intent or action would better be directed toward the people who comprise it. As in the example above, however, we should not be tempted too quickly to label the organization either good or bad, either useful or dangerous. If we fear it, we are already its slave and have fulfilled our own prophecy by the attitude we adopt, which may not necessarily represent the way it really is. If we approach organization with the attitude of using it as a mechanism to serve a particular purpose or function, we are in a position to master both the mechanism and our human tendency to abuse it for the control of others (who may unwittingly participate in the process by fearing organization).

How we look at URANTIA Brotherhood and URANTIA Foundation organizations exemplifies how a change in attitude can seemingly transfer these organizations from tools of power and control into mechanisms of service. On diagram A, the various relationships between these organizations and the individual readers of _The URANTIA Book_ are depicted hierarchically in the normal human, business way. URANTIA Foundation is at the top, apparently in full control of the work of the individuals who comprise the entire reader community, thereby doing just what the book warns against, tempting us to divert our service from each other and God to the organization itself. However, diagram B shows what happens if we change our attitude toward and view of these organizations to be more in line with their stated purpose and reason for existence. In this view, what I have termed a “service view” each of the organizational elements serve the levels above themselves, ultimately serving each individual in his/her relationship with God, and the God in each and every other. In this model, the organizational element most closely tied to the evolutionary soil in which the revelation was planted is URANTIA Foundation, that organization responsible for the preservation of the text and the service marks designed to identify the originally-given material as mechanisms to protect it from misuse and distortion. Their work supports directly URANTIA Brotherhood, whose task it is to help with “the study and dissemination of the teachings of _The URANTIA Book_ ... through the medium of fraternal association...” and, as a result, all the study, sharing, personal relationship levels above. In this way, all the work is designed, ultimately, to serve (not manage or control) the integrity of each individual to relate directly and without intermediary with God.

Just as the potential of spirit existence resides in the mortal creature of animal origin and action, so the potential for true, collective service resides in the mechanism of the organization. In both cases, it is by our choosing that the potentials are realized. Fear is a poor motivation in both cases, and leads to the wrong achievements-continued animalistic behaviour in the person, abuse of power and control in the organization. The right attitude, however, will facilitate the proper choices enabling us together to use our organizations as a means to do our work on behalf of this revelation.

One final thought on this subject: If we tend to view the existing organizations now predominantly functioning in America as “American” and tie that view into the control model of organizational risk depicted in diagram A, we cannot achieve the dream of becoming a true planetary demonstration of the ability of these teachings to enable us to overcome virtually every obstacle to working together. We, thereby, will have allowed our fear to make our decisions for us and will have fulfilled our own prophetic concerns. If, however, we adopt an attitude toward these same organizational entities of utilizing them as the worldwide skeletal framework and support mechanism for our collective cooperation, and begin to identify ourselves as planetary citizens comprising a planetary organization with the purposes as stated, we can fulfill that vision, too, through a conscious decision-making process. Fear forces us to interact with reality in a protective mode to avoid taking risks; seeking a higher goal allows us to interact with reality in a more creative manner, so that we may actualize the potentials which exist. The quotations at the beginning of this paper seem to tell the tale.

DIAGRAM A

The human or business view of organization

<figure id="Figure_2" class="image urantiapedia" alt="diagram">
<img src="/image/article/606/diagrama.jpg">
</figure>

This view is not acceptable and if enacted would lead to maintenance of organization as an end.

DIAGRAM B

The SERVICE PERSPECTIVE view of organization

<figure id="Figure_3" class="image urantiapedia" alt="diagram">
<img src="/image/article/606/diagramb.jpg">
</figure>

This view desirable and would lead to utilization of organization as a means to the accomplishment of higher ends.



Over the coming years, many groups — good, bad, and indifferent — will seek to identify themselves with The URANIIA Book and claim its truths as their own. By coming together, voluntarily, in a single planetary organization expressive of our willingness to identify with a larger group of humankind, socially, at a level above the normal separators of language, race, national origin, and differences of opinion, etc., we have a unique opportunity to demonstrate to the world at large our commitment to the supreme principles of true cooperation so clearly elucidated in the book. At the same time, those other smaller organizations, whatever their value and motivation, will come and go as the personal expression of singular or small groups of like-minded individuals, but by.virtue of the existence of a planet-wide organization comprised of many different people. _The URANTIA Book_ will not be so easily labeled — such as “American”, or “Christian”, or “Western”, or “Evangelists”, or “Promoters”, or “White”, or “Commercial”, etc. — thereby making it less accessible to other members of our planetary community who may themselves have identified with groups.

We must work together to prove to others that this teaching can enable us to transcend our surface differences, as it would seem revelation is meant to do. Since we are born into absolute diversity (by virtue of our unique personalities) and are seeking unity, it would seem that the oft-spoken risk of uniformity is slight. If we presume unity as already achieved and seek instead to expand our outer differences, we may experientially achieve neither true personality diversity nor unity. If with our help our organization achieves its intended purposes, to serve as collective support for the integrity of each, person's unique reach toward God, we may be able to achieve and fully experience both the very unity and diversity of personality as sons and daughters of a common Father. If we keep our viewpoint aligned, we will remember that both _The URANTIA Book_ and its associated organizations are not ends in themselves, but simply means.

Next Issue: How Many Mortals Survive From Our Mailbag, by Trevor Swadling

## From Our Mailbag

Greetings,

Hi. to those of you whom I have met and those whom I have not! Wish I were able to come in October to your South Pacific Conference to meet you all!! But, alas, not this time...

Six-0-Six is, by far, one of the most thoroughly enlightening vehicles of information and forum for stimulating thought \& discussion, that I've encountered! The articles and topics certainly are mind-stretchers and thought-ideastimulants! A desire to encourage you to continue this newsletter is the motive behind this letter!

I don't have the particular paper in front of me, but want to thank the person who shared the “dream of Thought Adjuster arrival” a few months ago. At the time I received this paper, I was attending Unity School, near Kansas City, Missouri, USA. I photocopied the article and shared it with more than 25 people!

Your newsletter is circulated around our Incenders (local study group) and sometimes I lose one. I always regret that, because I often refer back to previous articles. I have searched $m y$ back issues for the one with the “case against reincarnation” and the one comparing the figurine of the old Chinese man with VAN of _The URANTIA Book_, unsuccessfully.

It would be appreciated more than I can say if you could photocopy the back issues with the information about reincarnation in it, and send it to me. Summer or Fall 1987 issue, I think. Thanks.

I especially appreciate the inclusion in your paper of some of the most outstanding articles from other URANTIA Book newsletters from around the world.

Enclosed is a little something to help defray postage costs. I get so much out of your newsletter I certainly want to insure that it continues to come to me!

Patije Mills, Sarasota, FL. USA

Editors note: I particularly want to share this pat on the back with all our wonderful contributors and hope it is an encouragement for many of our readers to keep on writing!

## Science And _The Urantia Book_

Sunnary Of Scientific And Historic Material That Appears To Have Required Access To Certain Knowledge

Presented at the South Pacific Regional Meeting of Readers of _The URANTIA Book_, by Dr. Ken T. Glasziou

The URANTIA Papers were received in 1934 and published in book form in 1955. There are many items of a scientific or historic nature about which definite statements are made in _The URANTIA Book_, and about which mankind had no certain knowledge during the pre-publication period. Many of these items have since been found to be either correct or to now coincide with current scientific opinion. This paper summarizes some of these items.

### Days And Dates

In the section covering the life of Jesus, various dates can be associated with a particular day of the week. Our calendar has changed considerably since those times such that it would be a Herculean task to attempt to correctly assign the day of the week to a particular date without the aid of a computer. Even with a computer, this is still an onerous task. Dr. Matt Neibaur has done this for eight different dates and found that in each case _The URANTIA Book_ has named the correct day of the week for those dates. The chances of succeeding through guesswork alone are one chance in more than 5 million.

Reference: Computer analysis of dates in _The URANTIA Book_, M. Neibaur, Proc. First Scientific Symposium of URANTIA Book Readers, Nashville Tennessee. (1988)

### Star Of Bethlehem

_The URANTIA Book_ states that the source of the biblical account of the Star of Bethlehem (of three wise men fame), was conjunctions of the planets Saturn and Jupiter in the Constellation of Pisces on May 29, September 29, and December 5 of the year 7 B.C.

British astronomer, David Hughes has plotted the planetary circuits backwards from their present positions to verify these conjunctions actually took place. This was a Herculean task even with the aid of a computer.

References: “Why I believe _The URANTIA Book_”, H. McMullen, (1986), (Asoka Foundation Publications, Oklahoma City, OK) “The star of Bethlehem”, David Hughes, (1979)

### Particle Physics

In a paper received in 1934 , _The URANTIA Book_ ([UB 42:8.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p8_6)) has described the weak force carrier, the release of tiny neutral particles (antineutrinos) in radioactive beta decay, the release of more tiny neutral particles during gravitational collapse of massive stars (neutrinos), and the existence of a then unknown strong nuclear force.

The existence of the weak force carrier was demonstrated in 1983, the existence of neutrinos was confirmed in 1956, the existence of neutron stars whose formation gives rise to the release of vast quantities of neutrinos was confirmed by X ray telescope in 1967, and the theory of the strong nuclear force involving quarks and gluons became accepted theory during the late 1970's.

Reference: “Two Remarkable Predictions”, K.T. Glasziou, 6-0-6 Newsletter, vol 9 (no 3), 1988; (also available in The Brotherhood of Man Library).

### Continental Drift

_The URANTIA Book_ states unequivocally that all land on earth was joined together in one huge continent that commenced to break up 760 million years ago, and was followed by a long period of continental drifting during which land bridges were repeatedly formed and broken.

The concept of continental drift was rejected by most geologists and geophysicists until examination of the ocean floor at the mid-Atlantic Ridge during the late 1950's and early 1960's revealed that the Earth's crust is being melted and forced upwards resulting in ocean floor spreading, hence continental drift.

Until recently, the date of conmencement of break up of the single large continent was placed at about 200 million years ago. Currently this date has been revised and pushed back to between about 600 and 800 million years ago as stated in _The URANTIA Book_.

ibid., (1987), 256(4), 84 .

### Mountain Building

_The URANTIA Book_ associates mountain building on the west coast of North and South America with continental drift. Today, nobody doubts that mountain building occurs at the edge of drifting continents, concomitantly with the subduction of the oceanic crust. However virtually nobody believed in continental drift at the time of writing (or publication) of _The URANTIA Book_. 

Reference: _The URANTIA Book_, [UB paper:60.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/paper#p60_3)2.

### Stable Elements

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that atoms with more than 100 orbital electrons are unstable, and quickly decay. Element 101 (Mendelium) was discovered in the products of nuclear fission in 1952, and was found to have a half-life of about 30 minutes. All elements above 100 have since been found to be highly unstable. There was no adequate theoretical basis to make such a prediction at the time of receipt or publication of The URANTIA Papers.

Reference: _The URANTIA Book_, [UB 42:7.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p7_7).

### Planetary Atmospheres.

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that Venus has a dense atmosphere and that the atmosphere of Mars is of low density. The Russian Venera 7 space probe measured the atmospheric pressure of Venus in 1970 at about 90 times the Earth's atmosphere, and the U.S. Mariner probe gave the atmosphere of Mars as 1/100 of the Earth's atmosphere. There was no way to predict or to measure atmospheric pressure on these planets before the advent of the space probes.

Reference: _The URANTIA Book_, [UB 49:2.10-16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p2_10).

### Motion Of The Moon

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that the moon is presently moving away from the Earth. This has been confirmed by highly accurate radar measurements. The rate of movement is about 1 inch per year.

References: _The URANTIA Book_, [UB 57:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p6_2).

### Tycho Brahe's Nova Of 1572

The explosion of a supernova in 1572 was a brilliant spectacle visible in broad daylight, and became known as Tycho Brahe's nova. _The URANTIA Book_ states that this nova was due to the explosion of a double star.

The first serious theoretical description of novas and supernovas was presented in the early 1950 's by Hoyle and associates. This theory is still being modified and expanded. Nova and supernova occur due to the explosion of both single and double stars. The remnant of Tycho Brahe's supernova was rediscovered in 1952 by use of the recently invented radiotelescope, but could not be shown to be due to a double star explosion until it was extensively mapped by the orbiting Einstein X-ray observatory in 1967.

### Crab Nebula

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that there is a lone star at the centre of the Crab Nebula which is the mother sphere, and had its origin in a nova explosion occurring 900 years ago. The existence of a mother sphere for this nebula was demonstrated in 1967 with the detection of a pulsar now known to be a neutron star.

### What Makes Stars Shine

The URANTIA Paper commenting on this subject was received in 1934. It states that the most common source of energy generated in the stars comes from the hydrogen-carbon-helium reaction in which carbon is the catalyst for the conversion of hydrogen to helium.

The theory proposing that energy can be generated in this way was worked out independently by Hans Bethe and von Weizsacker in 1938, and published by Bethe in 1939, and now is accepted theory.

### Age Of The Solar System

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that the events triggering the formation of the solar system occurred 4.5 billion years ago. Up to the 1950's, and based on the work of Edwin Hubble, the generally accepted age of the universe was just 2 billion years. Then Baade's work at Mt. Wilson revealed an error in Hubble's methodology effectively doubling the age of the universe, and causing great hilarity in the American press in the 1950 's. Most astronomers now put the age of the universe at about 15-18 billion years, and radio-isotope dating of meteoric material puts the age of the solar system at about 4.6 billion years, which is virtually the same age as told by _The URANTIA Book_.

### Black Holes And Neutron Stars

A thimblefull of matter from a neutron star would weigh about 100 million tons. For a black hole, the weight would be infinitely greater. It is not surprising that astronomers regarded such objects as the play toys of theoretical physicists. Then, in the mid 1960's, the discovery of pulsars and quasars completely changed the picture. The name black holes was coined in 1968. Prior to that, these theoretical objects were simply known as dark bodies from which light could not escape. Current theory has it that the source of novas and supernovas is the gravitational collapse of spent stars. For stars near the mass of our sun the final result is the formation of a white dwarf. For stars more than about 5 times the mass of the sun, the result is a neutron star. For stars 25 times the mass of the sun, the result is a black hole. In the final blast initiating neutron star formation, vast quantities of tiny uncharged particles, the neutrinos, are released.

The formation of a neutron star is clearly being described in _The URANTIA Book_ ([UB 42:4.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/42#p4_11)) where it is stated that the gravity collapse of massive stars is accompanied by release of vast numbers of tiny uncharged particles. Such particles are not released in the formation of white dwarfs or black holes. The existence of these particles (the neutrinos) was not demonstrated until 1956. The first identification of a neutron star was made in 1967.

_The URANTIA Book_ ([UB 15:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/15#p6_11)) also tells us that some “dark islands of space” are the remains of dead suns, devoid of light and heat, and that their density is “well nigh unbelievable”. This is a description of a black hole. There are many references to black holes in _The URANTIA Book_ as these are used by the Power Directors to ensure gravitational stability of many different systems and in the control of energy flow. In one interesting reference concerning the formation of our solar system, the Book ([UB 57:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/57#p5_4)) describes the centre of the Angona system as a “dark giant of space, solid, highly charged, and possessing enormous gravity pull”, clearly a ‘charged’ black hole. The theory of charged black holes was developed in the 1960's by Kerr and Newman. The concept of highly charged black holes ( 10 to 20 th volts) has recently come of age in attempts to account for the power output of quasars. (see Scientific American reference)

### Dinosaurs

_The URANTIA Book_ states that the remains of the largest monster dinosaur are buried in North America, Europe, Africa, and India, but not Australia. Although dinosaur fossils have been found in Australia, to date (1988), no monster dinosaur fossils have yet been found.

### Marsupials

The January issue of Scientific American (1985) p. 60 discusses whether marsupials originated in Australia and radiated via Antartica to the Americas, thence Europe or the reverse. It is stated that the marsupials flourished about 50 million years ago, and comments that proponents of continental drift think that Australia was connected to South America about that time. _The URANTIA Book_ tells us that the ancestors of the kangaroos roamed Australia 45 million years ago, and that 35 million years ago the southern land bridge was extensive, reconnecting the then enormous Antartic continent with South America, South Africa and Australia.

Recently marsupial fossils have been found on Seymour Island in Antartica. None of this is too surprising in 1988, but remember that when _The URANTIA Book_ was published, virtually nobody believed in the concept of continental drift.

### The Red Man To The Americas


_The URANTIA Book_ tells us that the red man crossed from Asia to America 85,000 years ago. Until recently, most anthropologists believed that the Americas had been inhabited by humans for no more than 12,000 years. This date has been pushed back to 30-40,000 years.

### Addendum: Continental Drift And Land Elevation

_The URANTIA Book_ account of the geological history of our planet tells us that following the breakup of the supercontinent about 700 million years ago, there have been repeated cycles of land elevation and submergence. Between approximately 400 and 200 million years ago, the periodicity appears to average very roughly 25 million years, with periods of much more frequent cycling during the Carboniferous and Cretaceous periods.

Changes in sea level have often been attributed to advance and retreat of the polar ice caps, but this would not appear to account for the movements described in _The URANTIA Book_. More recently a mechanism has been proposed involving the accumulation of heat beneath the great land masses that is thought to cause the elevation, doming, and breakup of continents, and their subsequent rejoining. Although the concept has been put forward dominantly to account for transverse movement, it also provides a physical mechanism that could explain the vertical movement described in _The URANTIA Book_ account.

The mechanism proposed indicates a relatively slow build up of heat, but the subsequent blow off can occur in a number of ways, hence considerable deviation from sine wave periodicity would be expected. This new theory will be of interest to URANTIA Book readers who have been puzzled by its account of the alternate elevation and depression of continents on such a large scale. (the million year cycles referred to on p. 691 may refer only to the Cretaceous. There were up to 75 inundations during the Carboniferous. Alternatively, it may be a transcriptional error)

## Look To The Light

No deep darkness in the world 
Can overcome the light;
A single candle flame will burn 
Against the darkest night.

Let all the world of darkness come 
Resentments, envies, fears,
Then light the single flame of love 
The darkness disappears!
