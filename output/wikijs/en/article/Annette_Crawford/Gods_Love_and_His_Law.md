_Study Group Notes Assembled by Annette Crawford, Deinver, Colorado._

> Ed. Note: _Mercy ministry, the divine way of raising us children in a reality which consists of both law and love is. the very thing that makes our evolutionary, experiential, ascending lives possible. This study affords an opportunity to contemplate the awesome complexity of our experience of relativity in a universe whose foundation is absolute perfection and whose destiny is finality as individuals, supremacy as total evolutionary completion, and ultimacy of divine fruition._
> 
> This study presents a truly beautiful glimpse of the landscape of mercy ministry and immutable divine law.

> “Justice is the collective thought of righteousness; mercy is its personal expression. Mercy is the attitude of love; precision characterizes the operation of law; divine judgement is the soul of fairness, ever conforming to the justice of the Trinity, ever fulfilling the divine love of God. When fully perceived and completely understood, the righteous justice of the Trinity and the merciful love of the Universal Father are coincident. But man has no such full understanding of divine justice. Thus in the Trinity, as man would view it, the personalities of Father, Son, and Spirit are adjusted to co-ordinate ministry of love and law in the experiential universes of time.” [UB 10:6.18](/en/The_Urantia_Book/10#p6_18)
