Each individual is a microcosm of all aspects of God,[^1] from the Father to the Absolute. Each moment has infinity at its core. In the process of actualizing the potential of each moment all aspects of God take part. For us to utilize our potential to its greatest good we must understand, nourish, and submit to all representatives of God in us in every moment, in every action, and in every thought.

The initial polarization of the Infinite into the Father and the Son, or the concept and the Word, produced a tension, a charge, caused by the space between the two polar points which both individualized and united the poles. “The Infinite Spirit became the conjoint administrator of the Father and the Son for the execution of their united and eternal purpose.” ([UB 8:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p3_5)) The Second Source and Center is the focalization of the pattern [^2] and the Third Source and Center is the application of the pattern, the natural result of its focalization. [^3]

I do not address either the physical or the social realms of gender, only the unity of the individual soul. Two vital elements of the psyche are the _animus_ and the _anima_. Carl Jung used these terms to designate the male within and the female within respectively.

The _anima_'s proper positive role is “as mediator between the ego and the self,” (_Man and His Symbols_, C. Jung) The ego being the conscious focalization of the self, and the self being the totality of the individual (the evolving soul). Therefore, the female within is the psychic counterpart of the Conjoint Actor ([UB 8:4.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/8#p4_2)). The growth of this aspect is in four steps. The first is biological - unadorned, “virgin”, physical perfection, as are _Gaugin's Island Women_, which produces basic physical desire. The second step is idealized, romantic beauty as _Helen of Troy_, whose face “launched a thousand ships”. The third step can be represented by the Catholic concept of the _Virgin Mary_, who has become the mediator to the higher spiritual powers. She symbolizes spiritual eros (feeling). The fourth step is wisdom as personified by the _Mona Lisa_ or _Athena_; or as the evolving soul, as is _Shekhina_ of the _Kabbalah_; or, perhaps, as Deity Absolute is to the First Source and Center. [^4]

Through time, the mind has personified its various aspects into gods and goddesses, heroes and heroines. Female gods all have one thing in common. They give, they dispense. Pandora gives the ills of the world. The mythical Eve gives “original sin”. The idealized Mary gives guidance to the saints. Venus gives love, Athena gives wisdom, Gaia gives life.

Male gods are patterns. Eros is love. Cronus is time. Vulcan is the “fallen”, the imperfect. Zeus is supremacy.

The Eternal Son is the focalization of Infinate Personality into Absolute personality. He is the spiritual pattern. “The Eternal Son is the spiritual personalization of the Paradise Father's universal and infinite concept of divine reality”. (P.73.3) At the moment of this focalization, Paradise was formed. It is the material pattern.

In our psyche, according to Jung, the _animus_ represents the male within, “... the positive side of the animus can personify an enterprising spirit, courage, truthfulness, and in the highest form, spiritual profundity.” (_Man and His Symbols_, C.Jung) It takes the form of sacred convictions. It is the core of an individual that focalizes into a “truth” to which the individual aspires. It's the pattern (Second Source and Center) of the forming soul that is applied to the individual's physical existence by the process determined by the anima (Third Source and Center) and in the environment of the individual's personality (First Source and Center). Christ is a role model for the balanced soul. He is our “Word” of the Father's “concept”. ([UB 182:1.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/182#p1_9)) To follow his lead, to continue the pattern he set, we, therefore, must emulate the highest beauty we know, taking that as our pattern. When Christ speaks to an individual he doesn't force his pattern on that person or belitthe that person for not understanding. He gives to that person what that person's potential is ripe for. He gives away based on the individual's need. Christ's male aspect (truth) and female aspect (application) are balanced. “Jesus of Nazareth achieved the knowing and doing of the will of God.” ([UB 196:1.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p1_1))

## Notes

[^1]: This means God as he applies himself to evolutionary reality. Obviously the Father, Son, and Spirit are reflected as personality, spirit and mind. Likewise the Ancients of Days, the Master Spirits, and the Supreme can be reflected as administration (taking control of one's destiny), morality, and brotherhood. We desire to recreate as does the Local Universe Greator Son (both racially and artistically). The three Absolutes are our untapped potential, our ideal, and the vast area between.

[UB 180:2.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/180#p2_1) “I am the Vine, and you are the Branches.”
