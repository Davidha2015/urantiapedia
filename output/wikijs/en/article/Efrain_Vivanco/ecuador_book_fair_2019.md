This year’s book fair in Ecuador was held at the Puce Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador from 3—7 June. Although we are not yet officially recognized as the National Association of Urantia Book Readers of Ecuador (AUEC), this year we participated in the Puce Fair as AUEC.

We were located at booth number 17, which we arranged with posters alluding to _The Urantia Book_ and graphics of the Master Universe. We were joined by a collaboration of Urantia Book students from the Readers Group of the Garden of Edentia, the Valley of the Chillos, and the city of Quito.

This is a small six-day fair, attended mainly by students and teachers; there is not a large audience, but the quality of the attendees is of a high educational level.

Only four books were sold; but we distributed 1,000 copies of the three-side folder with information on the contents of _The Urantia Book_. Most students interested in the themes of the book said they intend to search the book on the Internet.

On Monday, June 3 at 5:00 p.m., we gave an informative lecture about _The Urantia Book_ that was attended by about 20 people.

A copy of _The Urantia Book_ was delivered to the College of Philosophy and Theology of the Pontifical Catholic University of Ecuador (PUCE).

Finally, considering that the purpose of this fair is not to sell books but rather to make the book known to other people, we believe that we accomplished our goal.
