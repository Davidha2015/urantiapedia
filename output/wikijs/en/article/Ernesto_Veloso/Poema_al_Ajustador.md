<p style="text-align">
Shard of the Divine <br>
It's you, my adjuster, <br>
Faithful Guide, Shaper<br>
Of my future destiny<br>
With you I forge the way<br>
I put feet to my mind<br>
If I cross the bridge with you<br>
To the spirit realm<br>
It's not me, it's your masterful<br>
Quiet and patient labor<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align">
Your name is efficiency<br>
Though I don't always perceive<br>
Your voice from which I receive<br>
The faith for my existence<br>
But if ineffable experience<br>
Of joy, peace and love<br>
Reflex when the pain<br>
He visits me inopportunely<br>
Is that with you I am one<br>
That has defeated the pain<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align">
If I disappoint for a while<br>
Your spiritual labor<br>
It's my animal tendency<br>
That I still don't abandon <br>
And, if at times I'm out of tune<br>
Notes of disharmony<br>
And I wander between apathy<br>
Of fear and confusion<br>
I throw the father a prayer<br>
And you brighten my day<br>
</p>

<p style="text-align">
Though I don't always perceive<br>
Your voice from which I receive<br>
The faith for my existence<br>
But, if ineffable experience<br>
Of joy, peace and love<br>
Reflex when the pain<br>
He visits me inopportunely<br>
Is that with you I am one<br>
Who has defeated fear<br>
