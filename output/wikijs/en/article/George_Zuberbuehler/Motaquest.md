<p class="v-card v-sheet theme--light gray lighten-3 px-2">© 1993 George Zuberbuehler<br>© 1993 The Fellowship for readers of The Urantia Book</p>

_Prepared by George Zuberbuehler, White Haven, Pennsylvania_

The purpose of this study is to enhance our understanding and appreciation of each of the 28 statements of human philosophy utilized by the morontia instructor on the first mansion world in a lesson on [UB 48:7.1-2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_1).

Mota is morontia wisdom ([UB 45:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/45#p7_6)). This study is a pursuit of that wisdom contained in the mortal philosophy of this lesson through references to these concepts found in _The Urantia Book_.

> ED NOTE: _This study was presented at a fall, 1992 meeting of the Connecticut Fellowship, for readers of_ _The Urantia Book_.
