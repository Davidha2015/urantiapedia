My latest study aid, _Soul Evolution: Deeper Delvings into Divinity_, is a more visual representation of concepts from _The Urantia Book_ which give us a clearer idea of what it takes to transform ourselves and attain self-mastery. How to co-create our souls together with our Thought Adjuster and become more Godlike. God has given us all we need to do this, but we have to develop the courage to explore these unknown realms. We need persistent effort to make this shift of consciousness. We must commit to letting go of old ways of behaving and thinking to see the world and other people in new ways. We are transferring our souls to new vehicles and gaining a cosmic perspective and an eternal purpose. It takes eternity to become perfect, but we can begin that divine process now. One of the main purposes of _The Urantia Book_ is the salvation of human souls.

This study aid is a summary of many concepts in the book which concern our spiritual progress while on this planet. We often get imprisoned in our self-imposed limitations—stuck in the mire of our prejudices, inertia, and old habits. Most people are happy to live within the limits of their comfort zones. Spiritual progress requires courage, commitment, intent, perseverance, and sincerity plus a huge investment in faith. The goal is one worth working towards—eternal life with God as our partner.  

Some of the contents include God’s Divine Plan, Personality, Mind, Belief and Faith, God-Seeking Decisions, Free Will, Morality, Adjuster Harmony and much much more. It is available on Amazon and all proceeds go to Urantia charities.

> Few mortals ever dare to draw anything like the sum of personality credits established by the combined ministries of nature and grace. The majority of impoverished souls are truly rich, but they refuse to believe it. [[UB 48:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p7_6)]   

Enjoy! Hara Davis
