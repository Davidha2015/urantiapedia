FRIENDSHIP is a relationship existing in many gradations. If it is a high grade, it is a great human value. It may even be interspersed with brotherly feelings.

BROTHERHOOD is based on the recognition of having the same Father, and enjoying the unity of willingness to do His will. It often is intermingled with the feeling of friendship.

SONSHIP can only be sonship WITH God. It is therefore primarily a personal relationship between man and God. But this relationship changes man fundamentally and increasingly. And spontaneously it bears the fruits of friendship and brotherhood.

Sonship with God is therefore that relationship and quality that should be sought for, and striven for in the first place. What is the difference between sonship and brotherhood? It is the fact that the personal relationship with the Father dominates. It differs from being a child of the Father in the measure of growth. A child is a potential son, but not yet an actual son.

What determines this growth? The son knows his Father in a different way than when he was a child. There is more understanding of his Father. The son grows in insight. He begins to realize that he has an infinite Father, infinitely rich, and this Father declared in Jesus' parable of the prodigal son: “All I have is yours”. Only it is a universe law that all progress is predicated on effort. The Father in his wisdom has planned it this way. ([UB 115:7.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p7_2))

He knows too well that gifts for nothing are often not too much appreciated. Remember how few persons of the many who were healed in the miraculous sundown healing entered the kingdom. Only what we sincerely have earned through effort we truly enjoy. Even the Eternal Son had to search the deep thought of the Father to become the Word, the expression of that thought.

The sure and effective way to establish brotherhood and friendship is turning to sonship with God. It is what Jesus did. When he wanted to help his apostles in the most effective way he turned to his Father in prayer, and though his attitude toward his Father was that of a child, his prayer was the positive prayer of an understanding Son.

So let us strive for understanding. The universe (and _The URANTIA Book_) swarm with clues, while the great teacher, the Adjuster, is always with us and delights in helping us on, though he is dependent on our willingness, our right attitude, our effort, and our perseverance. But then all things needful will be added to the kingdom, brotherhood and friendship too.
