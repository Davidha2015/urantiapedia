## Urantia 2000 IUA Conference

**LIVING THE WILL OF OUR FATHER**
**New York, USA**
**August 4-7, 2000**

The United States Urantia Association is hosting the International Conference at Wagner College on Staten Island in New York August 3-7. The United States Urantia Association cordially invites the entire _Urantia Book_ readership to celebrate, worship and commune with our Paradise Father as we join in sharing our spiritual lives and personal experiences with the Spirit Fragment of our Father that indwells us all. For three and one-half days this conference will be devoted and dedicated wholly to Our Universal Father and Living His Will. Here, participants will explore and discover many ways, means and methods that may be employed for personally seeking, finding, and actually doing the Father's will in our daily lives. The Adjuster will be the focus of this conference, just as it was with Jesus as he demonstrated his wonderful life in the flesh and as he lived the will of our Father.

With the insight gained from the revelators of _The Urantia Book_, the conference participants may explore the many manners used by the Master, suggested by the Divine Counselor and related by the Solitary Messenger to know God's will, choose it, and actually do it as a conscious part of living. The conference program is designed to provide the participant with the exciting Spiritual Experience of Living the Will of Our Father, a step toward Light and Life and eventual fusion. Again, the emphasis here is on the word **LIVING** the Father's will. Speakers and workshop leaders hail from all over the world. A special children's program is planned.

**CONFERENCE FEES**: The cost of the conference including housing, a variety of delicious meals, and conference materials is 375.00$. Children will enjoy a reduced price. If you wish to extend your stay, you will pay an additional fee. Registration materials are now available. You may find out more information and register by contacting: Urantia 2000 IUA Conference, 67-86 Groton Street, Forest Hills, NY 11375-4160 USA.

# General Assembly of the Urantia Association of Colombia (UAC) 

ANDRÉs RODRIGUEZ, COLOMBIA

$\square$n April 15, 2000, the General Assembly of the members of the Urantia Association of Colombia met, as they do each year according to their charter. Present were 30 of the 56 registered members, who met in an atmosphere of enthusiasm and spirituality to elect a president and secretary.

Elected as president was Patricia Ramirez, a bacteriologist and microbiologist who has studied _The Urantia Book_ for many years and who spoke of her program of work for disseminating the fifth epochal revelation in Colombia with enthusiasm and energy. The vote for secretary fell to Max Carrizo, artist and craftsman, who in spite of his having studied _The Urantia Book_ only for a while, has nonetheless achieved a high level of understanding due to his biblical and philosophical knowledge. Moreover, some of the chairmen of committees were changed in order to refresh the association with new ideas: Irma Ortiz on the membership committee, Wilfredo Ortiz on the education committee, and Aurora Ruiz on the conference committee. Continuing for one more year are Joaquin Sandoval as vice president and Ricardo Ortiz as treasurer.

We use this opportunity to congratulate and thank Carlos Zapata and Maria Consuelo Garavito for their dauntless service of working with the association for the last two years as president and secretary, respectively. They had to work very hard and dedicate quite a lot of time to fulfill the mission, many times at the cost of neglecting their familial and professional duties. Carlos Zapata will continue to guide us, serving as the new chairman of the publications committee. Good luck to the new leaders, and may the Celestial Supervisors help them and their Thought Adjusters guide them!




## URANTIA BOOK INTERNET $\mathrm{SCHOOL}$ 
 A Call For Teacher/Facilitators

The Urantia Book Internet School will complete its first year on June 11. Twelve courses were presented, and English readers from many countries participated in these studies. The course topics were selected by the Teacher/Facilitators, and the course format was eightweeks, divided into four periods of questions, study, responses and discussion. Worthy of mention is the high number of new readers and youthful readers that enrolled in the courses. One of the most enjoyable and satisfying outcomes of each course was the connection and interaction of these groups of students from near and far, and the enthusiasm of new and long-time readers alike.

Plans for next year are now being made, and this is a call for readers to offer their service as Teacher/ Facilitators. The UBIS needs your help. We need experienced readers who have available time (and internet skills) to come forward and join us in this project. You will receive lots of support, example course formats, technical assistance from web master Jay Peregrine, and any help you may wish along the way to prepare your course. We would like to have the Fall Semester organized by July 1 .

If you are interested in serving as a Teacher/ Facilitator for the Fall Semester, which will begin on September 11, please contact Dorothy Elder at [delder03@sprynet.com](mailto:delder03@sprynet.com) We look forward to hearing from you.

In friendship, Dorothy Elder

## WHAT IS LOYALTY?

Thoughts on the 50th Anniversary of Urantia Foundation, March 17, 2000

## CATHY JONES

Loving the Father with all your heart, soul and mind. Obeying the voice within.

Yielding not to impatience, while remaining true to principle.

Always asking for strength of character. Leading others by example.

Team work! Respecting the rights and ideas of others. Yes! To the call to service to your fellow man.
