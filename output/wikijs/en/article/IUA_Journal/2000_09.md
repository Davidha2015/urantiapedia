## Special Conference Issue

This issue presents most of the discourses presented at the IUA International Conference, which was held at Wagner College in New York City on August 4-7, 2000.

Several of the discourses were not available at press time. They will be printed in later issues of the Journal as they become available.

Printed copies of many of these speeches were handed out at the conference. All of these texts have been edited somewhat for correctness, clarity, and consistent referencing of quotes from _The Urantia Book_.

## International Conference Highlights "Living the Will of the Father"

August 4-7, 2000 New York City, USA

Three hundred and fifteen people from 23 countries attended the International Urantia Association's biennial conference held August 4 through 7 at Wagner College on Staten Island, just across the bay from New York City. This included 41 children ages 7 to 18 who came to share in the experience. The Urantia Association of Greater New York (UAGNY) and the Urantia Association of New England (UANE) co-sponsored the conference. Urantia Conference 2000 was in fact an international conference. There were representatives from around the world, including France, Finland, Bolivia, Australia, Senegal, Peru, Mexico, Chile, Greece, Argentina, The Netherlands, Cuba, and the United Kingdom-to mention a few.

The theme of the conference was "Living the Will of Our Father." Eighteen speakers from around the world presented discourses on various perspectives of this theme. Some of the discourses were presented in more than one language. Written translations were also available for many of the discourses. In the later afternoons, participants could choose from a variety of workshops, giving them an opportunity to exchange ideas in a less formal setting.

The children were invited to attend the opening session and were presented with their own copies of _The Urantia Book_. Later the children attended workshops designed especially for them. Their program included a trip to Manhattan with adult chaperones.

To some extent, the success of this type of conference can be measured by the diversity of the group attending, diversity, not only of nationality, but ethnicity, age and socio-economic group and other categories as well. As was illustrated in one of the presentations, the vast majority of those attending were in the "over 45 " category. But there was a larger than usual number of young people in attendance. They helped with the children, attended workshops, performed, and otherwise participated in conference activities. It was great to see them there. These young people are the future of the movement and of the planet. We need their perspectives and their energy.

No conference is complete without the arts. At this conference, they were abundant and diverse. Carlos Rubinsky of Argentina displayed some of his paintings representing the sacred geometry. Alfons Halsema from the Netherlands led beautiful choir music and Urs Ruchti of France presented an excellent piano recital. The "Little Savages Ensemble" lightened the days with musical interludes. Bert Cobb of the United States read some of his poetry, and Chris Wood wrote a play that was performed by many of the under-25 participants. There was also theater, poetry, dance, and lots of other music by various performers. On Monday morning Helen Anvelt of Estonia presented an artful tapestry of words, music and dance. This worshipful presentation of truth, beauty and goodness brought tears of joy to many.

Conferences are always a great place to renew old friendships and make new ones. The firsttime conference attendee is often overwhelmed with joy to finally meet so many other readers. The seasoned attendee is refreshed to see the progress and growth of the circle of readers. The New York conference provided a wonderful venue for the meeting of mind and spirit.

## Living in accordance with the Will of Our Father — Passages from The Urantla Book, read by Various Speakers

THIS IS THE MESSAGE AND THE QUOTES FROM THE URANTIA BOOK THAT OPENED THE CONFERENCE IN NEW YORK.

**THE WILL OF GOD IS HERE!**

The Mystery of His Spirit Indwelling Has Been Revealed!

We Proclaim this Day as the Beginning of Our Return to the High Spiritual Concept of the Will of Our Heavenly Father Dominant and Transcendent in the Hearts, Minds and Souls of Mankind!

> _The human Jesus saw God as being holy, just, and great, as well as being true, beautiful, and good. All these attributes of divinity be focused in bis mind as the “will of the Father in heaven.” Jesus' God was at one and the same time “The Holy One of Israel” and “The living and loving Father in heaven.” The concept of God as a Father was not original with Jesus, but be exalted and elevated the idea into a sublime experience by achieving a new revelation of God and by proclaiming that every mortal creature is a child of this Father of love, a son of God._ [[UB 196:0.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p0_2)]

> _“The Lord our God is one Lord, and you should love him with all your mind and heart while you do your very best to love all bis children as you love yourself. This one God is our heavenly Father, in whom all things consist, and who dwells, by bis spirit, in every sincere human soul. And we who are the children of God should learn how to commit the keeping of our souls to him as to a faithful Creator. With our heavenly Father all things are possible. Since be is the Creator, having made all things and all beings, it could not be otherwise. Though we cannot see God, we can know him. And by daily living the will of the Father in heaven, we can reveal him to our fellow men.”_ [[UB 131:10.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/131#p10_2)]

> _Sooner or later all universe personalities begin to realize that the final quest of eternity is the endless exploration of infinity, the never-ending voyage of discovery into the absoluteness of the First Source and Center. Sooner or later we all become aware that all creature growth is proportional to Father identification. We arrive at the understanding that living the will of God is the eternal passport to the endless possibility of infinity itself. Mortals will sometime realize that success in the quest of the Infinite is directly proportional to the acbievement of Fatber likeness, and that in this universe age the realities of the Father are revealed within the qualities of divinity. And these qualities of divinity are personally appropriated by universe creatures in the experience of living divinely, and to live divinely means actually to live the will of God._ [[UB 106:9.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p9_11)]

> _To material, evolutionary, finite creatures, a life predicated on the living of the Father's will leads directly to the attainment of spirit supremacy in the personality arena and brings such creatures one step nearer the comprebension of the Father-Infinite. Such a Father life is one predicated on truth, sensitive to beauty, and dominated by goodness. Such a God-knowing person is inwardly illuminated by worship and outwardly devoted to the wholehearted service of the universal brotherbood of all personalities, a service ministry which is filled with merry and motivated by love, while all these life qualities are unified in the evolving personality on ever-ascending levels of cosmic wisdom, self-realization, God-finding, and Father worship._ [[UB 106:9.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/106#p9_12)]

> _Every mortal who is consciously or unconsciously following the leading of his indwelling Adjuster is living in accordance with the will of God. Consciousness of Adjuster presence is consciousness of God's presence._ [[UB 107:0.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_4)]
