On Friday the 21st of August, 2015 the Netherlands Urantia Association (UAISUN) organized the eighth Annual Urantia Day. After commemorating the birth of Jesus of Nazareth, the day was devoted to study and becoming acquainted with new readers and renewing old friendships.

As last year, the Annual Meeting Day took place at Groot Kievitsdal, a conference center and restaurant beautifully located in the woods of the Estate Pijnenburg in Hilversum.

As usual there were a good number of attendees with 46 readers of _The Urantia Book_ from The Netherlands and Belgian Flanders.

Three presenters discussed the following subjects:

1. Morontia on Urantia
2. The School known as Urantia
3. The Artisans of Morontia

After each introduction with a PowerPoint presentation of about 20 minutes there was time to discuss the subject in groups of 7-8 people for 15 minutes. The questions that arose from those discussions at each roundtable were then posed to the presenter who had 15 minutes to answer the questions. In between those three sessions there was time for coffee, lunch, and drinks afterwards.

This new approach was different from the previous annual meetings. The result was a better comprehension of the subjects and a profound interaction between participants.

With great pleasure we can look back on a very successful day!
