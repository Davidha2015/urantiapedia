By Janet Farrington

Wooden fence and winding water 
rustic house and barn
animals with poung first walking
peaceful country farm.

Horses run and birds fly bursting
from the alder trees,
bales of hay and grass rolled neatly
bulge from under eaves.

Highland fields rise smoorh and gentle
merging into woods,
bordered by majestic mountains
formed before man stood.

Landscape colors painted freely
blend with morning light,
traveling through a quiet valley
beauty stirs delight.

Vistas banish any trouble
mind before did hold,
surrounded by inspiring scenes
endless dreams unfold.

Beauty transcends normal vision
 human finds divine
flowing tree befween dimensions 
blurring nature's line.

Periection paints amazing grace 
brushing rocks with truth 
upon the canvas nature wears 
beaury offers proof.

Divinity embraces all 
world and mind converge,
every tree and peak and eagle 
help a soul emerge.

An atmosphere of partnership, 
loving soul and land, 
beauty speaks a living language 
all can understand.

Rolling hills and rising mountains, 
nature reaches deep, 
within the soul perfection knows 
beauty shared will keep.
