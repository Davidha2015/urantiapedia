The Belgium-Francophone Urantia Association (ABFU) was charted as a Local Association of Urantia Association International in 2006. For 40 years, study groups were initiated mainly by one man: François Dupont. As of 2006, the groups were gradually overseen by the new President, Jean Annet.

We organize study groups in different cities, participate in expos and fairs, and give lectures in both public and private places so that hundreds of people may hear about _The Urantia Book_ in French-speaking Belgium.

Every year we organize, a national meeting on Jesus’ birthday where between 20 and 30 people attend. We also organize study days with Georges and Marlène Michelson-Dupont from France. We have a roster of about 100 people, of whom one third are members of our association, while another third are actively involved in activities such as study groups, conferences, and study days. The remaining participants follow our activities closely or remotely.

Since COVID, activities have been reorganized in other ways, mainly through Zoom meetings. Agnès Lazar and Guy Perron host several national and international study groups and present webinars in both French and English, as well as conducting courses at the Urantia Book Internet School. Jean Annet continues his study groups via the internet; the last meeting brought together about twenty people.

We shall continue to do whatever we can to foster the study of _The Urantia Book_ and to disseminate its teaching in French-speaking Belgium.
