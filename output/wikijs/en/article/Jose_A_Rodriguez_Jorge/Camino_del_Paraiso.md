<p style="text-align:center;">
I go by your hand<br>
Road to Paradise<br>
Even though my stepsq<br>
Continue on earth;<br>
Happy, smiling<br>
I turn to you<br>
my father<br>
With great effort<br>
True to my destiny<br>
Guided by your light<br>
In which I,<br>
Despite the darkness,<br>
Do not doubt, but I trust
<p>
