Meanwhile utopia arrives
Walking I listen to hope
Planting the flowers of the day
Although tears come to our eyes.

Singing fixes remedies
And I contain the sadness
Whistling in the silence
And the thought full of oddities.

A long time ago or a little while ago
We don't know what to think
The sea shakes us like crazy
When all that remains is to pray.

Meanwhile the actions
Looking for a haven of peace
Avoiding the cyclones
There is a divine source over here.

They will arrive
When it's our turn to rest
Where did the dreams go?
And be your awakening.
