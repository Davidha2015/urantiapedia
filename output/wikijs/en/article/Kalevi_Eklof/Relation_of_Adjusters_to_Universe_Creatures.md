Kalevi Eklöf, Finland

We have in Finland an old adage that goes: “A beloved child has many names,” and in my reading _The Urantia Book_ this saying very often crosses my mind, particularly where the discussion concerns the Thought Adjusters. We are familiat with appellations like Thought Adjuster, Mystery Monitor, Thought Changer, Thought Controller and many others. All of these denotations depict, tell about or express some of the many methods, ways or forms of acting that the Thought Adjusters make use of and apply.

The book tells us:

> _. . . there are the impersonal Mystery Monitors, Thought Adjusters, the actual gift of the great God himself sent to indwell such as the humans of Urantia, sent without announcement and without explanation. In endless profusion they descend from the beigbts of glory to grace and indwell the humble minds of thase mortals who possess the capacity for God-consciousness or the potential therfor._ [[UB 2:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/2#p1_7)]


In accordance with the three general developmental stages of man, the Monitors are given the following designations:

> _From the arrival of the Adjuster to comparative full growth, about twenty years of age on Urantia, the Monitors are sometimes designated Thought Changers. From this time to the attainment of the age of discretion, about forty years, the Mystery Monitors are called Thought Adjusters. From the attainment of discretion to deliverance from the flesh, they are often referred to as Thought Controllers._ [[UB 107:0.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/107#p0_7)]

The Adjusters can be classified also in accordance with the experience that they have gained, as virgin that is, those without experience in mortal indwelling advanced and supreme. Apart from that, we are told about self-acting Adjusters, divided in accordance with six different criteria ([UB 109:2.1-8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p2_1)). This classification is functional, and reflects the various service experiences that the Adjuster has gained in his ministry, but it reflects also the eternity decisions that his mortal subjects have made, or the mortal subject's membership in the reserve corps of destiny in his world, or the mortal subjects having acted as the material complement to a spirit personality intrusted with some cosmic achievement, orse the Adjuster's having participated in extrahuman service associated with the spiritual administration of the world of assignment.

We may read the following statements concerning personality and its relationship with experience, evolution, and the Thought Adjuster:

> _Personality is a level of deified reality and ranges from the mortal and midwayer level of the higher mind activation of worship and returns to Divinington, an extended course of training is engaged in. This additional training is made possible by the experience of having indwelt a human being, and it is always imparted before the Adjuster is remanded to the evolutionary worlds of time._ [[UB 109:1.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p1_2)]

There is one interesting point to make: Even if the Adjusters communicate with other beings and are conscious of and able to utilise for example the news gathering and promulgation organisation of reflectivity of all creation, the information stored in Adjusters is nonetheless safe.

The knowledge and plans of the Father fragments are not reflectible. The Discerners of Spirits can and do reflect the presence of the Adjusters but they cannot decipher the content of the mindedness of the Mystery Monitors ([UB 28:5.22](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p5_22)).

We Urantians live our evolutionary and experiential lives on this decimal planet, and it is of utmost importance to realise the significance of multifarious experience within the whole of existence.

> _Actual living experience has no cosmic substitute. The perfection of the divinity of a newly formed Thought Adjuster does not in any manner endow this Mystery Monitor with experienced ministrative ability. Experience is inseparable from a living existence; it is the one thing which no amount of divine endowment can absolve you from the necessity of securing by actual living Therefore, in common with all beings living and functioning within the present spbere of the Supreme, Thought Adjusters must acquire experience; they must evolve from the lower, inexperienced, to the higher, more experienced groups._ [[UB 109:1.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p1_3)]

> _Adjusters pass through a definite developmental career in the mortal mind; they achieve a reality of attainment which is eternally theirs. They progressively acquire Adjuster skill and ability as a result of any and all contacts with the material races, regardless of the survival or nonsurvival of their particular mortal subjects. They are also equal partners of the human mind in fostering the evolution of the immortal soul of survival capacity._ [[UB 109:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p1_4)]

> _The first stage of Adjuster evolution is attained in fusion with the surviving soul of a mortal being. Thus, while you are in nature evolving inward and upward from man to God, the Adjusters are in nature evolving outward and downward from God to man; and so will the final product of this union of divinity and humanity be the son of man and the son of God._ [[UB 109:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p1_5)]

Apart from what has been stated above, we may read about the Adjuster that indwelt Jesus' human mind, and about his other ministries, as well as about the indestructibility of true values:

> _The activities of Adjusters in your local universe are directed by the Personalized Adjuster of Michael of Nebadon, that very Monitor who guided him step by step when be lived bis human life in the flesh of Joshua ben Joseph. Faithful to his trust was this extraordinary Adjuster, and wisely did this valiant Monitor direct the human nature, ever guiding the mortal mind of the Paradise Son in the choosing of the path of the Father's perfect will. This Adjuster had previously served with Machiventa Melcbizedek in the days of Abrabam and had engaged in tremendous exploits both previous to this indwelling and between these bestowal experiences._ [[UB 109:6.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_4)]

> _This Adjuster did indeed triumph in Jesus' human mind —that mind which in each of life's recurring situations maintained a consecrated dedication to the Father's will, saying, “Not my will, but yours, be done.” Such decisive consecration constitutes the true passport from the limitations of human nature to the finality of divine attainment._ [[UB 109:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_5)]

> _This same Adjuster now reflects in the inscrutable nature of his mighty personality the prebaptismal humanity of Joshua ben Joseph, the eternal and living transcript of the eternal and living values which the greatest of all Urantians created out of the humble circumstances of a commonplace life as it was lived to the complete exhaustion of the spiritual values attainable in mortal experience._ [[UB 109:6.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_6)]

> _Everything of permanent value which is intrusted to an Adjuster is assured eternal survival. In certain instances the Monitor holds these possessions for bestowal on a mortal mind of future indwelling; in others, and upon personalization, these surviving and conserved realities are beld in trust for future utilization in the service of the Architects of the Master Universe._ [[UB 109:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_7)]

As concems spiritually significant changes in superconsciousness which result from the Adjuster indwelling and as concerns the possibilities imbedded in human imagination and sleep we are revealed this:

> _Supreme and self-acting Adjusters are often able to contribute factors of spiritual import to the human mind when it flows freely in the liberated by controlled channels of creative imagination. At such times, and sometimes during sleep, the Adjuster is able to arrest the mental currents, to stay theylow, and then to divert the idea procession; and all this is done in order to effect deep spiritual transformations in the higher recesses of the superconsciousness. Thus are the forces and energies of mind more fully adjusted to the key of the contactual tones of the spiritual level of the present and the future._ [[UB 109:5.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_1)]

> _It is sometimes possible to bave the mind illuminated, to bear the divine voice that continually speaks within you, so that you may become partially conscious of the wisdom, truth, goodness, and beauty of the potential personality constantly indwelling you._ [[UB 109:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_2)]

Material disturbances, unstable attitudes and prejudices are factors that hamper the activities of the Adjuster. Also racial inheritance may play its role. Because of these and other obstructions it often happens that in a human consciousness there surge unfinished accomplishments of the Adjuster, which again lead to confused conceptualisations. Material disturbances, unstable attitudes and prejudices are factors that hamper the activities of the Adjuster. Also racial inheritance may play its role. Because of these and other obstructions it often happens that in a human consciousness there surge unfinished accomplishments of the Adjuster, which again lead to confused conceptualisations. This is what is said concerning the problems of human life, the material-temporal compromises which are to be faced, and the achievement of spiritual goals:

> _The great problem of life is the adjustment of the ancestral tendencies of living to the demands of the spiritual urges initiated by the divine presence of the Mystery Monitor. While in the universe and superuniverse careers no man can serve two masters, in the life you now live on Urantia every man must perforce serve two masters. He must become adept in the art of a continuous human temporal compromise while be yields spiritual allegiance to but one master; and this is why so many falter and fail, grow weary and succumb to the stress of the evolutionary struggle._ [[UB 109:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_5)]

> _While the hereditary legacy of cerebral endowment and that of electrochemical overrontrol both operate to delimit the sphere of efficient Adjuster activity, no hereditary handicap (in normal minds) ever prevents eventual spiritual acbievement. Heredity may interfere with the rate of personality conquest, but it does not prevent eventual consummation of the ascendant adventure. If you will co-operate with your Adjuster, the divine gift will, sooner or later, evolve the immortal morontia soul and, subsequent to fusion therewith, will present the new creature to the sovereign Master Son of the local universe and eventually to the Father of Adjusters on Paradise._ [[UB 109:5.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_5)]

Many of you may feel that what was said above is not exhaustive. Nonetheless, the text comes with a number of important and even startling pieces of knowledge conceming the relation of Adjusters to creatures. What is essential is that each of us has been bestowed with a Mystery Monitor who guides and cultivates our mind and development. And we have free will for action. Let us learn, let us progress and grow. It is possible for all of us. Heavenly Father, thank you for all of that. And thank you for your attention.
