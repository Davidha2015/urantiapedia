In our daily struggles to live in the presence and to share our inner life with God, it is helpfull to be **A**ware of a **B**etter **C**hoice of thought. There is always available to us a higher, better thought or attitude if we sincerely desire to be led by the Spirit.

Why not use our “priceless power of choice?” When we are feeling inadequate or stuck or just too human, think ABC and choose _God's will power_ instead of our own.

Whatever situation we find ourselves in, whatever mindset we've sunken into, in _faith_ we can ask to become **A**ware of a **B**etter **C**hoice and we are promised “the Spirit of Truth will always speak, saying, ‘This is the way’.” [[UB 34:7.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/34#p7_8)]
