_This beautiful poem was written by Leith during the 1990 Australian Conference._

I'm composed, and full of feeling.
I'm enwrapped in silent healing.
The air flows cool in the Father's mountains.
There isn't much to say
how we spend each pleasant day,
but know, deep down within,
that God's Spark is close to Him.
Our walks of life take different tolls 
of moods, of thoughts, we're all different moulds.
Sometimes we cry for inner peace.
We're glad to have a part, a piece
of Life's adjusting inwardly and outwards.
The chores of climbing and the upward search
to find a cloud, a rising perch.
The Pilot watches, waits, and prompts us.
The waiting seems in patience dwells.
We burn the midnight oils of searching
to do the will, within ourselves.
I'm looking back on years of thinking.
I'm slowly moving, I'm surely not sinking.
And while I have the goal in sight,
I'll carry on my Godward flight,
merging, feeling; it's a pleasant surprise
to grasp, enjoy, and embrace all my ties.


**Leith Luckett, Melbourne**
