The religious issue of abortion centers around the perception that abortion takes away eternal life. In reality, no human possesses the capability to deprive any other being of eternal life. Such an event can occur only as the result of a personal, repletely knowledgeable decision regarding the consequences of such a decision.

When death occurs before the decision regarding eternal life can be made, the being is held in trustworthy limbo until one or the other of its natal parents arrives and is then repersonalized to continue its life process.

There also exists sufficient information for supposing that if a fetus is aborted, by any process, before endowment with mind function (which is more than brain function) that human potential and its accompanying life energies are absorbed into the sources from which they sprang.

Remember that all pregnant females may experience a natural abortion, usually during the first third of their gestation. Nothing of love, truth, beauty or goodness is ever lost in all the universe of universes.

The following excerpts from _The Urantia Book_, designated by page and paragraph will provide further conceptual enhancement.
