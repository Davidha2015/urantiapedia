<p style="text-align:center;">
The four candles were burning slowly.<br>
The atmosphere was so quiet that you could hear their dialogue.<br>
The first said:<br>
I am peace, but people can't keep me. I think I'm going to turn off. And, rapidly diminishing its fire, it went out completely.<br>
The second said:<br>
I am faith. Unfortunately, men find me superfluous. People don't want to know about me. It makes no sense to stay on. When she finished speaking, a breeze passed gently over her and she was blown out.<br>
Quick and sad, the third candle manifested:<br>
I am love. I do not have the strenght to keep on. People push me aside and don't understand my importance. They forget even those who are very close and love them. And, without waiting any longer, it turned off.<br>
Suddenly, a boy came in and saw the three extinguished candles. But what is this? You should be on till the end.<br>
Saying this he began to cry.<br>
Then the fourth candle spoke:<br>
Do not be afraid. As long as I have a fire we can light the other candles.<br>
I am the hope!<br>
Bright-eyed, the boy grabbed the candle that was still burning and lit the others.<br>
May hope never go out within us!<br>
And that each one of us knows how to be the tool that children need to maintain hope, faith, peace and love!<br>
