## Introduction

Consider your soul as a refuge from the isolation of the materialistic ego self and its worldly concerns. Experience it as the sacred place of peace wherein the Spirit of the Father dwells and communes in loving fellowship with the spirit of his Son, the Spirit of Truth. Now, sense as well, the presence of your spiritual brothers and sisters. Know with certainty that this soul is the ground of our common being; the consciousness of self-lessness, the Kingdom of Heaven, The family of God, the essence of true spiritual community, the temple in which our Father through union with each and all of us becomes self-realized as community, true brotherhood, the Supreme.
