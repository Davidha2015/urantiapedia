_The Urantia Book_ purports to be the Fifth Epochal Revelation. Such a claim is audacious and raises serious doubts for people with critical minds. Those of us who feel threatened by such revelatory claims (and a 2000 page book with strange terminology and authorship) quickly brush it aside as another crackpot invention. Many of the curious among us, however, have decided to give this claim critical examination.

The basic test of new revelation is a threefold check: (1) Does it harmonize and resonate with our highest personal experience and reasoning; (2) does it confirm and build on the best of previous revelation; and, (3) do people with balanced and critical minds confirm your own evaluation? Among the thousands of people who have seriously examined _The Urantia Book_, there is virtually unanimous agreement that this unique book passes all of the criteria for testing new revelation with flying colors. Students of the Bible are particularly grateful for the enlarged information of _The Urantia Book_ that confirms and brings greater authenticity to the basic truths of the Bible.

The December, 1996 issue of _The Disciple_ carries an article entitled, “When the Bible Upsets Us,” by Dr. Marti J. Steussy, Old Testament professor at Christian Theological Seminary. Dr. Steussy rejects any notion of divine dictation regarding the Bible, and acknowledges that there are many disturbing passages that need further clarification and thought. Readers of _The Urantia Book_ will find many of these disturbing passages clarified and enhanced along with expanded spiritual insights, and the entire context of the Bible illuminated by an inspiring picture of the spiritual cosmos.

The companion relationship between the Bible and _The Urantia Book_ is even more closely integrated than is the companion relationship between the Old Testament and the New Testament. Just as the New Testament enhances appreciation of the Old Testament, so _The Urantia Book_ increases one's understanding and appreciation of the entire Bible.
