**By Michael Bain**

## I

May the knowledge, wisdom, and truth that we glean 
be transferred and exemplified in our daily living.
May your fragmented self, the Mystery Monitor, coalesce 
these ideals in your mind and philosophy and faith.
May we be the reflective amplifiers of your Love \& Light.
May they shine upon a gladly receiving world and may 
every soul know You through us.


## II

God grant me the courage and patience to deal with 
those persons and situations that are a test to my faith. 
I know that on this imperfect sphere trials 
and tribulations are common, 
but they can be effective tools 
to shape my spiritual destiny. 
May your unbounded Love conquer all.
