Much of my continuing research on spiritually ideal family lifestyles has its roots in Julia Fenderson's earlier works on parenting and child rearing. She once told me of the importance of having others continue her work in guiding parents into more spiritually fruitful family practices.

The ultimate role model for family life as a father and creative brother is that of Jesus. There are a multitude of references in _The Urantia Book_ about Jesus and his relationship to his family. Besides providing for their financial welfare, Jesus took a keen personal interest in the spiritual welfare of every one of his brothers and sisters.

Of course, as a parental model Jesus' bottom line was following the will of the Father. Jesus knew God never left his children, so naturally his fatherly example centered on his obligation of watchcare and support for his family. The following are a few examples of Jesus' problem solving skills as a creative parent.
