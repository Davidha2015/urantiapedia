Man does not live by bread alone but by value seeds planted in the child-mind, these spiritual values to be discovered later in life by the eye of faith. Man lives by these qualities comprehensible as love, truth, beauty, and goodness. Man lives by loving and being loved, by an outgoing concern for the good of others equal to self-concern. Man does not live by bread alone but by the inspiration of friends who speak words of encouragement and gratitude. Man lives by giving heed to the beautiful in place of the ugly. Beauty arouses a hunger which is never satisfied and man lives by continually falling in love with beauty. Man is part of the rich variety of life, living by the brilliance of a sunrise, the beauty of changing clouds, the jubilant song of birds, the fragrance of flowers, and the magic of music. When man has fed the body he should learn how also to feed the soul.
