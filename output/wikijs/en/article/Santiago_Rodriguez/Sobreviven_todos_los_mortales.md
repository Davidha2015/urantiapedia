In order not to extend myself too much, I will limit my reflection to giving an answer based on the reading of the UB to two questions:

- Will all mortals survive, that is, will all the inhabitants of Urantia awaken in the mansion worlds?
- If not, what are the requirements for it?

This is a thorny issue, in the sense that apparently contradictory feelings and desires are intermingled, which on the other hand we are not clear if they come from purely human emotions, such as the idea that “he who is not good” purges in some way way for what he has done, that he “personally suffers” some kind of consequence for those acts that we consider heinous or violations of the morality or ethics of the moment in which they are committed.

It is true that we have managed to understand that both morality and ethics depend on the historical moment and the place where they are questioned, but it is also true that it seems “just” to us that the moral position that is in use at a given moment is respected. , and consequently there should be some way to reward or punish the attacks against that ethics or morality (or at least some kind of personal consequence)

On the other hand, we have an idea/ideal of Divine Mercy for which the idea that the Father's mercy would make every man survive physical death and have one more possibility of surviving not only natural death, but to become Adjuster-fused to achieve immortality.

We would gladly renounce our particular and private idea about Justice, and we could understand that even the most perverse human beings can have an opportunity to recognize their errors and even their sins, if not in this life in the next, in the light of the new realities that present themselves to them.

Somehow we intuit that the fact of surviving physical death, given the level of ignorance and the dark times that particularly on this planet we have had to live, is not dependent (at least not only) on the behavior of people, from what we usually say about them being good or bad, and especially considering that both “good” and “bad” are completely relative.

We also have the clear and forceful message of the UB that presents us with the idea that the continuity of existence depends on the conscious and unequivocal decision of the creature, whether or not to want to continue it, as is clearly reflected in the following paragraph:

> _This does not mean that human beings are to enjoy a second opportunity in the face of the rejection of a first, not at all. But it does signify that all will creatures are to experience one true opportunity to make one undoubted, self-conscious, and final choice. The sovereign Judges of the universes will not deprive any being of personality status who has not finally and fully made the eternal choice; the soul of man must and will be given full and ample opportunity to reveal its true intent and real purpose._ ([UB 112:5.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_9))

And reaffirmed with the following expression:

> _Confusion, being puzzled, even sometimes discouraged and distracted, does not necessarily signify resistance to the leadings of the indwelling Adjuster. Such attitudes may sometimes connote lack of active co-operation with the divine Monitor and may, therefore, somewhat delay spiritual progress, but such intellectual emotional difficulties do not in the least interfere with the certain survival of the God-knowing soul. Ignorance alone can never prevent survival; neither can confusional doubts nor fearful uncertainty. Only conscious resistance to the Adjuster’s leading can prevent the survival of the evolving immortal soul._ ([UB 110:3.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_5))

The conclusion that could be drawn is that, given that on the one hand in this world we do not manage to be aware of the Adjuster in a clear way, together with the lack of resources that we do not possess due to causes and circumstances beyond our control; and on the other hand, the prevailing confusion and lack of knowledge, we could conclude that we cannot issue the final decision in life in the flesh. Therefore, we should all survive death and thus be able to make the choice in an unquestionable way, with greater knowledge of the facts, on the mansion worlds.

Let us inquire a little into what the UB presents to us about mortal survival, and we may be surprised by some of the answers to the two questions that we have asked ourselves. There are very important nuances to take into account, so I think that things are not automatic. In other words, the mere fact of being born on this planet does not guarantee our survival after physical death.

If that were so, it would invite laziness at the very least. Once again, we will discover that our free will is really sacred and our will will decide, however immature it may be. What is asked of us is nothing more than a response of our will to an intuition that appears in our minds in a very simple way and that is posed to everyone, and the “correct answer” is within the reach of EVERYONE.

Does survival after natural death really depend on us, or would it be a natural and independent step for us? In order to set the stage for reasoning, let us ask ourselves:

Why is survival necessary/desirable?

What is the first cause that makes us start a long and arduous pilgrimage? Let's take a quote from the UB:

> “_The enlightened worlds all recognize and worship the Universal Father, the eternal maker and infinite upholder of all creation. The will creatures of universe upon universe have embarked upon the long, long Paradise journey, the fascinating struggle of the eternal adventure of attaining God the Father. The transcendent goal of the children of time is to find the eternal God, to comprehend the divine nature, to recognize the Universal Father. God-knowing creatures have only one supreme ambition, just one consuming desire, and that is to become, as they are in their spheres, like him as he is in his Paradise perfection of personality and in his universal sphere of righteous supremacy. From the Universal Father who inhabits eternity there has gone forth the supreme mandate, “Be you perfect, even as I am perfect.” In love and mercy the messengers of Paradise have carried this divine exhortation down through the ages and out through the universes, even to such lowly animal-origin creatures as the human races of Urantia._” ([UB 1:0.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/1#p0_3))

There is an exhortation/mandate from the Universal Father, which is what sets in motion a huge number of creatures and forces/energies aimed at carrying out this simple order.

Notice that the exhortation is not to “be good” as I am good, nor to be merciful, or compassionate, OR careful, or loving, or whatever ideas/ideals we can conceive of Deity. It goes beyond each of the things that can occur to us separately.

So suddenly we could think that what he asks of us is impossible, because He is Perfect, and we cannot reach that degree even by far, and even less now in our mortal life; It would seem that he is asking for “pears from the elm.” Is it that the Father has gone crazy?

Obviously he hasn't gone crazy, because he doesn't ask us to be just as perfect as him; it is not about reaching His level of perfection.

What he is really asking of us is that we be perfect in our sphere or level of reality, but since our level of reality is evolutionary, what he expects of us is that we begin first with the search for that perfection, that we set out for to progress Because obviously we all understand that perfection (for us) is a goal that in itself is not fully achievable, it is a horizon.

The Universal Father is so understanding, so careful with his creatures, so loving that we will see that **he does not ask us to reach a certain level, but only to put us on the path...**

This is His Will, and our will is only aligned with His if we seek this perfection, in our sphere, in our realm, to become perfect as He Is in the Absolute.

And this includes that our **inexcusable task** in this sphere is that search for knowledge and experiences that bring us closer to Him. That allow us to achieve ever greater degrees of perfection.

And I say inexcusable because we are not completely helpless nor are we unaware of everything. Quite the contrary, because we have a more than considerable series of tools that will allow us to start and progress in the search for perfection, to follow His Will; even if we lack knowledge, we have these basic intuitions included in our “programming as individuals with personality”, to be able to PROGRESS IF WE WANT. But be careful, nothing will go against our will if we want to or if we choose not to. Survival of physical death depends on us inexcusably.

There is something that really catches my attention in this regard:

The different revelations of the time have invariably been directed not to insist that we have to be good, or holy, or that we have to learn a lot of science, or that we have to be brotherly with all men. Notice the fact that the invariable Message has been: THERE IS A GOD, he is our Father, therefore we are all brothers. YOU HAVE TO GO IN YOUR SEARCH.

**Why this message?** Why is it important to keep it in mind in our life in the flesh? If in our mortal life we do without HIM, or do not even consider his existence, we will find him later on in the first mansion world. We have all eternity. With this attitude, what we do is resist the influences of the Helping Mind Spirit that is in charge of inducing us to worship.

The UB shows us a series of “serial mechanisms” available to human beings. Once analyzed, we will see that it does not make sense to maintain a position that “I am not reactive to the Spirit of Adoration.” We could justify ignorance, but how will we excuse the unwillingness to start a search, in the three realms of reality that are presented to us? How can we have the courage to recognize that we are reactive to two of them but not to the third intuition?

Let's observe our reality, and see our gifts (I repeat innate, since we are all born with them):

1. We are born, we are given a physical body as a vehicle of expression and container that will house our personality, that which makes us unique.
2. We are endowed with a (borrowed) mind capable of housing an Adjuster. We are lucky that it comes without asking for it, as it did before Pentecost.
3. We have a personality, and I understand that it is this personality that is endowed with will, which decides at every moment. We have been endowed with a series of mechanisms that are part of the endowment of animals in this world (not pejorative at all) that will allow us to live here as one more species.

In addition, we have something bigger: does anyone doubt that he has a will? Even if we don't know that we have a “personality”, does anyone doubt that each of us is different from the others? The fact of having a will differentiates us, separates us from the animal kingdom. And together with the Will, a group of tools automatically appears that we cannot ignore, because they are inherent to our essence as human beings with survival potential, and although we are not aware of their existence, they work for us autonomously: The UB tells us that the fact of possessing will, automatically incorporates the power to choose to adore and ascend.

> _These messages from Salvington, Edentia, and Jerusem formally marked the termination of the Life Carriers’ agelong supervision of the planet. For ages we had been on duty, assisted only by the seven adjutant mind-spirits and the Master Physical Controllers. And now, will, the power of choosing to worship and to ascend, having appeared in the evolutionary creatures of the planet, we realized that our work was finished, and our group prepared to depart. Urantia being a life-modification world, permission was granted to leave behind two senior Life Carriers with twelve assistants, and I was chosen as one of this group and have ever since been on Urantia._ ([UB 62:7.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/62#p7_6))

My conclusion from this paragraph is that the fact of possessing will is equivalent to possessing the ability of Adoration and the ability to ascend. That is, to overcome material death and be able to continue in the mansion worlds. But the sentence in bold seems to say that both the action of worship and the intention of ascension (of continued existence) <ins>is a choice</ins> of the creature, <ins>not an achievement acquired</ins> by the fact of possessing will.

We have a mind that since the appearance of the will (Andón and Fonta), is reactive to the 7 Helping Mind Spirits and is special, which differentiates us from the rest of the animals because we are reactive to the 6th and 7th spirits, of adoration and wisdom. And this mind is innately receptive to the spiritual currents that these 6th and 7th Adjutant Mind Spirits elicit.

In addition, this mind that we possess, due to the fact that it is a differentiation of the cosmic mind, is reactive, it is receptive in an INNATE way (it becomes capable of automatically revealing itself without the participation of the creature's will) to discernments or intuitions on three levels. of universal reality:

1. <ins>Causality</ins>. Scope of the physical senses, the logical uniformity of science, the differentiation of the factual and non-factual.
2. <ins>Duty</ins>. Field of moral reality and philosophy, reason and the recognition of relative good and evil.
3. <ins>Worship</ins>. Spiritual scope of the reality of the religious experience. It includes personal understanding of divine brotherhood, recognition of spiritual values, assurance of eternal survival.

> _The cosmic mind unfailingly responds (recognizes response) on three levels of universe reality. These responses are self-evident to clear-reasoning and deep-thinking minds. These levels of reality are:_ ([UB 16:6.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_5))

> _In the local universe mind bestowals, these three insights of the cosmic mind constitute the a priori assumptions which make it possible for man to function as a rational and self-conscious personality in the realms of science, philosophy, and religion. Stated otherwise, the recognition of the *reality* of these three manifestations of the Infinite is by a cosmic technique of self-revelation. Matter-energy is recognized by the mathematical logic of the senses; mind-reason intuitively knows its moral duty; spirit-faith (worship) is the religion of the reality of spiritual experience. These three basic factors in reflective thinking may be unified and co-ordinated in personality development, or they may become disproportionate and virtually unrelated in their respective functions. But when they become unified, they produce a strong character consisting in the correlation of a factual science, a moral philosophy, and a genuine religious experience. And it is these three cosmic intuitions that give objective validity, reality, to man’s experience in and with things, meanings, and values._ ([UB 16:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p6_10))

We can find more references to the fact that there are these automatic and self-revealing mechanisms that are precisely aimed at allowing all creatures to choose without prior knowledge, and regardless of any other sociocultural circumstance.

The possession of the Personality that the Father grants to each individual in our mortal realm is characterized by two phenomena **that manifest automatically**:
1. Self-awareness: it is the intellectual awareness of the reality of the personality.
2. The relative free will associated. And what is relevant to the questions of survival at hand is that this relative free will is concerned with:

> 1. Moral decision, highest wisdom.
> 2. Spiritual choice, truth discernment.
> 3. Unselfish love, brotherhood service.
> 4. Purposeful co-operation, group loyalty.
> 5. Cosmic insight, the grasp of universe meanings.
> 6. Personality dedication, wholehearted devotion to doing the Father’s will.
> 7. Worship, the sincere pursuit of divine values and the wholehearted love of the divine Value-Giver. ([UB 16:8.8-14](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_8))

Insisting on what has been previously commented, the endowment of mind and personality that characterizes us makes us AUTOMATICALLY receptive in the three levels of reality that we can aspire to understand and progress:

1. To the recognition of the cause effect of physics.
2. To a reasoned recognition of an obligation of moral conduct.
3. And what is more important: the understanding by faith, of the fraternal adoration of the deity, or what is the same, the recognition of its existence.

> _1. Moral decision, highest wisdom._
> 
> _2. Spiritual choice, truth discernment._
> _3. Unselfish love, brotherhood service._
> 4. Purposeful co-operation, group loyalty. ([UB 16:8.8-11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p8_8))

Later he insists on the same fact:

> The cosmic-mind-endowed, Adjuster-indwelt, personal creature possesses innate recognition-realization of energy reality, mind reality, and spirit reality. The will creature is thus equipped to discern the fact, the law, and the love of God. Aside from these three inalienables of human consciousness, all human experience is really subjective except that intuitive realization of validity attaches to the *unification* of these three universe reality responses of cosmic recognition. ([UB 16:9.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_1))

> .... _En la autoconciencia humana existen cuatro comprensiones latentes e inberentes de la realidad universal:_
> 1. _La búsqueda del conocimiento, la lógica de la ciencia._
> 2. _La búsqueda de los valores morales, el sentido del deber._
> 3. _La búsqueda de los valores espirituales, la experiencia religiosa. 196:9 4. La búsqueda de los valores de la personalidad, la habilidad de reconocer la realidad de Dios como personalidad y la comprensión paralela de nuestra relación fraternal con las demás personalidades_ <a id="a157_279"></a>[LU 16:9.9-13](/es/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_9)

It seems clear to me that we cannot excuse the fact that someone does not start their search for God in some way because they do not know that God exists, or what is the same, because the gods they have been told about do not convince them.

It is clear that there is a mechanism that drives you to it, the inclination to search is inherent in the creature with a will. But it is precisely the will of the creature that decides to take the step of starting the search or not, the one that decides to live behind it, or to try to make a minimal gesture aimed at progressing in each of these three facets of reality. using as a starting point these three intuitions that we have within ourselves.

In the following quote it is clearly described that we have a uniform spiritual endowment capable in any circumstance and environment of presenting to the creature the self-revelations necessary for progress in the three aspects of reality that surrounds us, but again I insist that the creature has the last word.

> _The mortals of the realms of time and space may differ greatly in innate abilities and intellectual endowment, they may enjoy environments exceptionally favorable to social advancement and moral progress, or they may suffer from the lack of almost every human aid to culture and supposed advancement in the arts of civilization; but the possibilities for spiritual progress in the ascension career are equal to all; increasing levels of spiritual insight and cosmic meanings are attained quite independently of all such sociomoral differentials of the diversified material environments on the evolutionary worlds._ ([UB 5:1.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_4))

> _However Urantia mortals may differ in their intellectual, social, economic, and even moral opportunities and endowments, forget not that their spiritual endowment is uniform and unique. They all enjoy the same divine presence of the gift from the Father, and they are all equally privileged to seek intimate personal communion with this indwelling spirit of divine origin, while they may all equally choose to accept the uniform spiritual leading of these Mystery Monitors._ ([UB 5:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_5))

> _Man is spiritually indwelt by a surviving Thought Adjuster. If such a human mind is sincerely and spiritually motivated, if such a human soul desires to know God and become like him, honestly wants to do the Father’s will, there exists no negative influence of mortal deprivation nor positive power of possible interference which can prevent such a divinely motivated soul from securely ascending to the portals of Paradise._ ([UB 5:1.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/5#p1_7))

I understand that the first decision has to be made on Urantia (here and now), and this is independent of all other situations of time, or of social, economic, religious status, etc. Later we will find more quotes that support the proposal that this response/attitude towards Deity is taken on Urantia.

We can claim ignorance regarding concepts, ideas/ideals of God or duty, or morality, good and evil. We can excuse erroneous ideas about those concepts due to the lack of knowledge and experience in our walk; but even if we do not know the laws of nature, the laws that govern causal events, we should not live as if they did not exist, even if we are not capable due to ignorance of correctly resolving some Good/Evil duality, we should not ignore that this duality exists Although we are not capable of correctly conceptualizing God and his relationship with us, due to lack of knowledge or experience, we must not eradicate it from our minds, and we must not silence that force that drives us (which from what it says here is not a gift of a few, but is universal) to seek a God.

What happens if we silence, if we ignore or try to silence these three intuitions? My personal opinion is that:

- If we silence the 1st we will not progress materially, we will lose all the advances of science. If we don't work in that direction, science by itself will not develop.
- If we silence the 2nd intuition, we will not be able to respond to the new situations that arise with the changes that occur in the different civilizations. There will be no way to regulate, or even to harmonize, our own coexistence, with changing circumstances born of different cultures and development situations.
- If we silence the 3rd intuition, if we drown it out, it is my opinion that we will be depriving ourselves of the possibility of continuing our existence after physical death.

My conclusion after analyzing these arguments is that not all mortals automatically survive. Obviously, saving the possibility that there are other mechanisms that provide the other possibility, but for me they are not conclusions from what I read in the mentioned paragraphs.

There are several parts of the UB that point to that possibility, since they account for what happens if you don't survive. Given that it is a revelation, I tend to consider what it reveals to us to be of paramount importance to us and our survival. I wouldn't find it reasonable that they entertain themselves by commenting on theoretical possibilities. What sense would that make?

In many places we find allusions to what happens in the event that the human individual does not survive. If it appears so much, I understand that it is because that possibility exists and occurs (even if it is in a minimum number of individuals).

What is clear is that I am trying to elucidate a qualitative question. That is to say, I do not claim to know how many survive or who they are; only the qualitative question of whether all mortals on Urantia do it automatically or, if not, because conditions have to be given that depend entirely on the will of the creature (evidently, in the period of time that he lives on Urantia as a mortal). ).

> _If mortal man fails to survive natural death, the real spiritual values of his human experience survive as a part of the continuing experience of the Thought Adjuster. The personality values of such a nonsurvivor persist as a factor in the personality of the actualizing Supreme Being. Such persisting qualities of personality are deprived of identity but not of experiential values accumulated during the mortal life in the flesh. The survival of identity is dependent on the survival of the immortal soul of morontia status and increasingly divine value. Personality identity survives in and by the survival of the soul._ ([UB 16:9.3](/en/The_Urantia_Book/16#p9_3))

Here he tells us what happens in the event that a mortal individual with an Adjuster, even with a soul, does not survive natural death. On the other hand, in paper 30, where he speaks to us about “The Personalities of the Great Universe”, he defines the Ascending Pilgrims as the surviving mortals of time and space who have been accredited for the progressive ascent to Paradise. It describes us 1) The Planetary Mortals, and 2) The Asleep Survivors (the mortals of survival state) It does not say that they are all mortals, but only those that present survival potential. In fact, it relates that the list is passed at age and the kingdom is awarded to the arrival of a Son of God. If all mortals survived, it would not be necessary to pass such a list:

> _While the mortal survivors of time and space are denominated *ascending pilgrims* when accredited for the progressive ascent to Paradise, these evolutionary creatures occupy such an important place in these narratives that we here desire to present a synopsis of the following seven stages of the ascending universe career:_
> _While the mortal survivors of time and space are denominated *ascending pilgrims* when accredited for the progressive ascent to Paradise, these evolutionary creatures occupy such an important place in these narratives that we here desire to present a synopsis of the following seven stages of the ascending universe career:_
> _While the mortal survivors of time and space are denominated *ascending pilgrims* when accredited for the progressive ascent to Paradise, these evolutionary creatures occupy such an important place in these narratives that we here desire to present a synopsis of the following seven stages of the ascending universe career:_
> _While the mortal survivors of time and space are denominated *ascending pilgrims* when accredited for the progressive ascent to Paradise, these evolutionary creatures occupy such an important place in these narratives that we here desire to present a synopsis of the following seven stages of the ascending universe career:_ ([UB 30:4.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_1))

> _3. Mansion World Students._ ([UB 30:4.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/30#p4_4))

Christ Michael led a large number of captives, the sleeping survivors, he does not say that they were all those who had died and had not repersonalized in the third period. There were many, but not all. In addition, it seems symptomatic to me that he calls some Planetary Mortals (and not precisely “Planetary survivors”), and the others curiously “Survivors”, that is, those who have survived, I understand that it is a fraction of the total Planetary Mortals. We have more quotes that lead me to a similar conclusion:

> _Nonspiritual mind is either a spirit-energy manifestation or a physical-energy phenomenon. Even human mind, personal mind, has no survival qualities apart from spirit identification. Mind is a divinity bestowal, but it is not immortal when it functions without spirit insight, and when it is devoid of the ability to worship and crave survival._ ([UB 36:5.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/36#p5_17))

> _As to just why this type of creature is never able to fuse with the Adjusters of the Universal Father, I am unable to say. Some of us incline to the belief that the Life Carriers, in their efforts to formulate beings capable of maintaining existence in an unusual planetary environment, are confronted with the necessity of making such radical modifications in the universe plan of intelligent will creatures that it becomes inherently impossible to bring about permanent union with the Adjusters. Often have we asked: Is this an intended or an unintended part of the ascension plan? but we have not found the answer._ ([UB 40:5.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/40#p5_16))

This last paragraph is definitive: continuity is not a gift, it is an achievement with certain conditions. The existence of a soul within us does not guarantee survival just like that. There is a condition to be met that depends solely and exclusively on the will of the creature: it is essential that they present the impulse (even if it is rudimentary) to find God and achieve divine perfection. It is also explicitly indicated in the following paragraph that there are beings that do not survive:

> _Thus are the sleeping survivors of a planetary age repersonalized in the dispensational roll calls. But with regard to the nonsalvable personalities of a realm, no immortal spirit is present to function with the group guardians of destiny, and this constitutes cessation of creature existence. While some of your records have pictured these events as taking place on the planets of mortal death, they all really occur on the mansion worlds._ ([UB 49:6.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_7))

In [UB 47:2.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p2_2) (The Trial Period Nursery):

> "_.... In the event of the survival of one or both parents of the child,..._”

And furthermore, this choice of continuity beyond physical death seems to have to occur during the mortal's adulthood on the planet of birth, as can be seen from the explanation of the following situations. Later, in 47:2.4, we find one more note. From what is seen, the decision is expected to be made in youth/infancy in life in the flesh, since he is talking about children (up to 16 years old) who reach death before making up their minds:

> “_All children on the evolving worlds who have Thought Adjusters, but who before death had not made a choice concerning the Paradise career, are also repersonalized on the finaliter world of the system, where they likewise grow up in the families of the Material Sons and their associates as do those little ones who arrived without Adjusters, but who will subsequently receive the Mystery Monitors after attaining the requisite age of moral choice._” ([UB 47:2.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/47#p2_4))

> _3. *Mortals of the probationary-dependent orders of ascension.* The arrival of an Adjuster constitutes identity in the eyes of the universe, and all indwelt beings are on the roll calls of justice. But temporal life on the evolutionary worlds is uncertain, and many die in youth before choosing the Paradise career. Such Adjuster-indwelt children and youths follow the parent of most advanced spiritual status, thus going to the system finaliter world (the probationary nursery) on the third day, at a special resurrection, or at the regular millennial and dispensational roll calls._ ([UB 49:6.11](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_11))

> _Children who die when too young to have Thought Adjusters are repersonalized on the finaliter world of the local systems concomitant with the arrival of either parent on the mansion worlds. A child acquires physical entity at mortal birth, but in the matter of survival all Adjusterless children are reckoned as still attached to their parents._ ([UB 49:6.12](/en/The_Urantia_Book/49#p6_12))

> _As related to fusion candidates, if a Mystery Monitor is deserted by the mortal associate, if the human partner declines to pursue the ascending career, when released by natural death (or prior thereto), the Adjuster carries away everything of survival value which has evolved in the mind of that nonsurviving creature. If an Adjuster should repeatedly fail to attain fusion personality because of the nonsurvival of successive human subjects, and if this Monitor should subsequently be personalized, all the acquired experience of having indwelt and mastered all these mortal minds would become the actual possession of such a newly Personalized Adjuster, an endowment to be enjoyed and utilized throughout all future ages. A Personalized Adjuster of this order is a composite assembly of all the survival traits of all his former creature hosts._ ([UB 109:6.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p6_2))

Without entering into considerations of the Adjuster's actions in the personality, nor the possibilities of personal spiritual growth, nor the considerations for the creation and subsequent evolution of the soul, and arranging everything for Adjuster fusion. In my view, immediately and as a prerequisite for all future survival, we have the following situation:

> _Mortal mind is a temporary intellect system loaned to human beings for use during a material lifetime, and as they use this mind, they are either accepting or rejecting the potential of eternal existence. Mind is about all you have of universe reality that is subject to your will, and the soul—the morontia self—will faithfully portray the harvest of the temporal decisions which the mortal self is making. Human consciousness rests gently upon the electrochemical mechanism below and delicately touches the spirit-morontia energy system above. Of neither of these two systems is the human being ever completely conscious in his mortal life; therefore must he work in mind, of which he is conscious. And it is not so much what mind comprehends as what mind desires to comprehend that insures survival; it is not so much what mind is like as what mind is striving to be like that constitutes spirit identification. It is not so much that man is conscious of God as that man yearns for God that results in universe ascension. What you are today is not so important as what you are becoming day by day and in eternity._ ([UB 111:1.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_5))

> _Mind is the cosmic instrument on which the human will can play the discords of destruction, or upon which this same human will can bring forth the exquisite melodies of God identification and consequent eternal survival. The Adjuster bestowed upon man is, in the last analysis, impervious to evil and incapable of sin, but mortal mind can actually be twisted, distorted, and rendered evil and ugly by the sinful machinations of a perverse and self-seeking human will. Likewise can this mind be made noble, beautiful, true, and good—actually great—in accordance with the spirit-illuminated will of a God-knowing human being._ ([UB 111:1.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p1_6))

It is true that they do not expect us to understand in order to be on the path, they do not even ask us to be good. What they ask is that our will yearn for God, desire it. That is to say, that he wishes to begin the supreme mandate of the Universal Father for human beings: to be Perfect as HE is.

Believe that it is wonderful. It does not ask you to be good, being good makes things easier, what they ask is that you yearn to know God:

> _The inevitable result of such a contactual spiritualization of the human mind is the gradual birth of a soul, the joint offspring of an adjutant mind dominated by a human will that craves to know God, working in liaison with the spiritual forces of the universe which are under the overcontrol of an actual fragment of the very God of all creation—the Mystery Monitor. And thus does the material and mortal reality of the self transcend the temporal limitations of the physical-life machine and attain a new expression and a new identification in the evolving vehicle for selfhood continuity, the morontia and immortal soul._ ([UB 111:2.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p2_10))

For me this is the key: if you are good (ethically and morally) but your will refuses to recognize (in any of its possible manifestation) God, you are renouncing the beginning of the formation of your morontia soul, and therefore you are renouncing to the possibility of survival.

Remembering that the mind is a gift of the Mother Spirit of our Universe, it is doubtless that it will take advantage of many occasions to introduce us to the Father in one of its multiple concepts. But if the human being does not voluntarily decide to start yearning to reach Him, there will be nothing to do.

What are we to make of individuals who systematically reject the possibility of the existence of a higher being, who are made “self-sufficient” by pride, and who think it is weak-minded to have to resort to “a higher being”?

> _Of all the dangers which beset man’s mortal nature and jeopardize his spiritual integrity, pride is the greatest. Courage is valorous, but egotism is vainglorious and suicidal. Reasonable self-confidence is not to be deplored. Man’s ability to transcend himself is the one thing which distinguishes him from the animal kingdom._ ([UB 111:6.9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_9))

> _Pride is deceitful, intoxicating, and sin-breeding whether found in an individual, a group, a race, or a nation. It is literally true, “Pride goes before a fall.”_ ([UB 111:6.10](/en/The_Urantia_Book/111#p6_10))

> _An ascending onetime human personality passes through two great phases of increasing volitional dominance over the self and in the universe:_ ([UB 112:2.16](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p2_16))

What happens if the creature persists in its refusal to seek God?

> _Urantians generally recognize only one kind of death, the physical cessation of life energies; but concerning personality survival there are really three kinds:_ ([UB 112:3.1](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_1))

> _1. *Spiritual (soul) death.* If and when mortal man has finally rejected survival, when he has been pronounced spiritually insolvent, morontially bankrupt, in the conjoint opinion of the Adjuster and the surviving seraphim, when such co-ordinate advice has been recorded on Uversa, and after the Censors and their reflective associates have verified these findings, thereupon do the rulers of Orvonton order the immediate release of the indwelling Monitor. But this release of the Adjuster in no way affects the duties of the personal or group seraphim concerned with that Adjuster-abandoned individual. This kind of death is final in its significance irrespective of the temporary continuation of the living energies of the physical and mind mechanisms. From the cosmic standpoint the mortal is already dead; the continuing life merely indicates the persistence of the material momentum of cosmic energies._ ([UB 112:3.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p3_2))

> _That which comes from the Father is like the Father eternal, and this is just as true of personality, which God gives by his own freewill choice, as it is of the divine Thought Adjuster, an actual fragment of God. Man’s personality is eternal but with regard to identity a conditioned eternal reality. Having appeared in response to the Father’s will, personality will attain Deity destiny, but man must choose whether or not he will be present at the attainment of such destiny. In default of such choice, personality attains experiential Deity directly, becoming a part of the Supreme Being. The cycle is foreordained, but man’s participation therein is optional, personal, and experiential._ ([UB 112:5.2](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_2))

There will be many opportunities during material life for us to decide to take that step, but if we are lazy, proud, etc., what will we find? We are given too much information in the UB about the failure of the personality to survive in the human stage, for it to be only a remote or hypothetical possibility:

> _I have observed a Thought Adjuster indwelling a mind on Urantia who has, according to the records on Uversa, indwelt fifteen minds previously in Orvonton. We do not know whether this Monitor has had similar experiences in other superuniverses, but I suspect so. This is a marvelous Adjuster and one of the most useful and potent forces on Urantia during this present age. What others have lost, in that they refused to survive, this human being (and your whole world) now gains. From him who has not survival qualities, shall be taken away even that experienced Adjuster which he now has, while to him who has survival prospects, shall be given even the pre-experienced Adjuster of a slothful deserter._ ([UB 109:4.5](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p4_5))

> _The great problem of life is the adjustment of the ancestral tendencies of living to the demands of the spiritual urges initiated by the divine presence of the Mystery Monitor. While in the universe and superuniverse careers no man can serve two masters, in the life you now live on Urantia every man must perforce serve two masters. He must become adept in the art of a continuous human temporal compromise while he yields spiritual allegiance to but one master; and this is why so many falter and fail, grow weary and succumb to the stress of the evolutionary struggle._ ([UB 109:5.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/109#p5_4))

Then the development of your soul depends on your cooperation with the Adjuster, which translated is nothing more than that your decisions align with the will of the Father, manifested by the guidance of the Adjuster. As I indicated before, the process goes through the following stages:

1. You have a body in which to house a normal mind.
2. You must have an Adjuster so that it can initiate together with your mind, and after it has longed in some way and to some extent to reach, know, arrive at, be, or resemble some ideal of God.
3. You have to allow that soul to grow and develop (achievement of the circles), and that is when we enter into the issues of good/evil and sin, etc.

When we speak of the “supreme decision” we are in a later phase, in which we have opted for God, with which the birth of our soul has begun, and now we have to make it grow and mature so that it is capable of identifying with God. The supreme decision of abandonment will surely take place in the mansion worlds, but for this it is a necessary condition to have engendered the soul, and this does depend on the will of the material creature.

Although I get the impression that there is most likely no specific decision moment, neither in the case of the “ultimate decision” nor in the case of opting for Deity quest, but rather that the survival value goes away. acquiring with successive and reiterated decisions directed towards that search (a similar response on many occasions to repetitive situations of life or experience of the creature) And, trying to align our will with that of the Father, there will come a time when they are one, and it is at this moment that the “creature door is opened” to definitively merge with the Adjuster.

From the following paragraph I deduce that we have to try (I'm not saying achieve, but I think what they do ask us is that we try) to advance in circles (and this also has to start in the flesh):

> _Though the cosmic circles of personality growth must eventually be attained, if, through no fault of your own, the accidents of time and the handicaps of material existence prevent your mastering these levels on your native planet, if your intentions and desires are of survival value, there are issued the decrees of probation extension. You will be afforded additional time in which to prove yourself._ ([UB 112:5.6](/en/The_Urantia_Book/112#p5_6))

> _“I warn you against false prophets who will come to you in sheep’s clothing, while on the inside they are as ravening wolves. By their fruits you shall know them. Do men gather grapes from thorns or figs from thistles? Even so, every good tree brings forth good fruit, but the corrupt tree bears evil fruit. A good tree cannot yield evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree produce good fruit. Every tree that does not bring forth good fruit is presently hewn down and cast into the fire. In gaining an entrance into the kingdom of heaven, it is the motive that counts. My Father looks into the hearts of men and judges by their inner longings and their sincere intentions._ ([UB 140:3.19](/en/The_Urantia_Book/140#p3_19))

Conclusion:

1. Not everyone survives, because survival is not an automatic fact.
2. There is a condition for survival, which depends on the decision of the creature's will.
3. Evidently this decision (which is not the supreme decision that will allow us Adjuster fusion) is to be made on Urantia. This decision is expected to be made during adulthood. And it is within the reach of all creatures of any age or culture.
4. Another condition (except for exceptional cases, of children of pre-Adjuster death) is the presence of the Adjuster, who has to begin to develop the immortal soul.

As a personal “discovery” for me, it is that as an alternative to what I thought before, there is the fact/concept that it is not a matter of being good or bad in itself that will lead us to continuity in the mansion worlds. There is a requirement, which is the voluntary acceptance of the existence of a God, and the fact of trying to start his search, which will undoubtedly lead you to be “good”. Our achievements in the carnal life on Urantia will allow us to achieve more or less rapid spiritual development, they will “shape” our next exterior “containers”.
