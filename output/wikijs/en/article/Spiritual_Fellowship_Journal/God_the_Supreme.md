O Great Mother of all finite creation, we thank you
for generating the nourishing environment of our finite adventure.
In your dynamic Ground of Being we live, and move, and have our being.
You are the Supreme Actualizer of our evolutionary experience, 
urging us to constant growth in our mortal pilgrimage.

You require ever increasing competence and
achievement.

We must do something of significance as well as
be something of spiritual worth.
You challenge us to ascend the psychological
levels of cosmic realization and mind mastery.
You lead us in the finite exploration of the
cosmos, and we rejoice in the promise 
of the thrilling adventures of eternity.
