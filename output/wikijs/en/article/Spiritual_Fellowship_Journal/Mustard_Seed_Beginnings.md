Universal Father, we thank you for your marvelous 
plan for the finite creation.

Here everything has mustard seed beginnings, all 
entities start as germs of potentiality.

On the finite level experience is required, risk and 
courage are involved, effort and suffering are indigenous.

Your Incarnate Son is the divine embodiment of your 
plan and the living assurance of your constant love 
and never ending guidance.

Here in the small, the weak, and the unknown are 
hidden the potentialities of divinity.

In the babe of Bethlehem resides the Sovereign of a 
universe.

Through his matchless life, your light and your truth 
shine in purity and power.

In him we see the latent possibilities of human 
nature.

The Master of Life has opened our consciousness to a 
new and higher level of living.

We who are born into the earthly kingdom of animal 
drives and material mindedness are invited to 
accept a new status as your children in the 
higher kingdom of the spirit.

His Spirit of Truth leads us to transcend the 
dominance of our physiological conditioning through 
the spirit mastery of our material minds to 
achieve a new identity and soul consciousness 
centering in the realities of your kingdom.

We thank you for your Supreme plan of love for your 
finite creation. We rejoice that we are your children 
in time and eternity.
