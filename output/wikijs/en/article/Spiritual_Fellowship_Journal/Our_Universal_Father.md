We love you Universal Father; your shepherding care 
and guidance is the enabling foundation of our 
lives.

As we contemplate your infinite goodness and 
understanding mercy, we are overwhelmed by 
our finitude and imperfection.

The fact of our existence fills us with wonder and 
the mystery of being inspires our aspiration for 
that which is eternal.

You give us our personal identity and bestow the 
integrating and mysterious intangibles of 
personality

We are ennobled by the indwelling presence of your 
spirit.

In the subliminal awareness of your presence, we 
know that we are never alone.

We feel secure in the warmth of your love

Because of your divine imprint on the nature of 
our souls, we:

Strive for that which is moral and good in spite 
of animal tendencies toward selfish pleasure 
and evil.

Believe in your ultimate goodness even when 
we experience personal tragedy and suffering.

Have faith in the triumph of your Supremacy 
despite world calamity and the despairing 
philosophy of materialistic pessimism.

We thank you for the opportunity to elect the quest of 
the ages.

We look forward to the endless education and 
growth which you have in store for us as we 
traverse the grand universe and one day stand 
in your presence on Paradise to be ushered 
into the service adventures of eternity!
