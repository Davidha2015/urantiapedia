I love you, Universal Father, 
and rejoice in your partnership in my life.
I am thankful for the lawful behavior 
of phenomena upon which I can depend.
I am grateful for the values of truth, 
beauty, and goodness that you have established 
to govern all human interaction.
All that is not in harmony with your perfect way 
will eventually perish.
Those who thwart your purposes for humanity 
will be vanquished.
The iniquitous find the way of the transgressor is hard, 
their plans do not prevail. 
Your Triune judgment is the arbiter 
of time and the template of eternity.
The mills of your divine justice turn slowly, but
grind exceedingly fine!
Your Fatherly rule of love is ascendant 
in the worlds of space.
It will bring justice and peace to humankind. 
There is an integration of spiritual influences 
empowering us to transcend our animal legacies. 
A confederation of divine powers is directed 
toward freeing us from our material limitations, 
and finite handicaps.
We rejoice that nothing in all the universe 
can separate us from your Fatherly care and blessing!
