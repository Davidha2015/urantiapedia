I aspire, Universal Father, to new 
expressions of spiritual service indigenous 
to the unique personality you have given me.

I long to achieve the nobility of character 
which feeds the wellsprings of creativity.

Deliver me from the foibles of spiritual 
immaturity:

Pining for optimum conditions rather than 
joyously accepting the rigorous living 
required by evolutionary experience;

Pleading that you solve problems that 
I should courageously grapple with myself; 
and,

Equating my circumscribed world with 
your larger vision.

Enlarge my appreciation of your endless
Paradise resources mediated to us through 
the Supreme ministry of our Universe 
Sovereign.

I am enriched and invigorated by your 
presence and partnership in service and 
soul actualization.

I rejoice in the potentials of your high 
calling.

Keep me ever constant, steadfast, and 
sensitively tuned to your truth, beauty, 
and goodness!
