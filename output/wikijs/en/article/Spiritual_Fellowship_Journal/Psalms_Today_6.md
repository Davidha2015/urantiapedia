O people of earth and heavenly hosts, give glory and honor to the Universal Father, the First Creative Source and Divine

Center of all things and beings.

Wonder and awe, dedication and worship are inspired by the Creator's fathomless presence in the cosmos.

Be led by your loving universe superiors, $O$ mortal, that you too may give the Paradise Father first place in your life!

Happy is the person who senses the universal unity of all things.

In nature we touch the hem of the cloak of God.

My mind contemplates the wisdom of God in universe

events; from the unerring path of the stars to the flower

in the crannied wall, from the progressive march of nations to the expanding co-ordination of the baby's hand.

My soul perceives meaning and value in the

interrelatedness of the atom and the galaxy,

of the cell and the holistic functioning person.

I sense a kinship with all life, with all creation!

Being in tune with the Supreme, we are aware of our cosmic citizenship.

Such a cosmic citizen has outgrown dogma's anthropomorphic God.

How can we compare the Infinite with even nature's wonders?

The roar of thunder is silenced by the Creator's celestial harmony.

The brilliant suns are as dim candles in God's presence. The eyes of the spirit, although obscured by the veil of mortality, behold a vision of the eternal God so vast, so infinite, so awe-inspiring that words are helpless to describe its grandeur.

Yet is this fathomless Deity truly experienced and known!

This Infinite Source of all things is our Universal Father! What a mystery! What an incomprehensible fact of love!
