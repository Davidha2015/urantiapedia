Let your heart sing with joy and devotion to the Lord, our Maker!
Serve the Creator with wisdom and gladness.
Live in his presence with fruitfulness and gratitude.
Know that the Creator is our Sovereign!
It is he that made us, and we are his mortal children.
We are his people,the citizens of his universe.
Recognize his presence with thanksgiving, and
acknowledge his deeds with praise!
Give thanks for his Spirit of Truth, rejoice in his
saving ministry to our troubled world.
For our Universe Father is good; his steadfast love 
is everlasting, and his truth endures to all

> “Love is the highest motivation which man may utilize in his universe ascent. But love divested of truth, beauty, and goodness, is only a sentiment, a philosophic distortion, a psychic illusion, a spirit deception. Love must be redefined on successive levels of morontia and spirit progression.”([UB 196:3.29](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_29))
