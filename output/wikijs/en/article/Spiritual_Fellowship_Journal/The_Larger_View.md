Help me, O God, to discern your will in the alternatives which confront me.
Your way is the evolutionary process undergirded by eternal reality;
Yours is the Supreme pathway which prevails, even through defeat.

Guide me in the way everlasting; orient me as I grope and stumble in my finite pilgrimage.
Deliver me from the deceptions of self-will and the illusions of sophistry whereby I misconstrue my interpretation of your guidance and my chosen pathway of service, as your directions for others.

Enlarge my appreciation of the complexity of the universe; and teach me the values of pluralism in your kingdom.
Illuminate my spiritual insight so that I may understand that those working on alternate courses of the dialectical nature of truth may each be following authentic aspects of your larger plan.
Lead me on the path of wisdom. In my impatience I am tempted to force the process of change and pressure the natural course of development.
Continue to teach me that good ends are never achieved through arbitrary, exploitative, or unethical means.
Open my awareness to the beauty of balance and the ugliness of extremes.

Your spirit of love speaks through personal contact and the fellowship of small groups.
Keep my soul warm with the personal touch.

I thank you, Heavenly Father, for your never failing guidance.
Your love is great, beyond measure; because of your indwelling presence, my life is filled with purpose and joy!
