Dearest Father-Mother, God,
We are Your family, we are your children.

Enlarge our horizons with the power of your love,
That we may obtain real sustenance
from our tender fellowship,
acknowledging one another
as members of a Spirit-centered family whose creator you are.

Offer us the hope of maturity,
the consanguinity of familial affection,
to know the solid support
of spiritual brotherhood,
as we seek to grow in tolerance
and grace.

Guard our hasty tongues and credulous minds
from preoccupation with the trivial transgressions of life.

Set us on the road toward loving-fellow feeling,
that we may share your great love
with those we meet along the way.

This we pray from our inner need, dear God of Life.
May your light so shine upon our darkness
that we become witnesses
to the dawning new day.

— AMEN —

Stephen Zendt, San Francisco, California
