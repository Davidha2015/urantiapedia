“We came to accept that celebrating Jesus' birthday meant sweating profusely... Recognizing the importance of the occasion, we tried hard not to squirm in the heat and did our best to listen intently as the most honored of Forum leaders would read of the Master's life on Urantia.” (See Childhood Days at the Forum, Page 4)
