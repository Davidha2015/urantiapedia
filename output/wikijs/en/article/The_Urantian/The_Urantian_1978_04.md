## Urantia-Model World For The Supreme?

From my first reading of _The URANTIA Book_, I was captivated with the Supreme-with the idea of the Almighty Supreme actualizing in the realms of time and space while the ideal of the character and spirit of the deity had already personalized in Havona. The mystery beckoned and I traced the footsteps of supremacy all through the book, paper by paper. Sometimes the trace was elusive and sometimes evident, but always it was a delight-an ah-ha! The second persistent puzzle (among many lesser ones) is the outworking of this muddled planet. All the superuniverse structure can be called the outworking and inworking of the Supreme in time and space. But is our native sphere so particularly destined?

Why are we so different? Page 1250 lists seven major anomalies of this dust speck, and URANTIA Book readers can easily find many more. Granted each world, system, constellation, local universe, and superuniverse is unique. But our development seems to go much farther than “normal.” Even the gift of _The URANTIA Book_ seems to portend other than the usual progression of evolution.

Are my two favorite puzzles connected? Is our world different because it is especially destined or intended as a model for the Supreme?

It can be reasoned that all decimal planets are planned experiments in evolutionary biology-sociology. Here the physical aspects of supremacy are worked out to statistical completion and repletion throughout all the local universes in the immense creational panorama. But don't forget one of the assignments of our Life Carriers was to develop will potential very early in this planet's upright-walking creature. They succeeded, and mind ministry was challenged to bridge the wide gap between animal and divinity. We are told, but for one, our evolving minds are the most difficult of contact in the universe of Nebadon. The list of our differences and apparent accidents goes on, but what of the plan behind all of this? What of the divine goals?

Nebadon enjoys the rule and creative vision of a Master Michael Son, one who has earned the _supreme_ right to rule through completion of the seven incarnations representing the sevenfold aspect of the existential Gods. His local universe is in the seventh superuniverse, directed and permeated by the Seventh Master Spirit who especially manifests the Trinity in time and space. Apparently the Trinity is to the Supreme what Thought Adjusters are to evolutionary will creatures. Supremacy recognizes achievement. One must accomplish something as well as be born someone. Michael of Nebadon has won his rightful sovereignity. Where does he go from there? What new truths does he manifest? Urantia is the planet where he won his supreme status. It is the planet of his personal rule. It is the birthplace of his human incarnation.

Are there other reasons for thinking that we are particularly a supreme project? Well, let's see, We know that supremacy is based on experiential accomplishment. We know that “_... the local universes are the real laboratories in which are worked out the mind experiments, galactic adventures, divinity unfoldings, and personality progressions which, when cosmically totaled, constitute the actual foundation upon which the Supreme is achieving deity evolution in and by experience._” ([UB 116:4.7](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p4_7)) Are there any indications that our birthplace especially fits these requirements?

Now we can certainly add up the evidence and figure that supreme experience is tough experience. Even Adjusters must earn classification as “self-acting” or “supreme” by serving in a time of crisis in the experience of some human being. Surely Amadon and his indwelling spirit demonstrated such levels at the time of the Lucifer Rebellion.

### Unusual Personal Latitude

Michael of Nebadon encourages his children to courageous and creative thinking. Even after three rebellions he has refused to curtail the unusual latitude of personal liberty he allows his Lanonandek Sons. He designated us to early exhibit will dignity. In spite of the dangers inherent, supreme opportunities are there. Will our world, after a dark, painful, and backward youth, flower as a manifestation of the Supreme in the universe of Nebadon? Certainly we are not hampered by superhuman interference. Our former Planetary Prince was late in arriving and Machiventa Melchizedek has shown no disposition to take up residence in his land of former emergency service. We do have a Council of Twenty-four who represent Christ Michael's special and personal will in our affairs. They seem to have been chosen on the basis of some supreme service which they performed in the past. Oh yes, and Manotia is the Associate Chief of Seraphim on this planet. She's the angel who stood fast for Michael even though her superior fell into treason in the days of the secession.

We have a splendid and special cast here. Our world has a special and splendid destiny. Could it be that we are the model world for the Supreme in the universe of Nebadon?

## Vibrations And Interactions

All of finite reality is vibratory; even our personal interactions with our environment are cyclic, in the sense of there being an ebb and flow in our relationships over time. In any duality or dimension that we can imagine, there is movement along that line-even to the changing of direction-although some of the periods may be so long as for us not to have experienced the fullness of their complete cycle. Everything changes; and everyone interacts with his environment or he ceases to exist. Taken together, all these interactions are finite reality, and their cumulative and super-additive effect is the Supreme Being.

We become conscious of the Supreme as we become aware of the fact, meaning, and value of all the finite interactions that we experience. Our environment acts on us through the vibrations that impinge upon us, and we perceive this flow tide through the various levels of our consciousnes5. Likewise, in all our willful reactions to our environment, we put out an ebb tide of vibrations that contributes back to this sea of finite reality.

The clarity and scope of our individual perceptions and the strength and quality of our individual reactions also change over time, as we grow toward perfection. Each personality, being sovereign in the realm of his part of the interactive cycle, may, when the times come to listen, open his mind to the Father's will; and when the times come to act, do so in the spirit of making his every act a manifestation of the Father's will. Thus may ever more of this sea of vibrations _be_ his evolving perfection — even to supremacy. It all gets better as we each get better, and so evolves the Supreme.

And even this master cycle, whose current phase we see as the evolution of the Supreme, this tide too will turn. In the fullness of time, when all the universe of universes is settled in light and life, then will a vast new phase begin — a phase, no doubt, of ministering back to the imperfection of the next universe age, somewhere in the outer space levels. And as these ages pass, we will enjoy an eternity of perfected service.

## The Necessity Of Action

The Supreme Being is inextricably involved with the good of the whole. As we endeavor to become a better neighbor and a better citizen of our nation it becomes obvious that we are each a citizen of our world, Urantia; and from that insight we discern the necessity of becoming a contributing member of God's cosmic family-a citizen of the universe. In other words we must get into the action through the intelligent use of mind. This constitutes our experiential relationship to the Supreme as we embark on our journey of everlasting progress. All meaningful experience at the finite level is integrated in the Supreme,

The Chief of Seraphim on Urantia postulates that this synthesis of creature experience is largely manifested to the individual will creature through the ministry of the seraphim in their role as coordinators, correlators of mind and morontia, and interpreters. We can avail
ourselves of this marvelous assistance by making our plans and then putting those plans into action. In some little understood technique this enables our guardian angels to assist in bringing those plans to fruition for the good of all those who love God. In this way, and even now on our initial sphere, we can initiate our activities as junior members of a team composed of angels and men. We can share the joy of this adventure in cooperation as we gradually wean ourselves from animal inertia and preoccupation with self.

Not only does the perfect guidance of the spirit within, the gentle leading of our Thought Adjuster, become clearer as we align our will with the will of God, but by our own efforts we are attaching ourselves to destiny. This is our contribution to the growth of the Supreme.

## The Power Of The Supreme

> “_But no God-knowing mortal can ever be lonely in his journey through the cosmos, for he knows that the Father walks beside him each step of the way, while the very way that he is traversing is the presence of the Supreme._” ([UB 117:6.27](/en/The_Urantia_Book/117#p6_27))

Like water seeks a point located lower than its source, thus the Infinite can spread toward the finite, flowing downwards in space-time. The Supreme should be then the centrifugal movement of Infinity toward the Finite, and the Supremacy the centripetal reaction of the finite creation to the call of the Infinite.

An isolated pole can't give any current. That is why the Supreme exteriorizes himself only by virtue of the simultaneous existence of the Finite and Infinite as a current between two potentials immensely removed by which his power (Almighty 5upreme) pulls us up from fugitive realities of space-time, up to the realms of spaceless and timeless realities of Paradise.

Each enthronement of the kingdom in the core of the mortal mind of the finite creatures is an increasing of the power of the Almighty Supreme in space-time creation. And this must be seen as the ministry of the Sevenfold Deity toward space-time-bound creatures.

God is spirit. Mortal beings are material and power is needed to raise them to spirit. That power will have achieved its purpose when the entire time-space creation will be settled in light and life. But the Infinite can not be reached through finite values, which is only the beginning of the super-finite reslization of the Ultimate, and even still the Ultimate cannot be the attainment of the Infinite.

### Infinite To Finite

The faith-vision of God-knowing persons reveals the indwelling presence of the Father, the Thought Adjuster. Such an association between an Absolute mind and a finite mind makes possible the realization of a new reality: the evolving immortal soul, the medium of a time-creature and an eternal being. The simultaneous existence of Absolute Deity and all the finite creatures' minds makes possible the eventuation of the super-soul of creation, the Supreme Being, who evolves by and in them, led by the Paradise Trinity: “_The Mystery Monitors are to human beings what the Paradise Trinity is to the Supreme Being._” ([UB 116:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/116#p3_4))

Such a process makes evident the close interdependence between our evolution and the revelation of God in space-time, the Supreme Being. Likewise, the evolution of the mortal mind is essential for the soul while led by the Thought Adjuster. “_...it appears that all human progress is effected by a technique of conjoint revelational evolution._” ([UB 196:3.15](/en/The_Urantia_Book/196#p3_15)) Whereas a fusion is possible between a mortal and his Mystery Monitor, could a homologous miracle happen between the Supreme and Existential Deity? It seems that it is quite different, according to the papers: the Supreme Being will individualize himself like a real personality knowable by creatures and knowing them.

### Integrating Truth, Beauty, Goodness

The attributes of divinity are understandable for the finite creatures as truth, beauty, and goodness in the divine personality of the Paradise Father. God the Supreme, endowed with the Almighty Supreme and Supreme Mind attributes, cognizable as one unified personality in the future as the Supreme Being, will represent the conjugated natures of the Creator and the creatures, the truth, the beauty, and the goodness perfectly integrated in the experience of a finite being.

It's a great privilege to be called to participate in the growth of the Supreme in the present age, and increasingly in our hearts should develop the awakening of cosmic morality, the universal duty toward the Supreme Being, feeling which is the response of the creature to the infinite love of the Father.

## Supreme Service

Notwithstanding that “_man's intellectual comprehension capacity is exhausted by the maximum conception of the Supreme Being_” ([UB 115:3.4](/en/The_Urantia_Book/115#p3_4)), I know quite simply that we are related because we both have the same last designation —BEING. Even though I as a human being am but a speck of sand and he as the Supreme Being is the Sahara of sand, yet are we of the same family.

In attempting to visualize the unseen finite God I have yet to discern, I picture in my mind's eye Michelangelo's Vatican painting of a human, fatherlike God reaching out to touch the hand of man, his earthly son. It is as if we are the fingertips of the Supreme as he stretches himself way out to farflung Urantia of distant Nebadon on the extreme superuniverse border limits of Orvonton and we increasingly actualize our God-given potentials. Our material consciousnesses become part of the nervous system of the Supreme Being.

On this decimal planet, interestingly enough, Shakespeare utilized but ten words to define life: "To be or not to be, that is the question." If we decide to be, then we are beings and thusly sons and daughters of the Father; to truly be children of the Supreme, we must do or achieve. This, of course, is completely consistent with the Father's plan of finite progress through effort, creature achievement through perseverance, and personality development through faith.

The way we can relate consciously to the Supreme Being in our daily lives is naturally the way of Jesus — loving service to our fellows. We must manifest. It is good and necessary that Urantians share fellowship and gather together for study groups and conferences, but we must do mote than that. The spectrum of social service in which we can personally contribute ranges from feeding needy infants to counseling terminally ill patients.

We are each irreplaceable atoms of the Supreme. In addition to the sacred privilege of hosting Thought Adjusters, we have been entrusted with the once-in-eternity duty of contributing to the growth and evolution of the Supreme Being by transforming our potentialities into actualities. In one sense, being is the end of becoming, but in another, whoever is identified with the I AM can never find an end to progression. Even now, this very eternal moment, the Supreme is reaching out and touching his beloved children of time and space, urging them in turn to touch in their unique way a brother or sister who needs the compassion of Christ. The only failure is to not try.

## In The Future ...

The universe value of each mortal citizen is underscored by a single act of the Universal Father: he willed that each Father fragment — Thought Adjuster — should be responsive to creature will and dependent upon the creature for the attainment of personality. We would like to devote an upcoming issue to the initial exploration of our understanding of the Thought Adjuster and would welcome your contributions.
