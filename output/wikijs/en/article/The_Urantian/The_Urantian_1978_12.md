## Circles Of Supremacy

When I approached the three papers in _The URANTIA Book_ on the Supreme, I was confused with the numerous ways the authors referred to the Supreme. There was the Supreme Being, God the Supreme, and the Almighty Supreme. There was also a reference to the Supreme Mind. I was aware the Supreme was God operating in time and space — a finite deity; but prior to these three papers I believed that the Supreme Being, God the Supreme, and the Almighty Supreme were interchangeable terms used in the same way _The URANTIA Book_ refers to Thought Adjusters as Mystery Monitors, Father fragments, indwelling spirits, etc. Why then were there three separate papers? Suddenly I realized that each term used in reference to the Supreme means something definite and slightly different from each of the other terms.

To help me understand the Supreme Being, I started to draw a correlation between the human mortal, who possesses distinct elements in its nature, and those elements which constitute the Supreme Being.

As human beings, we are composed of matter, mind, spirit, soul, and personality. The Supreme Being likewise has component members consisting of God the Supreme, the Almighty Supreme, and the Supreme Mind.

Just as we have a body, the physical aspect of our existence, so does the Almighty Supreme function as the organizer of the physical aspect of the Supreme Being. "The Almighty Supreme is evolving as the overcontroller of the physical power of the grand universe." (1274.2) "The vast universe is not without those coordinating centers of magnificent overcontrol which might be compared to the delicate chemical-control system of the human mechanism." (1276.3)

We possess a mind, and this endowment of intelligence is bestowed by the Infinite Spirit. Although we know little of the Supreme Mind, we know that the Supreme Mind that functions within the Supreme Being also has its origin in the Infinite Spirit. There is an important function of the Supreme Mind which will be discussed further in this narrative.

_The URANTIA Book_ points out the spirit which dwells in our minds, the Thought Adjuster, is divine and is immortal. Likewise, God the Supreme is the spirit nucleus of the Supreme Being. "What the Trinity is to God the Supreme, the Adjuster is to evolving man." (1282.6)

This little analogy to man helped me to understand the Supreme Being and his component members. I can relate the function of the Almighty Supreme in gaining control of the physical aspects of the grand universe to my own attempts to develop spiritually and intellectually in the framework of a physical body. I can also compare my spirit endowment, the Adjuster, to God the Supreme. And I am able to do this through the function of mind, just as the Supreme Being uses Supreme Mind to correlate facts, meanings, and values of universe significance.

## Soul And Personality

But there were two other elements which needed clarification for me — soul and personality. We have a soul which grows as a result of our free will decisions in conjunction with the activity of our Adjuster. Our soul is neither material nor spiritual, but it is destined to become immortal. The only correlation to the Supreme Being mentioned in _The URANTIA Book_ is "He is the oversoul of the grand universe..." (\cdot(1278.5) This "free will" or volition is bestowed upon our finite existence by the Universal Father, while God the Supreme is the highest finite manifestation of the volitional expression of the Father as well as being the spiritual unification functioning in the Supreme Being.

We also have "personality" which is neither body, mind, spirit, nor the soul, but is a personal gift of the Universal Father to the associated energies of matter, mind, and spirit and survives within the soul, In _The URANTIA Book_, "The term God always denotes personality." (4.5) Therefore, the personality of the Stpreme Being is inherent in God the Supreme who derives his personality from the Paradise Trinity.

In God the Supreme, spirit and personality are synonymous. Spirit and personality are two separate entities in our finite existence, but they are destined to become as one at the point of Adjuster fusion.

So, we have three circles of Supremacy: the growing power of the Almighty Supreme, the spirit personality of God the Supreme, and the Supreme Mind who holds together the power and personality attributes of Su premacy. The Supreme Mind functions as a mediator between the Almighty Supreme and God the Supreme on the finite level of reality just as the Universal Absolute is the mediator between the Unqualified Absolute and Deity Absolute on the infinite level of reality. And when these three circles come together and unite as one, we will witness the sovereignty of the Supreme Being, at the time when all seven superuniverses are settled in light and life.

The Supreme Being is finite and is an experiential Deity much in the same manner as man is an experiential creature. As man grows, so does the Supreme. Once we are able to impinge the circles of our existences upon the corresponding circles of Supremacy, we are on our way to achieving eternal destiny and at the same time assisting the Supreme in achieving destiny on deity levels,

"And so, as we strive for self-expression, the Supreme is striving in us, and with us, for deity expression. As we find the Father, so has the Supreme again found the Paradise Creator of all things. As we master the problems of self-realization, so is the God of experience achieving almighty supremacy in the universes of time and space," (1284.3)

## The Supreme Being A Definition

According to _The URANTIA Book_, the Supreme Being is an evolutionary Deity. He will have an eternal future but, unlike the Father, Son, and Spirit, he did have a beginning. At the present time he is not complete. He is evolving along with all of us and what we do has an influence on his evolution,

The best concise definition of the Supreme is as follows: "The Supreme Being is the unification of three phases of Deity reality: God the Supreme, the spiritual unification of certain finite aspects of the Paradise Trinity; the Almighty Supreme, the power unification of the grand universe Creators; and the Supreme Mind, the individual contribution of the Third Source and Center and his co-ordinates to the reality of the Supreme Being." (251.1)

God the Suprome is present right now in Havona, but is not contactible. We will not see him or speak to him when we are in Havona. Master Spirit Number Seven, our own Master Spirit, speaks for him. The principal purpose of our sojourn on the sixth circle of Havona is to get a deeper appreciation of God the Supreme through Master Spirit Number Seven. God the Supreme is now expanding outward in God the Sevenfold.

The Almighty Supreme is located in the superuniverses. He could not start evolving until they were in existence. His evolution depends upon the evolution of all the beings and all the physical parts of the superuniverses — the stabilization of power, both physical and administrative. He draws his very being from the acts of God the Sevenfold and the Sevenfold Controllers.

Supreme Mind, bestowed by the Infinite Spirit, coordinates God the Supreme, the spirit-personality part in Havona, and the Almighty Supreme, the powerevolutionary part in the superuniverses. Whenever spirit and matter exist together and work in combination, there has to be mind, to make it possible for the two to exist and get along together.

When all the superuniverses become settled in light and life, the Almighty Supreme, the power part, will be complete. And only then will the power part, the Almighty Supreme, and the spirit personality part, God the Supreme, unified by Supreme Mind, operate as one being, the Supreme Being — the completed, unified, evolutionary Deity, who will probably take up residence on Uversa, our superuniverse capital.

## Personal Growth: The Seven Psychic Circles

The article printed here is part of a paper presented at the Secand Central Atiantic Conference of LIRANTIA Book readers, Rockville, Maryland, on October 28, 1978.

Our total-personality growth — our progressive attainment of the seven psychic circles — is and must be immensely influenced by the types of mind and spirit ministry which other speakers are discussing today. From the seventh to the third circle our mindal growth involves ever-intensified functioning of the adjutant mind-spirits, the spirits of intuition, understanding, courage, knowledge, counsel, worship, and wisdom. The Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Truth foster our spiritual growth as we ascend the seven psychic circles. Further, we are told that "Circle by circle your intellectual decisions, moral choosings, and spiritual development add to the ability of the Adjuster to function in your mind; circle by circle you thereby ascend from the lower stages of Adjuster association and mind attunement, so that the Adjuster is increasingly enabled to register his picturizations of destiny with augmenting vividness and conviction upon the evolving consciousness of this God-seeking mindsoul." (1209.6)

Nevertheless, we are informed that most of us will hear the Adjuster's voice "seldom during a lifetime." (1213.5), and that "Human beings below the third and second circles of attainment rarely hear the Adjuster's direct voice except in moments of supreme desire, in a supreme situation, and consequent upon a supreme decision." (1213.5)

Seraphic ministry to us is directly related to circle attainment. When we reach the third circle we receive personal guardians, resulting in " . . an unmistakable improvement in all phases of cosmic achievement and spiritual development." (1210.9)

But all of this growth is for the benefit of others as well, not merely for our own personal satisfaction: "The universe is a whole; no thing or being exists or lives in isolation. Self-realization is potentially evil if it is antisocial. It is literally true: No man lives by himself.' Cosmic socialization constitutes the highest form of personality unification. Said Jesus: He who would be greatest among you, let him become server of all,." (647.6) If we truly desire to serve, our growth through the psychic circles will be of enhanced benefit to others: "The successful traversal of these levels demands the harmonious functioning of the entire personality..." (1209.4); and, as a result, "... circle attainment always augments the potential of human success and mortal achievement." (1211.5)

## Nature Of The Seven Psychic Circles

The exact nature of the seven psychic circles is highly personal. For each individual, the levels vary; they appear to be determined by each human being's capacity for growth. In any case these attainment levels relate to balanced growth of the whole person — growth in material, intellectual, and spiritual terms. Or, phrased in another way, the seven psychic circles have to do with personality status, mind attainment, soul growth, and Adjuster attunement. In yet another passage we are told that the seven psychic circles are levels of associated intellectual, social, spiritual, and cosmic-insight values.

All aspects of personal growth stould occur simultaneously, in proper proportion: "When the development of the intellectual nature proceeds faster than that of the spiritual, such a situation renders communication with the Thought Adjuster both difficult and dangerous. Likewise, overspiritual development tends to produce a fanatical and perverted interpretation of the spirit leadings of the divine indweller, Lack of spiritual capacity makes it very difficult to transmit to such a material intellect the spiritual truths resident in the higher superconsciousness. It is to the mind of perfect poise, housed in a body of clean habits, stabilized neural energies, and balanced chemical function — when the physical, mental, and spiritual powers are in triune harmony of development — that a maximum of light and truth can be imparted with a minimum of temporal danger or risk to the real welfare of such a being. By such a balanced growth does man ascend the circles of planctary progression one by one, from the seventh to the first." (1209.5)

A human being enters the seventh circle as a child (at about the age of five), when he or she learns the difference between right and wrong. At this point the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Truth function, and the Thought Adjuster arrives to indwell the mind.

The events which characterize entry into the sixth, fifth, and fourth circles are not described in _The URANTIA Book_. As previously mentioned, personal seraphic guardians are assigned upon a human being's entry into the third circle: "When a mortal mind breaks through the inertia of animal legacy and attains the third circle of human intellectuality and acquired spirituality..." ((1242.4) Another result of attaining the third circle is that the mortal acquires advanced standing, becoming qualified for repersonalization on the mansion worlds on the third day after natural death, rather than remain-
ing in the category of those who will be repersonalized in a dispensational or special resurrection.

The first circle "...represents the highest possible realization of mind-Adjuster relationship in the human experience prior to the liberation of the evolving morontia soul from the habiliments of the material body. Concerning mind, emotions, and cosmic insight, this achievement of the first psychic circle is the nearest possible approach of material mind and spirit Adjuster in human experience," (1210.10)

Let me pause here and confess that if it is perfectly clear to you just exactly what the seven psychic circles represent, then you have the advantage over me. Perhaps we could look at the seven psychic circles as embodying a human being's total potential for personal growth, Then, if we wanted to advance a rash speculation, we might say that each circle corresponds to oneseventh of each person's total potential. According to this model we would enter the third circle when we had already actualized four-sevenths of our human potential.

However, I very much doubt that the seven psychic circles divide total human potential into slices which are precisely equal in a mathematical sense. The model should not be pushed too far, but perhaps you will also find it useful.

More importantly, _The URANTIA Book_ suggests that we might understand the seven psychic circles as "...cosmic levels — actual meaning grasps and value realizations of progressive approach to the morontia consciousness of initial relationship of the evolutionary soul with the emerging Supreme Being," (1211.2) Thus, attainment of the psychic circles requires substantial effort on our part: "The motivation of faith makes experiential the full realization of man's sonship with God, but action, completion of decisions, is essential to the evolutionary attainment of consciousness of progressive kinship with the cosmic actuality of the Supreme Being. Faith transmutes potentials to actuals in the spiritual world, but potentials become actuals in the finite realms of the Supreme only by and through the realization of choice-experience." (1211.3) Or, to put this in simpler terms, we grow in the seven psychic circles by drawing close to God's plan for the evolution of our planet and the universe of universes; by making clear decisions which show our acceptance of our duty to serve; and by putting these decisions into action for the benefit of all. In the long run these life patterns lead to augmenting vision — man's " ... increased understanding of the world in which he lives; his enlarging capacity for the comprehension of the material facts of time, the meaningful ideas of thought, and the valuable ideals of spiritual insight." (1306.2) These same life patterns also eventually produce increasing control — "...the gradual accumulation of the knowledge of the laws of the material world, the purposes of spiritual existence, and the possibilities of the philosophic co-ordination of these two realities." (1306.3)

To conclude our discussion of the nature of the seven circles, it is important for us to understand that we have plenty of time to achieve them: either in this life or in the next: "Though the cosmic circles of personality growth must eventually be attained, if, through no fault of your own, the accidents of time and the handicaps of material existence prevent your mastering these levels on your native planet, if your intentions and desires are of survival value, there are issued the decrees of probation extension. You will be afforded additional time in which to prove yourself." (1233.3)

## In The Future...

We would like to devote an issue to the examination of the differences in origin, function, and destiny of the various personalities who authored the papers in _The URANTIA Book_. These differences often color the writings assigned to each personality, and we hope that such a study will enable us to know the individual writer and the respective class of individuals better. Let us know if you are interested in contributing.

The editors

"True it is, you mortals are of earthly, animal origin; your frame is indeed dust. But if you actually will, if you really desire, surely the heritage of the ages is yours, and you shall someday serve throughout the universes in your true characters — children of the Supreme God of experience and divine sons of the Paradise Father of all personalities."
