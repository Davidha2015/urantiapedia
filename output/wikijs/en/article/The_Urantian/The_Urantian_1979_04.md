## The Identification Process

_The URANTIA Book_ reveals that our personality is of such a majestic grandeur that, unchanged, it can function even on the borders of the absolute! (1226) That same personality which we have now does not evolve to that unimaginable level, nor grow up to it. Personality remains unchanged.

To reconcile this supernal truth with reality as we know it, it seems inevitable to conclude that personality does not know itself, or, at least, only very incompletely. And it takes all that long, long time, and even more than time, for personality to get that actual self-knowledge and attain that level of self-realization where it can be truly said: i am that i am. (Capitals would be presumptuous here.) Even the authors of _The URANTIA Book_ are not sure if there is such a finality for a son of an Infinite Father.

## Secret Of Evolution

To attain true self-realization is "the secret of evolution. "The attainment plan of the Father is based on selfrealization through experience, and this involves the identification-process. The majestic personality that does not know itself is bestowed on an evolutionary living organism that includes mind, and is of animal origin.

Through lack of self-knowledge this primitive beginning of self-consciousness must necessarily take the form of identification with the organism. And without such a full identification to start from, it would be hardly possible to live this life of action in and reaction to the environment.

We can observe this in a child, " . . . before a child has developed sufficiently to acquire moral capacity and therefore to be able to choose altruistic service, he has already developed a strong and well-unified egoistic nature." (1131.9) This strong and well-united nature appears to be a necessity as a good stronghold to start out from for getting self-knowledge on a higher level: "When the growing child fails of personality unification, the altruistic drive may become so overdeveloped as to work serious injury to the welfare of the self. A misguided conscience can become responsible for much conflict, worry, sorrow, and no end of human unhappiness." (1132.1) Something for parents and educators to be aware of.

With the arrival of the Thought Adjuster a new phase in the identification process begins. Personality unification and moral capacity have been sufficiently acquired to add the drive of the Thought Adjuster for making altruistic decisions. This process of change has to be very gradual so as not to distupt the personality-unification. A mentally healthy child can without harm to himself venture out upon this expansion of the identificationprocess. He discovers that the altruistic drive also belongs to his nature.

Now a child cannot remain a child, Growth is a natural process, but though natural and unconscious, it needs to be fostered, on the material as well as on the intellectual and spiritual levels. The higher the level, the greater the need for this fostering. On the spiritual level the best way to do this is our dedicated seeking for and doing of the Father's will. The growth processes are related to the identification process. Growth is unconscious, identification is more conscious. They mutually influence each other, If, for example, identification with life on the material level and its duties is shunned, growth is stopped. Growing persons are loyal persons.

## Normal Growth

But even in the normal growth process of the child the initially achieved unification of personality-identity is challenged again and again by discovery of new factors that also may be part of that mysterious, inexhaustible personality, in which everything already potentially exists, but not experientially. Such factors, before being integrated in the identity, often manifest themselves in a feeling of lacking something, in uncertainty and anxiousness. As these new factors in experience are integrated, the center of the identity, the seat of the "I," moves upwards, Initially it was located in the material mind, now it begins to move to the intellectual mind, and it may move upwards to the spiritual mind. This means that man recognizes values in the intellectual and spiritual domain. "Where your treasures are, there your heart will be." The ego gradually changes into selfhood.

So the identity is in a process of continual change. Life is in a way a discovery expedition into the unknown, but fascinating, domain of personality with its endless potentials. But this expedition goes mostly over rough ground. And progress is mostly not in a straight line either, it may even change into regression. Mortal life is a short, but relatively severe, testing period. However, the loving Father has provided help and guidance. Besides the many spirit influences around and with us, there is the Father fragment, the Mystery Monitor, that indwells us.

We might interpret this name in different ways: the Monitor that constitutes a mystery in itself; the Monitor that enters into a mysterious relationship with a mortal mind; and in our context we might also say, the entity that monitors us in the mystery of its own nature and in the mystery of the nature of our true personality and in their relationship.

Anyway, its influence on the identity is great. With its arrival the soul comes into existence, though in embryonical state. I think we should not consider the soul to be a change in the old identity, but as the creation of a new (embryonic) identity, in the sense that now there are two identities. This is a paradoxical situation, characterized by divergent urges and giving rise to much struggle in decision making. Which values are more valuable, are more real? Which identity is more real?

Birth of the soul is not equivalent to rebirth, the prerequisite for entering the kingdom of heaven. The soul that comes into existence when the Thought Adjuster arrives is not yet immortal. The soul also can die. (see pg.(1229.9) Rebirth, being a spiritual phenomenon, can hardly be defined intellectually. But an essential factor in rebirth is conscious identification with the soul, "The personality of the mortal creature may, eternalize by self-identification with the indwelling spirit through the technique of choosing to do the will of the Father." (1295.2) Though this may sometimes happen as an apparent sudden breakthrough, it most times is a process.

And the identification process, the upward shifting of the center or seat of identity, goes on. On the morontia worlds the soul becomes the vehicle of life, even as mind was on the material plane. "Mind is your ship, the Adjuster is your pilot, the human will is captain." (1217.5) The soul is the seat of identity of both the human personality and the Thought Adjuster, who also partakes in its own way in the identification process. I speculate that these soul-identities gradually overlap until fusion is attained.

And then the long preparation begins for acquiring a spirit-vehicle. The seat of identity has to be shifted still upwards into the spirit-energy system. Mind, instead of being a spiritual mind, becomes a true spirit mind. When we leave the local universe no longer a body or form will be provided, but the ascendant spirit is capable of projecting his own spirit form.

When will this identification process end? Does it go on when this universe age of the Supreme will be succeeded by the age of the Ultimate? And after that? Will there ever be an end? We don't know and can only speculate. But even speculation on this far distant and utterly foreign situation seems to be not very profitable. Anyhow, a majestic career lies before us. The important thing to do now is to identify ourselves more and more with our soul. Growth is fostered by "sincerity, more sincerity, and by more sincerity." Identification is fostered by "decisions, more decisions, and by more decisions." (435.8) ldentification with the soul means cooperation with the co-parent of the soul, our Fatherfriend within. The Mystery Monitor is the will of the Father. We cannot do the will of the Father without communication with the Monitor, and we cannot communicate with the Monitor without doing the Father's will, How can a child prosper if there is no communication between the parents? How can the soul prosper if there is no communication between its two parents, the mortal mind and the Adjuster? If we honestly and sin-
cerely seck that communion in loving prayer and worship we may not hear his voice, may not even feel his presence, but if we are alert, we shall surely discover the results of such communion.

## Interpreting Universe Reality

All reality has but One Centered Source, the Universal Father, the pre-reality of the I AM. The manifested time-space realities of matter, mind, and spirit display a spectrum of varied and interpenetrating levels of reality. But each level of reality, each form of manifestation, is centered and grounded in a corresponding, perfect Paradise reality which controls and upholds the sustained creativity of God.

We may perceive our progress through such a universe toward the original realms of perfection and eternity as one which progressively transcends material levels, traverses mindal levels, and achieves spirit levels. We may alternatively see evolution as the process by which spirit gains control and ascendancy over matter through the mediation of mind.

A third interpretation is one in which the manifestations of matter, mind, and spirit are being displayed equally before a witnessing consciousness which at some point discovers or realizes that it is identified with a non-evolving. perfect, divine entity which exists as a fragmentation of that Deity reality which is pre-existent and ancestral to all matter-mind-spirit differentiation and manifestation.

Another and subsequent interpretation of universe reality is one in which all manifestations are regarded as realizations of personality thought, by both Creators and creatures, co-creators. In this view of reality, perfection of manifestation is attendant upon simultaneous, perfect, creative, unison thinking by all personalities, or by a sufficiently large segment of such personalities as shall be able to precipitate perfection. The rectification and perfection of creative thinking could proceed most swiftly, if a clear example of right thinking and perfect manifestation consequences were effectively and appreciably demonstrated to a sufficient number of creature personalities.

## Divine Outreach

A corollary interpretation of the progressive realizations of universe evolution would be one which is complemental to this last concept. The progress of the demonstration of the perfectability of all subabsolute manifestations by right thinking on the part of both Creator and creature intellects is foreknown by the Om niscient and All-foreseeing Mind of God. The readiness of creatures to appreciate the precipitability of improved and even of perfect realities is designed by prioreternal Creator reality coordination to coincide with the cyclic interrelationships of universal matter, mind, and spirit (and with the Absolute Sources and means of their manifestation), so that a new outreaching of Divine Paradise realities arrives within a certain sector of the universe at a time and place at which creature consciousness is most appropriately prepared to coordinate with such advanced and unprecedented manifestations of Perfection,

Another interpretation of universe creativity derives from the recognition that all time-space creativity exists as a present reality within the timeless, eternal Mind of God. All ranges of perfection and so-called imperfection manifestation possibilities may be regarded as existing simultaneously in the Mind of Eternity. The Mind of God is manifesting this range of actualizable realitics in the sequences of time in the domains of space. The appropriateness of the timing for the manifestation of perfect realities would be governed principally by the readiness of creature consciousness to relate to such realities. To take this interpretation one step further, one might suggest that all manifestations are but the varied projections of inherently perfect realities before an imperfection-perceiving mentality of time-space creatures, As soon as creature apprehension and comprehension capacity is such that it can relate to perfect manifestations, the projections of reality shall appear to change so as to correlate with the improved capability discernment. Such an alteration of the intent and actuality of reality projection in time and space would result in the immediate precipitation of perfection realities in the evolutionary domains. It may be suggested that creativity in time is a means of enhancing and increasing creature appreciation for the values of Perfection, as well as providing a means of demonstrating the nature of the Infinite Love and Perfection of God within the limited relativities of time-space finitude, for the edification of all subinfinite personalities.

## God Identification

All of these foregoing interpretations of universe reality may be transcended through the present realization of a given personality's inherent qualities and elements of Perfection and Eternity. All time-space actuali-
zations become but a passing show — a finite revelation of Infinite facts, meanings, and values — to one who has boldly laid claim to his presently possessed endowments of eternal Perfection. This transcending of time-space manifestations is possible for any personality who has identified himself with God's etemal consciousness and perspective, the viewpoint of his indwelling fragment of God. We may say that such a personality may transcend time and space realities through the discovery of his identifiability with God and Eternal Reality NOW. Our most essential selfhood components comprise an eternal fragment of Divinity and an eternalizable, unique personality. The personality which identifies himself with the associated fragment of God, or which discovers his utter non-identifiability with anything or anyone else, may achieve the eternal perspective-he may proceed to the appropriate recognition that all of Infinity eternally NOW IS, and IS Perfect, any and all subabsolute manifestations, fluctuations, and appearances to the contrary notwithstanding.

## Underlying Unity

Such an interpreting personality may discover the unalterable absolute unity which underlies all transient universe manifestations. His indwelling fragment of God is at one with that absoluteness. His personality, like that of the Father, transcends absoluteness and universe reality manifestations inherently. His unified selfhood of absolute reality and personality is at one with the timeless, spaceless, motionless boundlessness of the I AM. Subsequent to such a discovery, each passing moment would be perceived by such a personality as existing as an equally valid Eternity-perception moment, another time-space stop moment in the non-moving, ever-existent NOWness of Eternity, in which all Infinity remains unchanged, immutable, and perfect. When such a consciousness turns itself to the activity of universe contemplation and creative reality thinking, it unerringly results in perfection precipitation as a cocreational force united with the Father's creative prerogatives within the domain of the universe thus related to and concerned. Such is a precept for the progressive perfection of universe reality, duplicating in time and space the eternal patterns of Paradise Perfection, and the Personality Perfection of the Universal Father.

The I AM first fragments as unphasable, distinct entities, proceeds to the creative and evolutionary realization of a cosmic environment and creature personalities, and then, as the Father, bestows the perfect Divinity entities upon his humblest of creatures, men, thereby endowing them with the destiny possibility of attaining consciousness of and identity with the Infinity of the Original I AM. The process of the creation, progressions and perfection of these creature beings is the activity and motion of time; the anytime identity of any freely God-choosing mortal with the all-transcendent perfection of the I AM is an eternal and everlasting, nonabrogatable reality NOW. In time, much becomes; in eternity, all is — is perfect and is one. The eternal Infinity of the I AM is the maximum conceptual paradox for creature comprehension capacities: Eternal Infinity is Limitless Diversity existing simultaneously as Infinite Unity. Nonetheless, so all is, and all includes us, in Eternity, NOW. Such a reality, while philosophically paradoxical, is nevertheless susceptible of creature intuition and validation through the experiential discovery of absolute unity with Infinity: personal sonship with God.

— Drvid Glass

"Sooner or later all universe personalities begin to realize that the final quest of eternity is the endless exploration of infinity, the never-ending voyage of discovery into the absoluteness of the First Source and Center. Sooner or later we all become aware that all creature growth is proportional to Father identification."
