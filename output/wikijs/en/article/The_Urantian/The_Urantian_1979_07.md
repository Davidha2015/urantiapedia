## Journal Of URANTIA Brotherhood

## Ganid Of India

Students of _The URANTIA Book_ know well the many and varied forms of spiritual energy which the Father has provided so that someday we will come to know and be like him. One of the most inspiring points to this reader has been the description of those heroic mortals of Urantia who have dared to live as sons and daughters of the Father in faith.

One human who has been of personal interest from my first reading of _The URANTIA Book_ is Ganid of India. This young man instantly impressed me with his genuine desire for truth without prejudice and his almost innocent sense of wonder at the things he and the Master discussed and accomplished. Also, I must admit, I get a bit jealous when I think of his experience being Jesus' intimate friend for over a year and a half.

Ganid is introduced to us as a young man in search of answers. At first he was primarily interested in science and the arts; he had no discernible thought toward spiritual truths. But at Caesarea, only their second stop on the way to Rome, he became curious about his tutor's ministry: "Why do you occupy yourself so continuously with these visits with strangers?" (1431.1) This question must have produced a smile when he remembered it in later life. It brought about a meeting which changed his life — a conference with Joshua the teacher in which he began to learn of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of all men.

It was at the very next port of call, Alexandria, that Ganid began the brilliant summary of the world's religions for which we remember him most. His manuscript "... was preserved in India for hundreds of years after his death." (1442.2) Obviously, Jesus had turned Ganid into an eager student in this short time. (Ganid's enthusiasm recalls my first serious contact with _The URANTIA Book_. Like many readers, I became anxious to study it as much as possible in as short a time as was possible.) Ganid learned these teachings well, for Jesus told him that " '. . you, my son, will be like this lighthouse when you return to India... you will become like the light of life to those who sit about you in darkness, showing all who so desire the way to reach the harbor of salvation in safety.' " And as Ganid squeezed Jesus' hand, he said "'I will.' " (1432.3)

While in Rome, Ganid was an assistant to the Master as he went among his people. One day they were on the way to the library, as these two would be on every possible occasion. But this time, they immediately abandoned the visit to return a lost boy to his home. Ganid, in contrast to our previous views of him, did not hesitate in devoting his day to the boy's welfare. He had begun to live the life of a faith son. "And from that day forward, for the remainder of his natural life, Ganid was continually on the lookout for lost children woom he might restore to their homes," (1465.5) What better definition of spiritual service can we need?

## Lessons In Mercy

It often takes a dramatic situation in life to bring a deeper understanding of the ideals to which a faith son or daughter is committed. The violent incidents at Fair Havens and near Tarentum, and the meeting with the women of Corinth were lessons that mercy is needed where punishment would normally be given. Even many of Jesus' followers today find the meaning of non-resistance unsettling: even though millions claim to believe his teaching on this subject, there is very little evidence of mass practice.

By the time Ganid and Jesus parted, the young man's total devotion to his Master and his teaching had ripened. In Antioch, Ganid had put his beliefs into action by talking to a disheartened man about the Father's love. He told Jesus. " '1 will remembir your teaching, but most of all, I will never forget you." " (1481.6) he told Jesus. He was true to this promise.

When I remember Ganid, the trait that always comes to mind is his curiosity. It is this — the admirable manner in which he sincerely pursued the truth, wherever it might be, without letting preconceived thoughts stop his progress — that speaks to me most when I run into my mind's own obstacles on the long search for the Father. It is important to be constantly hungering for the source of truth, beauty, and goodness. Only by avoiding this staleness in a life dedicated to spiritual truth, staleness which can only lead to stagnation and decay, will the

Adjuster be allowed to foster growth. As Jesus directed the natural inquisitiveness of Ganid in the direction of universal values, Gonod, his father, remarked: "I propose to make a scholar or a businessman of my son, and now you start out to make a philosopher or philanthropist of him.' And Jesus smilingly replied: Perhaps we will make him all four; then can he enjoy a fourfold satisfaction in life as his ear for the recognition of human melody will be able to recognize four tones instead of one." (1465.7) What more could anyone ask for than to become a "four tone" person like Ganid?

## The Matchless Moses

While Ikhnaton was remarkable, Moses was matchless. "Despite the enticements of the culture of the Nile kingdom, Moses elected to cast his lot with the people of his father... No leader ever undertook to reform and uplift a more forlorn, downcast, dejected, and ignorant group of human beings," (1055.6,7) This magnificent world teacher dreamed and realized an impossible dream. Moses chose the low road of forty years of watchful waiting that resulted in the glorious, dramatic rescue of an apparently hopeless people and in the savings of their

His life work was characterized by a high standard of excellence and a multi-faceted ability in problem-solving. A Melchizedek described him as being the single "... most important individual world teacher and leader between the times of Machiventa and Jesus," (1057.7) A midwayer listed Moses as one of seven of the world's most outstanding human teachers. He was a versatile and adaptable master of human behavior. He combined skills of military leadership, religious teaching, and social organization. This extraordinary set of talents resulted from his successful ust of inherited traits. His parentage was an Egyptian-Semitic union, stemrning from a highly mixed racial ancestry of good sources, "Had he not been of this mixed type, he would never have displayed that unusual versatility and adaptability which enabled him to manage the diversified horde which eventually became ..." known as the people of Israel, (1055.5) Moses was a grand example of what is possible with a hybrid racial mixture based on sound, healthy, superior antecedent biological qualities.

His greatness was achieved by striking a balance between the ideal and the practical. One readily admires the heroic qualities in Moses. But one is moved by the charm of his wisdom, meekness, and faith. He earned respect by matching his actions with his words. Yet, this man of strong purpose knew how to compromise. He was a forceful leader who took the long view. He had a strong mind coupled with a tender heart. He placed work-importance over self-importance. He was sensitive and responsive to real human needs. He made a lasting contribution to the evolution of religion by accommodating the best of the primitive beliefs about God held by his people with the more advanced concepts of God that he offered them. He wisely nationalized his religious teachings. "Other men have had greater concepts of God, but no one man was ever so successful in inducing large numbers of people to adopt such advanced beliefs," (1009.6)

The bottom line for Moses was the saving faith that can find a way where there is no way, Moses knew that when a person searches for God, he searches for everything: when he finds God, he has found everything. Moses was bold enough to act on the answers to his prayers. The faith of Moses expanded his mind, ennobled his soul, reinforced his personality, augmented his happiness, deepened his spiritual perception, and enhanced his power to love and be loved.

## Quiet Human Heroes

URANTIA Book readers are aware of the outstanding performance of Van and Amadon during the seven crucial years immediately following the Caligastia betrayal of Urantia, One is deeply impressed with Amadon because of his sincere portrayal of total loyalty to his immediate associates and superiors who in turn remained loyal to Michael and our Universal Father. The out. standing leadership of Van and Amadon is attested to by their retention on Urantia for work after the translation of the thirty-nine remaining faithful members of the corporeal staff and fifty-five of their modified associates at the end of the seven years of uncertainty coincident with the arrival of the Melchizedek receivers.

Van and Amadon were to continue their labors here for about another 162,000 years or until shortly after the arrival of Adam and Eve, In their enterprises they were loyally assisted by a band of Andonites, originally eighty-eight in number who together with their descendants became known as Amadonites. Despite this name, a cultural-religious designation, they "... were essentially Andonites." ('822:1) Beyond being informed of their presence in Dalamatia at the outbreak of rebellion, we know little of their level of education, intellectual, or religious development. We know they were totally mortal, hence by our present day concepts, relatively youthful, in all probability. We can assume they were quite primitive and short-lived.

If we compare them with the members of the corporeal staff of the prince and their original one hundred modified Andonite associates, startling differences appear.

The one hundred members of the corporeal staff were material but superhuman beings whose souls had been transplanted into human bodies fabricated for the purpose, and into which had been implanted a portion of the life plasm taken from each of one hundred Andonite donors. Previous to arrival on Urantia they had been provisional citizens of ascendant status on Jerusalem and had been personally selected by Caligastia. One fact stands out. None had fused with their Adjusters. Each was a one-time mortal, and none were from the same planet,

At the time the one hundred Andonites donated a portion of their life plasm, the Life Carriers introduced into each Andonite donor body..." the complement of the system circuits..." (745.6) This was a very practical consideration. It enabled these modified Andonites to live on and on with the members of the corporeal staff and thus preserve their accumulating life experiences as attendants to the latter. At the outbreak of the rebellion, each had accumulated 300,000 years of close experience with the personalities of Dalamatia

It is not given to us in our present life circumstances to see or listen to the speech of a brilliant Lanonandek Son, We thus have no concept of their high intelligence or intellectual fluidity, their sophisticated logic or rationale or argumentative assests. That all of these must be outstanding is only too well illustrated by the fact that Caligastia and Daligastia were able to use their talents so well in the perversion of their universe responsibilities to ensnare 60 members of their corporeal staff and 44 modified Andonites in their web of deceit and treason to all.

By contrast, the work of Van and Amadon in keeping 88 totally mortal Andonites from rebellion stands out, considering the tremendous odds which they faced, including those incorporated by the presence of Lucifer as head of the opposition.

The purpose of this writing, however, is to give highly honorable recognition to the 88 simple, primitive, mostly unlettered, certainly quite ignorant by our standards. men and women of the Andonite band who remained faithful. They remained so in the face of defection of 44 of their own highly favored tribesmen and tribeswomen and 60 of the superhuman corporeal staff and despite the impressive, brilliant intelligence and authoritative stances of Caligastia and Daligastia, with all their sophistries and rationalizations. Truly quict human heroes. We will someday look for the portrayal of their courage and fidelity on the panoramic history exhibitions on Jerusalem.

## Norana

The Norana episode is a gem of a story and could be compared to a dramatic one-act play. Norana and Jesus are the stars with the others as supporting players.

Norana's great love for her afflicted daughter could be compared to Jesus' great love for mankind. Nor were the apostles without love. They loved Jesus and were trying to protect him from intrusion, but they did not yet share his love for mankind.

Norana upset them, She was as determined to see Jesus as they were to protect him. She did not show proper respect for the ecclesiastical authority, their racial superiority or even their masculine superiority. I wonder if they would have been as rude to a Gentile man? At any rate, she irked them. Yet she herself was not discouraged by their rudeness.

If one were to rewrite the story, how could the apostles behavior be improved? Would they deal more kindly with mother and child, perhaps pray for the child, or even go and tell Jesus about the problem? But they were
confused about many of Jesus' teachings, and he was able to use this happening as an object lesson.

There must be something we can learn from this, whether we find ourselves in the position of the apostles or the mother. Can we refrain from taking ourselves too seriously even while taking the gospel seriously?

Norana's sense of humor appealed to Jesus for he too had a sense of humor and he was sorry that his apostles had so little of it, though they could be of good cheer when things were going well.

When an apostle referred to her as a Gentile "dog," Norana retorted that she was at least "a believing dog." (1735.2)

Jesus was listening, unseen, to all this interchange. Surely we, too, have unseen listeners as we play our parts in the play that has been running since free will appeared on our earth.

Though Norana played a sympathetic part, she was not without fault. She had been informed that Jesus needed rest. And he asked her to tell no one about her daughter's healing. But she heeded none of this. Both Norana and her daughter proclaimed the news of the healing throughout the area. So great became the commotion that Jesus and his associates were forced to change plans and move elsewhere.

This brings to mind the life plans our Thought Adjusters have made for each of us and how our not listening to them may cause them to change their plans for us, always with the same goal in mind, Surely, changing plans has long been the story on this "world of the cross."

## The Apostle Andrew

We read of many admirable human beings in _The URANTIA Book_, but my favorite has always been the apostle Andrew. While I can respect his innate intelli- gence and administrative ability, I am most drawn to that quality of human understanding that he possessed; and I am convinced that this was his most outstanding character achievement.

Perhaps because he understood them so well, Andrew was an expert judge of men. In the most momentous decision of his life, he approached Jesus and offered to follow him, before Jesus even asked him. Immediately thereafter, he brought Simon Peter to Jesus and was responsible for keeping him with the apostolic corps, Andrew was the only apostle to suspect that there was a problem with Judas long before the actual betrayal. But "Andrew's great service to the kingdom was in advising Peter, James, and John concerning the choice of the first missionaries... and also in counseling these early leaders about the organization of the administrative affairs of the kingdom." (1549.7)

I have often wondered if Andrew ever regretted not being able to enjoy the close companionship with Jesus that Peter, James and John had, If so, there is no evidence of it. He consistently demonstrated patience; he was stable, a well-rounded personality.

And he must have been easy to talk to. The apostles sought his counsel and guidance frequently. Someday I would like to talk to Andrew myself, and I look forward to meeting him during the morontia career.
