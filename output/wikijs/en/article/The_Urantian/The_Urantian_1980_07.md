## The Seraphic Connection

One function of revelation is to sort out, clarify, and emphasize the truths which have evolved over the years as men seck to harmonize what they know and what they can believe. Angels have been a part of religious revelation, evolution, tradition, myth, and legend for thousands of years. Some of the most interesting narratives in _The URANTIA Book_ deal with the relationship or connection between mortals and angels.

Seraphim, being the closest to us during our mortal existence, are our guardians, companions, inspiration, and conservators of the best we have achieved individually and as a planet. _The URANTIA Book_ describes the particular relationship of guardian seraphim and the efforts of the master seraphim or planetary supervisors. We read that while they can't implant new or better ideas or concepts in our minds, they often act to intensify a higher ideal someone has already conceived. They also train and mobilize the reserve corps of destiny.

The question I have after reading this is, how do they do it? One of the intriguing results of revelation is that it leaves us asking as many questions as it answers. This, of course, is the way it's meant to be. I think I see the results of the seraphic efforts in history, especially in the last 1900 years since the universal bestowal of Thought Adjusters.

We have often heard the expression that this or that person is on the side of the angels. I wonder if perhaps in many cases the angels aren't on the side of an individual. Consider someone who in an ordinary way starts with an idea or ideal and by staying with his conviction and building upon it changes the course of history.

Martin Luther, seeking the way to salvation, was convinced that faith, not good works, was the answer. Before he was through, he and his fellow reformers had shaken the church of Rome to the core. The Reformation forced the church to begin its own counter-reformation.

Angelo Roncalli served the world as Pope John XXIII for such a brief period, but as he put it, during that time he opened the windows of the Vatican and let in some fresh air, The conservative members of the church have done their best since to close the windows, but they don't realize that it's too late.

These are only two of thousands of examples of history where results have far exceeded initial intent, Is it circumstance, happenstance, or coincidence, or have the seraphim of our planetary guardianship been successful in intensifying the higher ideals of those involved? I don't know, but I believe the seraphim have helped our progress in these and thousands of other instances. I believe they continue to help us in ways we can't realize or comprehend.

“Keep on keeping on”

In writing recently about God the Supreme, my mother once said the important thing seemed to be to “keep on keeping on,” in other words, to hang in there, to continue our best efforts or ideas as we see them. There is something in the universe, the seraphic connection, that, if you will, will intensify these efforts and bring about the best results for all concerned. We may not recognize the results as such, or even live to see them: but faith assures that, with help from our unseen friends, things work out for good. This is the meaning of the morontia mota, “The act is ours; the consequences God's.” (556.13)

In the early days of the dissemination of The URANTlA Book and its teachings, its spread has been slow but increasingly certain. I'm sure the seraphim are assisting the true efforts of all the individuals concerned with the movement. With such help we are assured of success. I'm also convinced that the long-term result of the URANTIA revelation, when viewed as history sometime in the future, will be greater than any involved with the movement in these very early days can foresee. I believe the seraphic connection will continue and will add to our efforts. As people become more willing to follow their higher ideas, religiously, politically, and socially, there is nothing that can't be attempted and eventually accomplished.

## Lindbergh The Angelic Influence

Guided, guarded, inspired, and assisted as we all are by the seraphim assigned to our watch-care, certain highly endowed and motivated mortals can also be involved in the plans and projects of the master seraphim whose activities are directed by the resident governor general on Urantia. The extent of this involvement probably depends primarily upon their origins and choices. Although the method of selection may be somewhat obscure, the lives of certain individuals stand out like beacons casting beams of influence and power across the planet. Such a person was Charles Lindbergh.

Lindbergh's influence upon aviation from 1927 when he made his historic flight across the Atlantic until his death in 1974 may have involved the angels of progress, nation life, the races, the future, industry, and diversion. And many could have been the conferences scheduled to handle the overlapping influences and consequences of his various endeavors. The watchword may even have been, “And what of Lindbergh?...” Imagine the farreaching effects of his friendships and contacts as they brought the rulers of various countries together, the interchange of trade and finance, the inventions of industry, the mixing of peoples and cultures, the stimulation of travel and change, and the general education and training resulting from this activity in this field alone. This is not to mention his very considerable contribution in the fields of genetics, pollution, conservation, surveying, endangered species, medicine, wilderness ex-

ploration, and writing. He also served for long periods as an advisor to various industries and governments.

How was all this progressive activity guided and compressed into one short lifetime? One can only assume intensive effort and coordination on the part of his Thought Adjuster, guardian seraphim, and the master seraphim concerned, Lindbergh himself gives an answer in his Autobiography of Values, an excellent firsthand account of the sum and substance of his public life. For inner guidance, the implementation of plans, and the solution of his problems he turned to “...thought during driving, followed by a night's sleep, Obviously some rational process, of which my conscious mind was unaware, took place under such circumstance. Because the results were so consistent, I came to rely on the process.” Lindbergh described communication with his Thought Adjuster as “withdrawing to your core” and asserted that it brought him “closer to values of life and death.” It is significant that toward the end of his life he began to realize that his interests were shifting from the scientific to the mystical because he had learned that any science “pursued to its peripheries ended in mystery.”

## Company In The Cockpit

Describing his solo flight across the Atlantic in The Spirit of St. Louis he actually tells of two shining beings that hovered on either side of him in the tiny cockpit, giving advice and comfort. Even though subsequently he remembered no word they had said, he never forgot their beauty, and although consciously he was largely unaware of seraphic ministry, the evidence of his life and accomplishments is ample proof that such a ministry existed and demonstrates what can be achieved when man willingly attunes himself to the wavelengths of the angels.

Since Lindbergh died in 1974, it is not an invasion of his privacy to suggest he was in the reserve corps of destiny, He was certainly a pivotal individual because of his wide exposure to world leaders, national and industrial as well as the arts, and due to his expertise in many fields and high mobility, it was possible for him to be attached in a working capacity to ten or twelve worldwide projects at any given period of his adult life.

His ability to conquer time and achieve space was outstanding for a “lowly” mortal. In order to concentrate on the mindal and spiritual aspects of life he developed a technique for divesting himself of the drag of material possessions. He would package, catalog, and store them — he called this his “brown-package policy.”

Another technique he employed for getting in touch
with higher guidance is described in some detail: “A quality of 'time' rides with travel which I have found under no other circumstances. It fertilizes subconscious (read superconscious) apprehension until visions emerge like — but more rational than — the visions brought forth by the quality of time that lies in sleep. Memory and imagination act on a stage of thought improvising practical and fantastic roles. I daydream of impossibilities and lay plans of action to approach them, and, still further, plans to implement plans.” He might even be describing the activities of the master seraphim who are “... ideational clearinghouses, mind focalizers, and project promoters.” (1256.10)

He retained his enthusiasm and dedication to making this world a better place for posterity to the very end of his life, stating. “The farther we penetrate the unknown, the vaster and more marvelous it becomes.” And this above all — he was a man of ACTION who left many footprints on the sands of his time.

## Renewing And Revitalizing Society

On page(2082.8 of _The URANTIA Book_ it says:

“Urantia is now quivering on the very brink of one of its most amazing and enthralling epochs of social readjustment, moral quickening, and spiritual enlightenment.”

1 believe it. And this is quite a challenge, being asked to talk about renewing and revitalizing society — even with _The URANTIA Book_ as a point of reference.

Even as I say this, I realize that it would be an impossible challenge for me without _The URANTIA Book_. For twenty-five years it has been the measure against which I hold all the wonderful bits and pieces of information that come to me as I read philosophy, psychology, biology, and physics. Without this marvelous revelation, my ability to absorb new understandings would have been severely limited. With it, I read, and my heart leaps up in recognition of truths and I keep saying. “Of course! Of course!”

It has always seemed of prime importance to me to keep informed to whatever degree is possible about what is going on in the world. A lot is going on out there that would have been completely foreign to the world into which _The URANTIA Book_ was introduced.
So l'd like to talk a little about the renewing and revitalizing of society that has taken place since then, as well as what's going on now and what may be possible in our future.

## The Beginning Of Transformation

I can only speak for myself, of course, but at that time, twenty-five years ago, there was almost no way that you could talk about _The URANTIA Book_ to anyone except your most intimate friends and some members of your family. Even in the church, or most particularly in the church, you were looked at askance if you produced it, or tried to explain it. Actually I was a Johnny-come-lately to the fold myself, having had an 'experience' a couple of years earlier that had changed me from a Unitarian to a URANTIA Book Trinitarian. It was a stress-related experience of being warmly enclosed in light and deep love, with a certain and sudden knowing and understanding of all the religious puzzlements that go with intellectualism. It's the experience that in _The URANTIA Book_ is mentioned as one you can never explain to a person who hasn't had it, in some form, and which you don't need to explain to the person who has had it. I tell you about it, because I think it is the real beginning of transformation. In fact it is my thesis that the prerequisite of the renewing and revitalizing of society is the change, first, in many persons. Without it, you are trying to get a butterfly by pinning wings on a caterpiller.

Well, the only person that changed around me in those early years was my brother, David, who was then religion editor of the Chicago Daily News. He'd heard about God, of course, but that was about all. As he read the book, he had the great opportunity to meet often with Dr. Sadler, and many of his newspaper articles were based on _The URANTIA Book_ teachings. Another light went on for me in the mid-sixties when I went with David to interview Joel Goldsmith, the founder of the Infinite Way. I read his books, delighted to find 'out there' some corroboration of what I felt so strongly in here,' At the same time, doing the final laps in rearing four children, alone, I felt keenly the predicament of Paul who couldn't understand why he did the things he shouldn't and didn't do the things he should. I heard about a new kind of thing called Gestalt Therapy and I got my school board (I was teaching kindergarten at the time) to pay the $600 for weekly group sessions for six months so that I could develop “leadership qualities.” I found both good and bad in it. The good came as I cleared away a lot of debris in my personal life, the bad as I became aware of the damage a careless use of this technique could cause. But much more good than bad,

I'd say. The success or failure of any psychotechnology to do more than shore up weak structures depends, it seems to me, upon whether the person has, or acquires during therapy, some sense of religious identity — Godin-me — that leads to love and service, rather than just an enhancement of the ME-ME-ME that leads to selfgratification,

## True Self Development

I think it is a mistake to down-play the importance of “self-development” — true self-development. Without it we continue to work for change in the same old ways that barely keep us afloat. Real changes come when people are different, when they become less fearful, less judgemental, more trusting of the goodness and friendliness of the universe. When we see each other in new ways we become aware of our connectedness, of our brotherhood.

Marilyn Ferguson, in “The Aquarian Conspiracy.” a book you must read, says about this kind of experience: “By increasing our awareness of inner signals, the psychotechnologies promote a sense of vocation, an inner direction awaiting discovery and release. Things begin to happen in our lives... when an individual has solved his problems, when he is ready to meet the world with imagination and energy, things fall in place — a collaboration between person and events that seems to enlist the cooperation of fate. Carl Jung called this phenomenon ”synchronicity."

“This phenomenon sounds mystical only because we do not understand it. But there are innumerable clues available given the right frame of mind — openness the availability to synthesize the clues into the whole.”

1 have never forgotten the moon shot when I heard a countdown that went from 10 to 3 and then ended with the words, “guidance is internal.”

Indeed it is. A 1978 Gallup poll reported that ten million Americans were engaged in some aspect of Eastern religion and nine million in spiritual healing. Probably the main aspect that most were engaged in was some form of meditation — even as I was. With me, it was an idea l'd gleaned from _The URANTIA Book_, not any Eastern discipline.

“The great challenge to modern man is to achieve better communication with the divine Monitor that dwells within the human mind. Man's greatest adventure in the flesh consists in the well-balanced and sane effort to advance the borders of self-consciousness out through the dim realms of embryonic soul-consciousness in a wholehearted effort to reach the borderland of spirit-consciousness — contact with the divine presence. Such an experience constitutes God-consciousness...” (2097.2)
And this: “Unselfish social consciousness must be, at bottom, a religious consciousness; that is, if it is objective; otherwise it is a purely subjective philosophic abstraction and therefore devoid of love. Only a Godknowing individual can love another person as he loves himself.” (196.5)

1 hope I'm making sense to you. I think we have begun to renew and revitalize society in a really different way and that my path has been the path many others have taken — through a time of personality integration, into meditation. Laboratory investigation shows that these methods actually integrate the brain's activity, making it less random, provoking it into higher organization. Brains undergo a quite literal transformation. The proven plasticity of the human brain and human awareness offers the possibility that individual evolution may lead to collective evolution. When one person has unlocked a new capacity its existence is suddenly evident to others, who may then develop the same capacity.

## The Effect Of Critical Mass

Biologist Lyall Watson tells of the monkeys on islands south of Japan who were fed and kept under observation after World War II. Sweet potatoes were dropped from helicopters and though they were gritty and dirty, the monkeys ate them as they were until one monkey, one day, took his potato to the beach and washed it. Soon after, another monkey did the same, then another and another. Finally all were doing it. Then, suddenly, as the last monkey on the island instituted the practice, it sprang up among monkeys on a neighboring island. This is the thing we call critical mass, having its effect in a way that we don't understand, but which is almost impossible to stop.

There is a ripening out there in the world. C.S. Lewis described what seemed to him a secret society of new men and women “dotted here and there all over the earth.” I'm in this secret society and I'm sure you are, too. Five minutes of talk is enough to let you know whether you're with a member or non-member. But what I \mathrm{am} aware of is that it is no longer a closed socicty. Body-mind discoveries; the work being done in fields of acupuncture; biofeedback, hypnosis, and paranormal research have challenged Western models of how things work. Quantum physics, of all things, is proving to us that the universe is a living organism rather than a machine.

As Watson says, "Few aspects of human behavior are so persistent as our need to believe in things unseen and as a biologist. I find it hard to accept that this is purely fortuitous. The belief, or the strange things to
which this belief is so stubbornly attached, must have real survival value, and I think that we are rapidly approaching a situation in which the value will become apparent. As man uses up the resources of the world, he is going to have to rely more and more on his own. Many of these are at the moment concealed in the occult — a word that simply means 'secret knowledge' and is a very good description of something we have known all along but have been hiding from ourselves ... of all the faculties we possess, none is more important at this time than a wide-eyed sense of wonder."

This sense of wonder fills me as I tead the Tribune articles on brain research; as I hear how a six-year-old hemopheliac can be taught self-hypnosis in order to direct blood flow away from a site of injury in order to prevent injury to his joints; and I read about biofeedback and see people beginning to take responsibility for themselves as they realize the power of self-control and self-regulation that is within them. I am excited by the use of imagery techniques in treating disease. People are beginning to realize that they are not powerless, but they are also realizing that their power is somehow tied up with goodness and proper use.

The URANTLA Book says, “Within the bounds of that which is consistent with the divine nature, it is literally true that with God all things are possible.' The long-drawn-out evolutionary processes of peoples. planets, and universes are under the perfect control of the universe creators and administrators and unfold in accordance with the eternal purpose of the Universal Father, proceeding in harmony and order and in keeping with the all-wise plan of God. There is only one lawgiver,” (46.6) Well, I think God wants me to try very hard to understand quantum physics and to figure out just as much as I can about his laws and how things work and to try to stay in tune with the Divine Nature so that I don't run amok.

It's what we want for our children. We want them to exercise their divine curiosity, to keep fresh their sense of wonder, and to develop their precious and wonderful brains in a way we never have with our brains. A lovely Hebrew proverb says: “Do not confine your children to your own learning, for they were born in another time,” We want to teach our children in such a way that we increase their capacity for self-transcendance and evolutionary leaps. But to reach the children, you must first reach their parents and teachers so that crippling techniques of child-rearing are not practiced and the teachings of Jesus are. _The URANTIA Book_ says: “In this work of passing on the cultural torch to the next generation, the home will ever be the basic institution. The play and social life comes next, with the school last but equally indispensable in a complex and highly organized society.” (909.5)

Books such as those on transactional analysis and parent effectiveness training are helptul, Both books are based on the assumption that most maladaptive, antisocial behavior stems from faulty training and that the only practical solution is to greatly increase the psychological understanding of the citizenry, particularly parents and teachers. I think Jesus was an Adlerian.

The big new word in science is “paradigm,” which just means “the way things work” — and a new scientific paradigm is emerging which tells us what we already knew; that there is an inter-relatedness between all things. We are not separate; we are brothers. There is even a cosmic organizing force of some kind which you can call Mind, or Consciousness, or even God, if the Spirit moves you.

And today the Theosophical Library has two copies of _The URANTIA Book_ and a waiting list a mile long to get it out. Not only do all of m y best friends know about it; some have even read it. And many acquaintances have seen it and heard about it.

I must stop. I think that after all this time l've only said two things about renewing and revitalizing society. First, that as an individual, you must never stop trying to enlarge your capacity for love and loving service by any and all means that are possible to you, and second. that it is of prime importance to keep in touch with what is going on in the world so that we will know when our time comes, so that we can sense the increasing readiness that exists, even now, for the fact and teachings of _The URANTIA Book_.

## Angelsa Modern Theologic View

A Christian, no matter how modern in viewpoint, should be open to the fact that God's creation extends beyond his comprehension or experience, Because of this, and because angels have been part of scripture and teaching throughout the years, a Christian is open to the possibility that angels exist and that they serve a special function in creation.

## Journal Of Uranta * Brotherhood

For the most part, Christians under modern influence tend to view angels as Protestants do praying to the saints. That is, they “eliminate the middle man.” Most people experience God interceding directly into their lives rather than through some celestial being.

Many people who believe in the world of spiritualism and parapsychology believe that those who have died can continue to hover around people they love, and can be experienced and known by some gifted few. These “survivors” are rarely thought of as angels. Some of them are still very earthy and worldly and many are from pagan cultures. They aren't experienced as “angels” even by the gifted people to whom they appear.

The basic meaning of angel is a messenger of God. Most modern Christians experience God speaking to them in their own thoughts and feelings, in nature, and especially through other people. Many people who have no experience at all of celestial beings have met an angel of God when a good friend has courageously said, “I'm really worried about your drinking” or a young child says, “Sometimes I don't think you love me,”

A Christian's goal in life is to become what God means him to be. Any person or experience that helps us on our way can be an “angel” of God.

## The Seraphim

1 have elected myself and have been given a share of participation in our Universal Plan; spiritually I know that my guardian angel beckons me in a manner that is. delightful, but persuasive.

A body of 144 seraphim serves on an evolutionary sphere of creature habitation: “These angels preside over all seraphic assemblies pertaining to the line of duty or call to worship.” (429.3)

The spirit of brotherhood survives on Urantia because of the seraphims' work of achieving racial har- mony and social cooperation among our diverse races. “Without the work of these seraphim the efforts of the Material Sons to harmonize and advance the races of an evolving world would be greatly delayed. And had your Adam adhered to the original plan for the advancement of Urantia, by this time these spirits of brotherhood would have worked unbelievable transformations in the human race. In view of the Adamic default, it is indeed remarkable that these seraphic orders have been able to foster ... even as much of brotherhood as you now have on Urantia,” (437.3)

Some seraphim are designated as souls of peace. “Peace is not the natural state of the material realms, The worlds first realize 'peace on earth and good will among men through the ministry of the seraphic souls of peace.” “Although these angels were... thwarted in their early efforts on Urantia, Vevona, chief of the souls of peace in Adam's day, was left on Urantia and is now attached to the staff of the resident governor general. And it was this same Vevona who, when Michael was born, heralded to the worlds, as the leader of the angelic host, 'Glory to God in Havona and on earth peace and good will among men.” " (437.4)

In advanced epochs of planetary evolution these seraphim supplant “... the atonement idea by the concept of divine attunement as a philosophy of mortal survival.”〈*437:5〉

“Suspicion is the inherent reaction of primitive men; the survival struggles of the early ages do not naturally breed trust. Trust is a new human acquisition brought about by the ministry of these planetary seraphim of the Adamic regime, It is their mission to inculcate trust into the minds of evolving men. The Gods are very trustful; the Universal Father is willing freely to trust himself the Adjuster — to man's association.” (437.6)

— Victoria Uibar Santa Rosa, Californía

“Seraphim function as teachers of men by guiding the footsteps of the human personality into paths of new and progressive experiences. To accept the guidance of a seraphim rarely means attaining a life of ease. In following this leading you are sure to encounter, and if you have the courage, to traverse, the rugged hills of moral choosing and spiritual progress.” (1245.4 )
