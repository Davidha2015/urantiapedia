## A Message To The First Triennial Delegate Assembly

GREETINGS TO YOU — the delegates, alternates, councilors, and all Urantians — who are privileged to attend this first meeting of the Triennial Delegate Assembly. This is an historical occasion. What we do and say here will long be a matter of record in the archives of URANTIA Brotherhood, and I doubt not that future generations will look back with longing to this year 1964 and wish they could have been with us, just as we sometimes look back to the times of Jesus on earth and wish we could have walked with him through Galilee, could have sat under the trees with him, listening first-hand to his supernal teachings. Our coming together here today will be an experience we will long cherish, and I hope we will meet the challenges which it presents with courage, devotion, and above all, with unity of purpose.

It has been an honor to have had the privilege of serving as President of URANTIA Brotherhood for the past one and one-half years. And I wish to extend my sincere thanks to the other officers and administrators who have served with me during this period. I must here make special mention of the splendid work performed by the Program Committee for this Assembly — Alvin Kulteke, Marian Rowley, and Edith Cook — as well as the services of our fine secretary, Mrs. Anna Rawson. They have given unstintingly of their time in the preparation of the many details incident to this Assembly.

1 am thrilled by the opportunity to preside on this auspicious occasion. The Delegates and Alternates pre- sent in this room today are also thrilled, I am sure, to have been selected to represent their various Societies at the first meeting of the Assembly. Upon you rests a solemn responsibility.

It is our burden to bring life on this planet up to a new level, which we can and will do when we sincerely become imbued with the idea that we are ambassadors of a heavenly kingdom just as surely as were the twelve apostles who followed Jesus. Those twelve men were so inspired by Jesus' life and teachings that they went forth and turned the whole world upside down. I pray we will do likewise.

During my short tenure as President of URANTIA Brotherhood I have expounded on two theses: first, that we become living prophets of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man, and second, that we remember to subordinate _The URANTIA Book_ to the service of God.

Perhaps we should take a moment now to listen once again to Jesus' admonition to his apostles during one of his profound discussions on religion: “1 admonish you to give up the practice of always quoting the prophets of old .... and instead aspire to become living prophets ... and spiritual heroes of the coming kingdom.” (1731.6)

What is a prophet? Webster says a prophet is:

1. The proclaimer of a revelation
2. One who speaks for another, especially for God
3. An inspired revealer, interpreter, or spokesman
4. One whose office it is to deliver a message

What a message we have to deliver! We have in our hands a veritable El Dorado of riches. Only a handful of men and women on Urantia are so fortunate, so privileged, as we are.

I am not too much interested in the number of URANTIA Books you dispense, but I am tremendously interested in the souls you will lead into the kingdom by your own proclamation of the dynamic truths about God and his universe which Jesus has revealed to you; in how you are feeding the hungry souls that you meet “as you pass by.”

To emphasize my point I want to paraphrase a statement made by our first President in his report to the Brotherhood at the end of his three-year tenure. We must be careful not to confuse primary and secondary
loyalties. Our primary spiritual loyalty is to the Universal Father, and to him alone. When we encounter some spiritually hungry brother our first objective is to bring him closer to his heavenly Father. This we may attempt to do with or without the book. All things are secondary and subordinate to the acquisition of this one prize: the realization of sonship with God. The book itself is not an end; it is a most important means to an end. If _The URANTIA Book_ becomes mandatory in our ministry. then we have truly subordinated to it our first and primary objective and purpose, as Urantians, which is: the service of God.

“You cannot reveal God to those who do not seek for him ... Man must become hungry for truth as a result of the experiences of living, or he must desire to know God as the result of contact with the lives of those who are acquainted with the divine Father before another human being can act as the means of leading such a fellow mortal to the Father in heaven. If we know God, our real business on earth is so to live as to permit the Father to reveal himself in our lives, and thus will all Godseeking persons see the Father and ask for our help in finding out more about the God who in this manner finds expresson in our lives.” (1466.3)

When someone asks us, as the apostles asked Jesus, what is your religion? What do you believe? We will joyfully respond:

I believe that God is my Father.

I believe that I am his son.

I believe that all men are my brothers and that I am to serve them.

1 believe that this world is but a vestibule, a shakedown cruise, a testing, for my eternal adventure.

1 believe in the progressive advancement of my soul within the divine kingdom.

I believe that Jesus came to show us the way to the Father, for he said: “ I am the way, the truth, and the life.”

1 believe that I am an ambassador in my Father's kingdom.

I believe that some day I will attain Paradise and stand face to face with my Father in heaven.

I believe that my eternal life will take me into worlds not yet born where I shall have the sublime privilege of teaching about the Father the truths which his beloved Son has revealed to me during his lifetime on this world.

I believe that I must so live my life that all men will be attracted to me and be inspired to ask me concerning the Father. Jesus said: “It is not so much by the words you speak as by the lives you live, that men will know that you have been with me.”

I believe that the Spirit within me will show me the way, for my religion assures me that “at every crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always say: This is the way,'”

My dear friends, please bear in mind that good humor and the smile of happiness are among the most powerful and influential of the human assets of religious propagation.

Let us, therefore, be happy and valiant soldiers of the circles.

Aagust 20. 1964

## A Message To The Triennial Delegate Assembly

It is my pleasure to greet the delegates, alternates, councilors, and all the good Urantia friends who are privileged to attend the second Triennial Delegate Assembly. Three years ago, on August 20, 1964, we held the first meeting of the Assembly. That was an historical occasion. This is none the less auspicious and I hope that we have grown in grace and wisdom these past three years.

We know we are amateurs and we all feel very inadequate for the task of propagandizing the revelation of God and his universe which has been given to us in _The URANTIA Book_. No doubt the apostles of Jesus felt inadequate to go forth into the world preaching the kingdom of God as Jesus had bidden them to do. But they went out and turned the whole world upside down. Two thousand years later we are still quoting them. Like the apostles, we have been called to a great work. We have been called to offer a new light to a distracted world. We are the salt of the URANTIA revelation, the first light to illuminate the path of deliverance from the chaos, confusion, and darkness of the present planetary dilemma.

Few of us realize the grand and solemn significance of the times in which we are living. Far-reaching and lasting changes are taking place in human society. National, racial, social, economic, and spiritual upheavals are global in extent. The angels of progress marshall their reserves for the impending attack upon the world stalemate of international confusion and spiritual lethargy.

## Supreme Spiritual Purpose

Never lose sight of the fact that the supreme spiritual purpose of the Michael bestowal on Urantia was to enhance the revelation of God. But to us, of greater import, is that he also came here to reveal man to God. Through the scriptures we have been taught that he came here to reveal God to man, but not until _The URANTIA Book_ was given to us was I consciously aware that he came also to reveal man to God. Since Jesus is truly human as well as truly divine, it seems to me it is tremendously important and very comforting to know that he is in a way a revelation of man as well as a revelation of God.

You will recall that Immanuel, in imparting his bestowal counsel to Michael, said: “Equally with this ministry of new revelation and augmented interpretation of the Paradise Father to the human and superhuman type of mind, you will also so function as to make a new revelation of man to God. Exhibit in your one short life in the flesh, as it has never before been seen in all Nebadon, the transcendent possibilities attainable by a Godknowing human during the short career of mortal existence,” (1328.5)

We see in Jesus what man was meant to be. We see the divine possibilities of the human nature we bear. What we see today in our fellowmen makes us very solemn, but some wise man once said: “Man is rising, slowly with many setbacks. He is an unfinished product, slow- ly growing in stature, for he is born for eternity.”

Jesus knew the dark depths that there are in men. But it is just as certain that he knew the divine heights to which man can rise. He saw the glory that is man, as well as the low, sad aspects of human nature when it is spoiled. To the very end, he kept his hope and his faith that God and man belonged together.

“In his matchless life he never failed to reveal God to man. Now, in these final episodes of his mortal career and in his subsequent death, he made a new and touching revelation of man to God.” (2000.4)

While the Father in heaven loves us no more because of this bestowal of Michacl, all other celestial intelligences do. And this is because Jesus not only made a revelation of God to man, but he also likewise made a new revelation of man to the Gods and to the celestial inteligences of the universe of universes." (2003.1)

The amazing fact of Jesus' gospel, as I see it, is that truth, and light, and love, and the reality of God can break through the life of a person who was genuinely and truly a human person. Both God and man were here in him. Love of the most divine order was revealed in him, and in him the kingdom of God came into reality on earth as it is in heaven. Seeing him we see what God is like. The thing we primarily need is an enlarged capacity to appreciate the range and quality of Jesus' personality. We need to really see him. Labored explanations of the miraculous element in the story of his life have bulked so large that they have often obscured the real life. We have largely missed, I think, the glory and wonder of his life among us and have been too absorbed in the stories about him and about his work to feel the thrill and the power of his revelation.

The essential aspect of a God who would be adequate for our human needs could be revealed only through a person. The mathematical order can be revealed through atoms. Beauty can be revealed through rainbows and sunsets. But we want to feel the warmth and tenderness of a divine heart. We want someone who is with us in our agonies and our losses, in our struggles and frustrations, in our aspirations and our hopes. We want a Father-God who cares and who loves with a love that never lets go. Such a God Jesus has revealed.

Jesus went about this world kindling faith, calming life, eliminating fear, quieting fevers, both in minds and bodies, bringing peace and order into disordered lives, heavy-laden souls, and troubled hearts. He possessed the master secret of serenity. How we need this calming hand in the midst of our rush and hurry, our problems, and our worries!

“Be not conformed,” Paul said, which means do not get set, do not go static, do not settle down to fixed habitual forms. Have an istinct for what is vital, Be continually transformed by a constant fresh renewing of your mind. To me, religion is a series of new opportunities. “Not as though I had attained, or were already perfect, but I follow after,” cried Paul as he pressed towards still another open door of faith and service. We can accept the future with bright hope, if we will accept the primal faith that life has a genuine and gracious meaning, and the world has at its heart a purpose of good.

We can believe that there is a sphere for us, and a discipline, and a place in the Father's universal purpose. Ours is a call for a religion abreast of the enlarging discoveries of truth, adapted to the growing mind of man, and the expanding life of the world; that is the religion, the revelation, which _The URANTIA Book_ brings to us.

I have heretofore reminded you that the celestial supervisors of Urantia are mobilizing small groups of spirit-led men and women throughout the world-among all nations — and these truth battalions, these selectmen, are concerned today with scores of vital enterprises which have to do with the rehabilitation of the world following the ending of the present distressing conflicts.

And of all the emergency corps of mortal selectmen on Urantia, none is charged with a more solemn obligation than our group. We have been called to the great work of taking the first step in offering to mortal man a new light, a new revelation, of the love of God. The easy jog-trot religion of former days no longer suffices to meet the challenges of today. Following Jesus' way of life calls for an act of complete commitment, a dedicated intention, a resolute purpose, a trumpet call to a life that will not compromise.

God has provided the vision and the call. The answer must be ours. There are steps we can take that will help us to meet this challenge:

First, we need to cultivate the power to envision our share in bettering the world.

Second, we need to believe that God can speak to us, that he can use us and our talents, and that he does call us to our particular place of service.

Third, we need to be willing to be used for the fulfillment of the vision.

Let us pray that we may all become valiant soldiers of the circles, wholeheartedly enlisted in the solid ranks of those mortals who shall go forth in the coming battle for truth against error under the unfaltering leadership of the mighty seraphim of progress.

## A Message To The Summer Study Session On Loyalty And Service

We Urantians, as we traverse life day by day, may often have been concerned with our progress in bringing the Kingdom of God into our hearts and into the hearts of our fellow man. We may have been concerned with whether we are promoting the living gospel of the Fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man wisely, and well. But if we do question our service, then we must, in fact, be questioning the roots of that service which are loyalty and love. We must learn to make neeessary daily adjustment between our personal convictions and our duty toward family and associates. We must achieve the satisfaction of effecting an increasingly harmonious blending of personal convictions and family obligations into a masterful concept of group solidarity based upon loyalty, fairness, tolerance, and love as Jesus did so magnificently.

“What is loyalty? It is the fruit of an intelligent appreciation of universe brotherhood; one could not take so much and give nothing. As you ascend the personality scale, first you learn to be loyal, then to love, then to be filial, and then may you be free; but not until you are a finaliter, not until you have attained perfection of loyalty, can you self-realize finality of liberty.” (435.5) And this perfection of loyalty is the first manner in which we attain perfection, indeed the only way we have gained perfection at the time we are mustered into the Corps of Finality.

_The URANTIA Book_ tells us how loyalty evolves in our world: “As religion evolves, ethics becomes the philosophy of morals, and morality becomes the discipline of self by the standards of highest meanings and supreme values — divine and spiritual ideals. And thus religion becomes a spontaneous and exquisite devotion, the living experience of the loyalty of love.” (1012.7) We further know that the fruit of love is service.

The test of loyalty is truly one of the supreme tests of our mortal existence. The importance and value of loyalty is a recurrent theme in the URANTIA teachings, particularly loyalty in the face of tribulation. Throughout the universe, broadcasts go forth pronouncing the news of manifestations of loyalty in the face of hardship. Our own planet was the site of one of the most amazing exhibitions of loyalty by Van and Amadon. "Caligastia, with a maximum of intelligence and a vast experience in universe affairs, went astray — embraced \sin. Amadon, with a minimum of intelligence and utterly devoid of universe experience, remained steadfast in
the service of the universe and in loyalty to his associate. Van utilized both mind and spirit in a magnificent and effective combination of intellectual determination and spiritual insight, thereby achieving an experiential level of personality realization of the highest attainable order." (757.3)

One of the distinguishing factors about the mortal ascension scheme seems to be the loyalty shown by mortals who have experienced survival. Again in conjunction with Lucifer rebellion, we read that “not a single Jerusem citizen was lost,” a group numbering over 187 million. Vast numbers of other personalities were lost. (p. 608-609)

Loyalty is well rewarded, “All through the Paradise career, reward follows effort as the result of causes. Such rewards set off the individual from the average, provide a differential of creature experience, and contribute to the versatility of ultimate performances in the collective body of the finaliters.” (579.2)

Loyalty implies many things. First, the relationship between loyalty, love, and service is a very close interassociation. It cannot be stressed too much that first we learn to be loyal, then to love, and genuine love brings with it a concomitant desire to serve. Loyalty also implies growth, dynamic life, progress. And, finally, loyalty implies patience, the patience of a tadpole becoming a frog. In the biologic world, we do not observe growth in a single day; growth is slow, unconscious. Nature has that perennial lesson to teach us.

We must endeavor to retain a sound awareness and keen understanding and perspective on the relationships of these virtues, We are admonished that “If you would share the Master's joy, you must share his love. And to share his love means that you have shared his service. Such an experience of love does not deliver you from the difficulties of this world; it does not create a new world, but it most certainly does make the old world new.” (1945.3)

One thing we must remember is that today we are still tadpoles — and that the URANTIA movement is a tadpole. Let us accept this fact and live loyally today as tadpoles. Tomorrow is going to attend to itself. We can and will bring “the greatest truths mortal man can ever hear” into the hearts of men. And we need not be too anxious about it. We can be sure of serving well and wisely so long as we preserve a supreme loyalty and devotion to our heavenly Father, ever learning more how to become like him. We will serve and serve in the true spirit which motivates service. We are very lucky today! We all have many friends with a common purpose. _The URANTIA Book_ tells us, “The presence of a friend enhances all beauty and exalts every goodness. By intelli- gent symbols man is able to quicken and enlarge the appreciative capacities of his friends. One of the crowning glories of human friendship is this power and possibility of the mutual stimulation of the imagination. Great spiritual power is inherent in the consciousness of wholehearted devotion to a common cause, mutual loyalty to a cosmic Deity.” (1776.3)

“... human loyalties, once mobilized, are hard to change." (148B:7) So we must be certain, not only that we have loyalty, but that we have the right kind of loyalty, and intelligent, far-reaching, and supreme loyalty. And we must be aware that the cost of loyalty can be high. And then we must determine if we are ready to proclaim our loyalty. I would like to read the words of the Master as he talked to his apostles concerning this: “Pointing out each of the twenty-four and calling them by name, Jesus said: 'And now, which one of you would prefer to take this easy path of conformity to an established and fossilized religion, as defended by the Pharisees at Jerusalem, rather than to suffer the difficulties and persecutions attendant upon the mission of proclaiming a better way of salvation to men while you realize the satisfaction of discovering for yourselves the beauties of the realities of a living and personal experience in the eternal truths and supreme grandeurs of the kingdom of heaven? Are you fearful, soft, and easeseeking? Are you afraid to trust your future in the hands of the God of truth, whose sons you are? Are you distrustful of the Father, whose children you are? Will you go back to the easy path of the certainty and intellectual settledness of the religion of traditional authority, or will you gird yourselves to go forward with me into that uncertain and troublous future of proclaiming the new truths of the religion of the spirit, the kingdom of heaven in the hearts of men?' ”(1730.2) Then Jesus closed this emotional appeal by saying, “Go now apart by yourselves, each man alone with the Father, and there find the unemotional answer to my question, and having found such a true and sincere attitude of soul, speak that answer freely and boldly to my Father and your Father, whose infinite life of love is the very spirit of the religion we proclaiml” (1730.3)

And now, let us who are here today ask Jesus' question of ourselves, and when the opportunity is upon us, let us go apart by oursclves, each man alone with the Father, and there find the unemotional answer to Jesus' question, and having found such a true and sincere attitude of soul, speak that answer freely and boldy to our Father, whose infinite life of love is the very spirit of the religion we proclaim.

## Message To The <Br> General Conference Of Urantia Brotherhood

Greetings to the Soldiers of the Circles! This designation has been applied to us because we are the men and women who have been called to take the first steps in offering a new light to a frustrated church and a distracted world. We are the first light in nearly 2,000 years to illuminate the path of deliverance from the chaos, confusion, and darkness of the present planetary dilemma.

But we are not soldiers bearing arms. We bear the good news of man's sonship with God — our Heavenly Father. W are entrusted with a great and unique responsibility — the custody, safeguarding, and dissemination of _The URANTIA Book_. The carrying out of this responsibility will require of all those who would take it up: self-discipline, dedication, and extraordinary efforts at co-operation. So may we all be valiant Soldiers of the Circles, wholeheartedly enlisted in the ranks of those mortals who shall go forward in the battle for truth against error under the unfaltering leadership of the mighty seraphic corps,

“... (Our) mission among men is to proclaim the gospel of the kingdom — the reality of the fatherhood of God and the truth of the sonship of man. (We are to) proclaim the whole truth of the good news, not just a part of the saving gospel ... Sonship with God, by faith, is still the saving truth of the gospel of the kingdom. (We) are to go forth preaching the love of God and the service of man. That which the world needs most to know is: Men are the sons of God, and through faith they can actually realize, and daily experience, this ennobling truth. (Michael's) ... bestowal should help all men to know that they are the children of God, but such knowledge will not suffice if (we) fail personally to faith-grasp the saving truth that (we) are the living spirit sons of the eternal Father. The gospel of the kingdom is concerned with the love of the Father and the service of his children on earth.” (2052.4-2053:1)

Let all mankind benefit from the overflow of our loving spiritual ministry, enlightening intellectual communion, and uplifting social service; but none of these humanitarian labors, nor all of them, should be permitted to take the place of proclaiming the gospel. These mighty ministrations are the social by-products of the still more mighty and sublime ministrations and transformations wrought in the heart of the kingdom believer by the Spirit of Truth and by the personal realization that the faith of a spirit-born soul confers the assurance of living fellowship with the eternal God.
Let me remind you that we are in the greatest business on this planet. I call it “this business of finding God.” In “this business of finding God,” we have been called torch-bearers. Let the torch shine brightly for we have much work to do. For this is our world and what happens in it is ours for the making.

## Beyond Global Significance

We are afforded the opportunity of playing a significant part in helping Urantia take its place among the enlightened worlds of Satania. We are in the vanguard of the movement which shall gradually make each of us one with the enlightened cosmic citizenry of our local universe. The events of our unusual little planet constitute it of unique value to this universe. Our mission is, therefore, far more than global in its significance.

We are in the busines of making this a better world. Why not strive to make this the best world in all Satania? Jesus lived here. What a pleasure it would be for him to know that this is the goal we have chosen for ourselves.

Picture just a moment the whole panorama of the planetary stage whereon we are now to play our part. To begin with, our planet is an experimental one, certain experiments having succeeded, others having failed. It had been assumed that certain of these failures would be offset by the normal epochal revelations of a planet. However, the Caligastia upheaval and the Adamic default further complicated and compounded what were already unusual problems. Ours is a long history of planetary savagery and retardation. The accumulated mortal propensities were even sufficient to thwart, dilute, and submerge beneath the evolutionary wave the teaching: of a Melchizedek Emergency Son and the Sovereign Creator of our universe. In this spiritually confused environment, “... the aims of the best overshadowed by the drift of the worst ....” "a fortuitous set of circumstances made possible the launching of the fifth epochal revelation. (1224.1)

This has been our past. What is the future? It lies in our hands. _The URANTIA Book_, containing a restatement of the life and teachings of the greatest revelation of God to man possible, can eventually direct civilization from its present low status to the very threshold of the unimaginable ages of light and life.

Wisely and well

This is why we are called Soldiers of the Circles. We are called to do this. We are called to begin this work. It
will take generations upon generations to complete this work, but we must start it. Time must necessarily intervene between the planting of a seed, its growth to maturity, and the harvesting of its fruits. Therefore, let us not be impatient, but let us plan our work wisely and well. Let us adopt a perspective of thousands of years not just our short lifetime. I do not believe that there is a group in this world charged with a more solemn responsibility than ours. We who have dedicated our lives to the service of the URANTIA revelation can little realize the import of our doing. We are just beginning the great work and we, who are the seed-sowers of today, may live and die without fully realizing the potentials of our participation in this dawning of a new age of religion on our planet. We are pioneers in a new planetary adventure. We have a solemn obligation.

Love is the great, infectious power by which the transformation will take place. The love of God and the love of man are the simple truths which will guide the new religious era, the great motivators which will enable us to do our task. The consciousness of sonship with God quickens the entire life service of every man, woman, and child who becomes the possessor of such a mighty stimulus to all the inherent powers of a human personality. Love is infectious, and when human devotion is intelligent and wise, love is more catching than hate. But only genuine and unselfish love is truly contagious. If each mortal could only become a focus of dynamic affection, this benign virus of love would soon pervade the sentimental emotion-stream of humanity to such an extent that all civilization would be encompas5ed by love, and that would be the realization of the brotherhood of man. The simple truths of the love of God and the love of man can unify the religions of the world and bring together in appreciative harmony the religionists of the world filled as it is with diversity in culture, language, background, and experience.

One important lesson we must learn is trustworthiness, confidential capacity. Jesus often admonished his apostles, “See that you tell no man.” Our great responsibility consists in becoming so saturated with the truths of this revelation that all persons coming in contact with us will feel that we are truth lovers and spiritual explorers, that we are cosmic citizens engaged in the fascinating adventure of searching for God and dedicated to the supreme passion of doing his divine will.

In the battle of truth against error, we have simple but effective means to begin to nullify the consequences of the Caligastia rebellion and the Adamic default. It was the plan that Adam and Eve would establish many outposts of light throughout the planet and it has occurred to me that perhaps our societies and URANTIA Book study groups will, in some measure, compensate for the miscarriage of the Adamic plan by becoming such outposts of light and truth.

This is the kind of thing that is now possible on our world. We must stop thinking of ourselves as a backward and wayward planet which has lost its way, and begin to see ourselves in the light of the new truth we have as the mortal home of our sovereign Son, Michael of Nebadon.

Our task is a tremendous one and cannot be accomplished in one generation, but we must prepare the soil, sow the sceds for the future harvest. We regard _The URANTIA Book_ as a feature of the progressive evolution of human society. The book belongs to the era immediately to follow the present ideological struggle.

Each of us has a part to play in the immediate re-organization of human society. And it is work — hard work. But it is also an adventure. And the rewards of adventure are manifold and the taste of real adventure is grand and glorious. The possibilities for service are diverse and challenging. There is an endless supply of areas of endeavor which can readily employ the efforts of the spirit-led sons and daughters of God.

Challenges both large and small are waiting to be accepted. On a global scale they include, to name just a few:

1. Fire — its prevention and the relief of its victims
2. Floods — their control and the care of sufferers
3. Earthquakes — study of their prevention and the study and building of new earthquake resistive structures and, of course, the relief of sufferers
4. Plaque — prevention and world-wide care and treatment
5. Famine — feeding the hungry
6. Population Control — the achicvement and maintenance of the optimum land-man ratio and the necessity of improving humanity and the lessening of racial degeneracy

On a more personal but not less important scale are:

To love God and strive to do His will.

To love our fellowmen as Jesus loved them.

To be a good son or daughter in an earthly family.

To be a wise an loving mate and parent. To be a loyal friend.

To participate in local government as an individual.

To asist in the visitation and care of the elderly, the sick and the infirm, and

Even to work to keep our streets clean.

Of course, there are many more areas wherein we may each now participate. We needn't sit back asking why “they” don't do this and “they” don't do that. We can become involved personally now.

But let us lovingly caution one another that in so becoming involved, we forever keep before us the mission of our societies and study groups — spiritual upliftment. We must avoid giving up our ultimate spiritual mission as we individually become involved in the worthy and necessary activities of the realm.

Let us be about our Father's business. The hour is striking for each of us as individuals intelligently to contribute to the re-organization of the world in our respective spheres. We know what could be done. It is up to us to do it. Our planetary history is filled with great individuals of past eras, men and women who have acted rightly, courageously, and joyously in accordance with our Father's will. And these individuals, known and unknown to the pages of planetary history, are the leaders who have accounted for the mortal part of what progress has been made. Every person here today could similarly aspire to mobilize his or her personality potential to the service of our Father in heaven and to the satisfaction of his Creator Son in the many tasks we have at hand.

Ours is a transcendent privilege. I don't believe we fully realize that we are participants in the birth of a new age of religion on our planet. As a friend so often says, “Only transformed individuals can create a transformed world.” Remember, this is our world — our planet — and we are not just casual observers of an epochal drama. We are an important part of it. The eyes of the universe are upon us, each and every one of us, as we actively play our part in this new era. Let us ever be alert to the importance of the extraordinary responsibility — truth — which has been placed in our hands.

We have our marching orders. We must go to work in our respective spheres. Let us be patient. Let us be wise. Let us seek good counsel and proceed with group wisdom. And in doing so, may we have every ounce of the bold, courageous, joyous, righteous, and cbullient spirit that our own Creator Son of Nebadon displayed when he was here, Good humor and the smile of happiness are among the most powerful and influential of the human assets of religion propagation.

We may be few in number now. Some of us may even feel isolated in our respective spheres. “ ... (But) those who would see wonderful things must often be ready to travel alone,” And “while he who walks in love may wander far,” in truth, we always know the real end of our quest.

In the words of Jesus, “You see for yourselves that the harvest is plenteous, but the laborers are few. Let us all, therefore, pray the Lord of the harvest that he send forth still more laborers into his fields.” (1681.8)

“Having started out on the way of life everlasting, having accepted the assignment and received your orders to advance, do not fear the dangers of human forgetfulness and mortal inconstancy, do not be troubled with doubts of failure or by perplexing confusion, do not falter and question your status and standing, for in every dark hour, at every crossroad in the forward struggle, the Spirit of Truth will always speak, saying, This is the way.' ” (*(383.2)

“If you will only love one another as I am loving you, you shall be my friends, and I will ever speak to you of that which the Father reveals to me.” (1945.1) Jesus to the apostles in the Farewell Discourse
