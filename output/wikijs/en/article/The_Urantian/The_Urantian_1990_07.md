## Welcome Address at Fifth Epochal Fellowship's 1990 Urantia Conference 

Aspen, Colorado — June 30, 1990
by David Elders, President

Jo Ann Brummett made a comment yesterday at the social which struck me as particularly powerful and inspirational. She observed that each of the details you see around here from the signs and decorations down to each individual cookie that was homemade for the social, is an expression of love...that it is an expression from a person who wants to serve other people. I was moved deeply by that powerful statement!

This is, as John Hay said, the largest gathering of _Urantia Book_ readers that we have ever had come together for a conference. Think for just a moment about the number of Adjusters in this room...one thousand! Think of the number of angels and other beings that are here with us just outside the range of our vision. Think about the souls that are developing minute by minute. Think of the Supreme who is coming into existence by virtue of the work each of us is doing internally and externally. Think about what it means in particular to be conscious of these realities, to actually know what is going on, to be a conscious participant in that process. As we sit here we can literally sense these things, we can sense the meaning and value of the other people sitting around us.

## Walking with God

by Steve Dreier, Keynote Speaker

Each of us is involved in a dual relationship to God in the inner — life and in the outer-life. The walk with God in the inner-life concerns the personal relationship with God; the walk with God in the outer-life involves everything else.

Let us begin by considering the inner-life. The possibility of the inner walk with God is founded on the presence of two cosmic realities. One is the Thought Adjuster; the other is personality. The concept of the personal walk with God requires that both we and God are present together. Unless this condition is satisfied the concept of walking with God would be a beautiful poetic sentiment, but would have no basis in fact.

As we know, both of these realities are present with and within every normal human being. Each of us is a person; each of us has received the gift of personality from the Universal Father. Also, for the last two thousand years, every personality on this planet has received from the same Universal Father the gift of the divine Thought Adjuster — the literal and factual presence of God within us. It is on the presence of these two cosmic realities that everything else rests. Each of us is present, and God is present with each of us. The inner walk with God involves the evolution of the relationship between the two.

Thank you for your very kind attention. Have a wonderful week.

## Cooperation with the Supreme The Role of Conscious Choice in Value Development

by Dan Massey

About sixteen years ago I received and began seriously to study _The Urantia Book_. In the passing years, I have often spoken to groups of readers, both large and small, about my understanding of certain parts and teachings of the book. Since presenting a talk at Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, twelve years ago on “Science and _The Urantia Book_”, I have frequently been asked to review and extend my ideas in public. Although I have often expressed my feelings on the philosophical and cultural aspects of the relationship of science and religion, I have never directly addressed the exact role which scientific and rationalist thought plays in unifying my personal religious experience around the teachings of _The Urantia Book_.

There are several reasons for this omission. I know that sincere statements of personal religious faith by one person, when expressed to another, often seem superficial or unpersuasive. I anticipate that many of the things I will say to you this afternoon will seem quite strange. Although I find my viewpoint of these matters wholly persuasive, I accept that, because of differing viewpoints, experiences, and patterns of thought, not everyone will find my views convincing. In spite of these natural reservations about opening my personal spiritual attitudes and thoughts to public examination, I know that the time has come for me to express these ideas plainly and clearly to receptive persons.

## Reconciliation and Growth

by Mary Daly

Let's begin by asking the Holy Spirit to make us triumphant over the sophistry of presumption.

Lord, we ask you to reveal your presence in a deeper way here. We're to talk over some matters of spiritual growth; help us to put aside any other concerns and be open to you. If there's an experience of your touch that we need to understand better or a question that needs to be answered, give us a quiet and gentle spirit to hear your word in wisdom. I do truly praise you that you continue to call each one of us so faithfully.

I'd like to begin with a delightful story from a nun named Sister Briege McKenna. Briege entered the convent at age fifteen and was a first grade teacher with crippling arthritis in her early twenties. After seeing many doctors both in Ireland and in America, she expected to be in a wheelchair within months and all the doctors hoped for was to be able to control the pain. One day, in one split second, as she was seeking a deeper relationship with Jesus, she was completely healed. Some months later when Jesus was calling her to a deeper work of faith, she had this little vision of her life. In this image, Jesus came to visit her, and knocked on the door of her house. She opened and was delighted to welcome him in and invite him to make himself at home. So he did, and he went from room to room until he came to a room marked with a big sign:

## In Search of the Error So Great...

by Nancy Johnson

> _...Forms are valueless when lessons are learned. No chick may be had without the shell, and no shell is of any worth after the chick is hatched. <ins>But sometimes error is so great that its rectification by revelation would be fatal to those slowly emerging truths which are essential to its experiential overthrow.</ins>..._ ([UB 48:6.32](/en/The_Urantia_Book/48#p6_32))

No doubt we have all paid attention service to this provocative statement by an archangel from Nebadon, and surely this archangel intended to pique our curiosity and stimulate us to examine our conceptual environment — our belief system — to recognize an error that's so out of sync with true reality that they couldn't tell us what it was. What truth could have had such a traumatic impact on us at that time? Did they give us any clues?

Consider for a moment the nature of the following conceptual errors, presented in arbitrary order, which the revelators of truth did not hesitate to correct:

## The Art of Sharing

by Carol Hay

Today I want to talk to you about sharing your spiritual life with others. When I use the term “spiritual life,” what I am referring to is the inner relationship that you have with God. In my personal experience, one of the main ways that God relates to me is through the love that he gives me, So when I share my spiritual life with other people, I'm mainly passing the love that God gives me along to other people. _The Urantia Book_ tells us that love is the desire to do good to others, so spiritual sharing is a very action-oriented, creative approach to life that involves a desire to share the love that we receive from God with others. And — if you're like me — you've had some very wonderful experiences sharing your spiritual life with other people and you've also had some really awful experiences with it.

So we're going to talk about ways to share our spiritual lives so that we consistently get the results that we want when we share spiritually, so we can make a difference in the lives of those around us, and so we can make a difference in the relationship that we have with God as well. I'd like you to help me answer three questions in regard to spiritual sharing. The first question is: What is the purpose of sharing our spiritual life with others? The next question is: When do we share it; when is it appropriate? And last: What sort of skills do we need to more effectively share our spiritual life with others?

## Individual Ministry: Community Service

by John Lange

**Introduction**

As devotees of the Urantia revelation we have chosen to explore new spiritual realities. As we each pursue our own spiritual growth through religious experience, _The Urantia Book_ on [UB 100:1.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/100#p1_8) lists habits to discipline this process. The discipline I shall focus upon is “_the recognition of religious living in others._” What is religious living and how do we recognize it? On page 66 we are given a simple and inspiring answer: “_...it [religion] is a living and dynamic experience of divinity attainment predicated on humanity service._” Therefore the recognition of religious living is an appreciation of this service dynamic as manifested in others.

Through service we gain status as universe citizens, and this is emphasized in every section of _The Urantia Book_. In our universe career we are told on [UB 28:6.17](/en/The_Urantia_Book/28#p6_17), “_Service...is the goal of time and the destiny of space._” In the Thought Adjuster papers at the bottom of [UB 110:3.8](/en/The_Urantia_Book/110#p3_8) we are instructed that we can consciously augment Adjuster harmony by “_loving God and desiring to be like him_” and by “_loving man and sincerely desiring to serve him._”

## Walking with Children Walking with God

by Sara L. Blackstock

As director of a school-age day care center for the last four years, I have been blessed with a human laboratory. I work with about 180 children in grades kindergarten through fifth grade. One of the greatjoys of this job is the intense and real relationship which the staff and I have with the children. We live with almost 100 children daily. It is very close to a family feeling in many ways, and it is definitely a community.

Even though I am an accredited California teacher with about 25 years of teaching experience behind me, it was not until working here that I really began to experience the joys of working with children. I have come to explain the difference, to myself anyway, like this: as a teacher I had to impose a system on the children which had been orchestrated by a removed bureaucratic hierarchy. “Educating children,” in such a context, almost seems to mean taking them out of their real life, relative frameworks and putting information into them.

# True Worship: A Commentary on Paper 5, Section 3

by Jeffrey Wattles

Let us listen again to the Divine Counselor of Uversa, whose account of “True Worship” may be found in _The Urantia Book_ in section 3 of Paper 5, “Cod's Relation to the Individual.” Our commentary cannot properly be a monologue, but I have not marked, in the present text, the pauses for discussion that punctuated it. This discussion follows one on the prayer process ([Paper 91 \#9](/en/The_Urantia_Book/91#p9_1)) and anticipates one on service. The commentary here is a step toward holographic study — finding the whole of the book in the part.

Worship is both simple and complex. The simplicity of worship is reflected in the fun of the word for worship among the Quicatec Indians of Mexico; it means, etymologically, “to wag one's tail before God.” One of the wisest teachings I ever heard on worship was Vern Grimsley's remark, “The secret of worship is to do it.” One great message of _The Urantia Book_ is that WE CAN worship. We are in the Father's personality circuit. Our minds enjoy the adjutant mind-spirit of worship. We are built to worship. However complex or mysterious worship may seem when discussed, and however elusive it may be at times in our practice, we can and do worship the Universal Father. The section on True Worship articulates the concept of worship. When we read this highly articulated account, we may be led to remark, “Easier said than done.” But if we keep in tune with the worship experience itself, then we may say, “Easier done than said.” Let us take a moment to do just that before proceeding....

## Spiritual Sharing-A Pathway to God

by Melissa Wells

I'm Melissa Wells, and I'm from Tampa, Florida, where I work as a journalist. I am raising a 12-year-old son named Grayson and my 10-year-old daughter, Rebecca, who just might be lucky enough to make it to age eleven.

Besides being a long-time student of _The Urantia Book_, I have spent the past couple of years working the twelve steps from Alcoholics Anonymous.

At the time that I was offered the opportunity to speak at this meeting on the subject of the recognition of religious living in others, I had just recently committed to attending 90 meetings at AA in 90 days. Obviously, I wish to share with you the fact that I am an alcoholic. I do this without reservation, because it is only since realizing the stern nature of this disease and seeking help from my Higher Power in overcoming it that I have come to find a real measure of lasting peace within myself and harmony with my fellows.

The significance of attending 90 consecutive days of AA meetings is in the fact that it has given me the rich experience of sharing with others how God has provided spiritual solutions to life-threatening material difficulties. This has been an astounding quarter-year of my life. I have grown tremendously as a result of this spiritual experience. An increasing awareness of God at work in my own life has come during this investigation of the AA way of life.

## Fellowship with God, Now & Forever

by Gard Jameson & Florence Jameson, M.D.

In telling his followers the essence of his message to the planet, Jesus stated that the cardinal features of the gospel were:

1. The pre-eminence of the individual.
2. The will as the determining factor in man's experience,
3. Spiritual fellowship with God the Father.
4. The supreme satisfactions of the loving service of man.
5. The transcendency of the spiritual over the material in human personality.

The midwayer author goes on to say that “this world has never seriously or sincerely or honestly tried out these dynamic ideas and divine ideals....” (1863) Why not? Why do we resist fellowship with God? To a group of Greek believers in Jerusalem, Jesus said, “My Father sent me to the world to reveal his loving-kindness to the children of men, but those to whom I first came have refused to receive me...I have told them of sonship with joy, liberty, and life more abundant in the spirit...the leaders of my people deliberately blinded their eyes that they see not, and hardened their hearts...All these years have I sought to heal them of their unbelief that they might be recipients of the Father's eternal salvation.” (1902)

Jesus sought then and seeks now to heal our unbelief. He brings an amazing demonstration of divine love to the planet. And, for the most part, his revelation is rejected and resisted or superficially accepted. Once again two thousand years later an updated revelation is given to us. My question to each of you and to myself is, are we superficial recipients of this revelation? If we are earnest in our receipt of this revelation, to what degree? We are told that “the call to the adventure of building a new and transformed human society by means of the spiritual rebirth of Jesus' brotherhood of the kingdom should thrill all who believe in him as men have not been stirred since the days when they walked about on earth as his companions in the flesh.” (2084)

Jesus' parable of the sower is an objective observation of the human condition and its diversity. There are those on the planet who have hardened their hearts by either pride or fear, those who are superficial in their interest in the affairs of the kingdom, and those who in some degree exhibit real interest in a spiritual renaissance for this planet. Quoting the Prophet Jeremiah, Jesus told his followers that “the human heart is deceitful above all things...How easy for you to become self-deceived....” (1609) Spiritual arrogance and pride follow closely on the heals of any epochal revelation. Consider the numerous examples in the first four epochal revelations. Such arrogance and pride disable all our attempts at genuine relationship, real fellowship with God and our brothers and sisters.

Jesus is the ultimate psychotherapist. He not only sees and describes the painful state of human nature. He provides us with a very simple prescription which is designed to handle virtually all of our neurotic conditions, our dysfunctional relationships and behavior. His message reveals that each of us has been given, through the unique gift of personality, a “will” which is the determining factor in each of our journeys toward fellowship with God. The question that faces each of us is whether we will stand up, recognize the ways in which we have been deceiving ourselves and others, using our “will” to enter into fellowship with God and our brothers and sisters, or we will allow that “will” to lie dormant and neuroses to build, overwhelming us and all of our relationships.

Jesus calls us to use our personal, individual “will” to overcome our superficiality. If the thought that you might be superficial bothers you, that is good. Because if it bothers you, like it bothers me, then we both might be induced to exercise our “wills,” recognize our own self-deceit, adjust our attitudes and “enable” our “spiritual nature to begin” our “deliverance from the evils of inaction by the power-presence of living faith.” (1438, “The Young Man Who Was Afraid”) Once you acknowledge your own lethargy and superficial nature some real healing can begin to take place. If you do not acknowledge any lethargy or superficiality, and self-deceit within your soul, then either your heart has been hardened by fear or pride, or you're extremely close to fusion.

## Some Thoughts On Worship

“Worship is a personal communion with that which is divinely real, with that which is the very source of reality.” (2095)

Worship is our personal response to the Infinite Personality, It is our loving act of real appreciation for existence, for the opportunity of serving our Universal Father, the very source of that love which we share in our worship experience. It is a personal communication of love, signifying our adoration for the Eternal Creator. Worship is indeed the most profound response that we mortals are capable of to the Reality of our love experience.

Worship is an ever-present opportunity for the one who loves God. You “should rejoice in the recognition of the ever-present possibility of immediate communion with the bestowal spirit of the Father so intimately associated with your inner soul and your spiritualizing self.” (63)

Once we begin to fathom the nature of the personal communion possible with the Father, we recognize the importance of maintaining our communion. We are told that “the enlightened worlds all recognize and worship the Universal Father.” (21) Worship becomes then the
center of our religious experience, the very source of our inspiration to be of service in the Father's kingdom.

“Worship is the highest privilege and the first duty of all created intelligences.” ( +303) Worship is a privilege because it signifies the sublime and wonderful nature of our intimate relationship with the very source of reality. Worship is a duty because it is the basis of our relationship with the source of all reality, the Universal Father. Without worship, we lack that personal basis for knowing our true identity and eternal destiny, to become perfect even as our Father.

Worship is the greatest pleasure in all of existence. Worship is the most enjoyable experience experienceable! Worship takes us immediately, even now, into the presence of the Universal Father, the Source of Truth, Beauty and Goodness, Love Personified, and transforms our souls by its loving touch. Worship is our bridge to the Paradise Isle; it is the one experience which will ensure safe passage from our isolated planet on the backroads of infinity to the Home of Our Creator, Our God, Our Father.

Worship is transformative, “the act of a part identifying itself with the Whole; the finite striking step with eternity.” (1616) “Worship, taught Jesus, makes one increasingly like the being who is worshiped. Worship is a transformative experience whereby the finite gradually approaches and ultimately attains the presence of the Infinite.” (1641)

It is said of Jesus that “the secret of his unparalleled religious life was this consciousness of the presence of God; and he attained it by intelligent prayer and sincere worship-unbroken communion with God.” (2089) The secret of our religious lives will be our own sense of inner communion which we establish by our personal attention to prayer and sincere worship. Without this relationship to God, our lives would be very superficial indeed.

Worship is not a complicated technique. The greatest difficulty with worship is the commitment to want to know the Universal Father on an intimate basis. The degree of commitment ensures the success of the personal contact.

The experience of worship can arise in many, many ways. The following is only one suggested approach that may be of assistance to you.

1. Take a couple of minutes to quiet yourself down, follow your breathing for a moment or two, allowing yourself to be centered. “Commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still.” (Psalm 4)
2. Move in faith into the center of your being, the dwelling place of God. To move in faith to your center, you may use a centering “worship word,” such as “Father,” a single, simple word that expresses your faith-intent, begin to let your “worship word” repeat itself within your soul. “I will praise Thee, O Lord, with my whole heart.” (Psalm 8)
3. Whenever you find in the course of your worship that you are pulled away from the center of your soul by some distraction, gently return to the Presence by the use of your “worship word.” All sorts of thoughts may attempt to dominate your attention. Do not allow any of these thoughts to captivate your attention. “My eyes are ever toward the Lord for He will release my feet from the net.” (Psalm 25)
4. You may wish to move from worship to prayer, or from worship to worshipful problem solving. If this is your intention, then move gently into your prayer or worshipful problem solving, recognizing that prayer and worshipful problem solving are not real worship. In worship, our intention is the act of loving God purely, with no element of self-interest. Let your real worship be pure.

With respect to our approach to fellowship, Jesus' message is plain and simple: worship and service, service and worship. These two elements of approach bring each of us into fellowship with God directly. But, they need to go hand in hand. The revelators make it clear that we seriously neglect our worshipful approach to God. Do you make worship a part of your daily routine? If not, then your approach is off. I cannot underscore too much the importance of daily worship in your spiritual journey. I understand that our time constraints make it difficult to fit in; when this is the case, have we not clearly misaligned our priorities in a serious manner? Should not there always be time for a personal rendezvous with God the Father, Michael of Nebadon and the Creative Mother Spirit, and attending guardian angels on a daily basis?

If we do not make time for worship are we not like Martha in the kitchen “cumbered by many trivial cares”; the rich young man, Matadormus, enslaved by his “love of himself and his riches”; the young man who needed to return home to comfort his family, trapped by excuse after excuse? There are no excuses with _The Urantia Book_; it's all there for us to see and be motivated by. We know with absolute certainty that the Father of all creation desires a relationship with each of us. The question to each of us — to you-is: Do you truly, in your heart of hearts, want fellowship with the Universal Father?

“Behold, I stand at the door and knock.”

# Sharing One's Spiritual Life with One's Fellows 

by Satu Sihvo

## The Summing Up

The gospel of the kingdom is founded on the personal religious experience of the Jesus of Galilea. It was not the only way he shared his spiritual life. He showed forth the fruits of the spirit wherever he passed by. The secret of his unbroken communion with our Father was prayer and worship.

In other words Jesus was open inwards and outwards at the same time. His life is a unique and inspiring example of strong inner life with courageous outer life manifestations. Isn't that THE way we are called to go?

We need transforming inner life but we also need striving, conscious personal efforts to have it adjusted to the cosmic co-work in the middle of our everyday activities. Different small groups offer interesting possibilities for this. Groups can be well used for learning and spreading loving attitudes.

One example is the group started in Finland in August, 1989. The guidelines and principles come from the Center for Attitudinal Healing, Tiburon, CA. They are modified by the teachings of _The Urantia Book_ and they are now carried out within a Lutheran parish. The group has weekly meetings.

The “Evergreens” are used to find a useful, spiritual point of view to face the problems of life.

The aim of the group is to encourage and support each of us

- to take care of one's personal relationship with God (interaction with the Father) and
- to take a positive attitude toward oneself and others (coincident interaction with other people).


## Evergreens

1. The most essential thing in us is love. Love is eternal.
2. Love is present.
3. Prayer and worship give room for love.
4. Love transforms.
5. Giving and receiving are the same.
6. Health is inner peace-healing is letting go of fear.
7. We can aim at inner peace in all circumstances.
8. We can look for light rather than faults.
9. We can focus on the whole of life rather than the fragments.
10. We can learn to love ourselves and others by forgiving rather than judging.
11. We can perceive others extending love and/or asking for support.
12. We are students and teachers to each other.

## Guidelines

The following is a modification from the guidelines of the Center for Attitudinal Healing:

1. We want to learn positive being and interaction.
2. Our purpose is to work on ourselves, support each other and practice nonjudgmental listening and sharing of our own experiences.
3. We understand that each person's learning process is important, not our judgment of it. Being accepted as we are makes it easier to accept others rather than judge them.
4. When we risk and expose our own emotional state, our experience gives a chance for finding unity.
5. We respect each other as unique persons and recognize that each knows himself/herself better than anyone else. If we listen to the voice within, we will find our best answer.
6. We are here to support each other's inner guidance and assist one another to focus on what is meaningful to each of us rather than to confront or preach.
7. We prefer sharing what works for us rather than giving advice. We let other people find their own answers.
8. The roles of student and teacher are interchangeable and fluctuate regardless of age or experience.
9. All information shared in group is confidential.
10. We agree to keep in mind that we always have a possibility to aim at peace rather than conflict, support love rather than fear.

“The idealization and attempted service of truth, beauty, and goodness is not a substitute for genuine religious experience- spiritual reality.” (2095)

# Returning to Family-Council Practices 

by Bob Slagle, Ph.D.

## “...[T]He Family Is The Master Civilizer.” (913.2)

It was a joy to have about seventy people attend our workshop on Family Meetings. A fair number of parents represented families which had attempted family meetings in years past but had faltered for one reason or another, temporarily given them up, then returned to family-council practices with subsequent success. To me this is often the story of family meeting experiments and one strong reason for my claim that family meetings are never a failure, although some families may give them up for a shorter or longer duration. From my experience as a family counselor, even holding just one family meeting is worthwhile and much better than having none at all.

But what do I mean by a “Family Meeting”? Simply getting together to gripe at one another or have Dad or Mom lay down the law like the T.V. Cosbys or Simpsons do is not likely a family meeting in the best sense of the name. Family meetings are appointed gatherings of all family members who live under one roof in order to make decisions by family consensus. Historically, consensus in a town meeting hall meant that everyone gave a unified voice vote of “yea” or “nay” and no written vote or record was counted. In family meetings, consensus means that every person, child or adult, has equal veto power over any decision and that for a decision to count everyone must give their voluntary, uncoerced and informed consent to that decision. Not necessarily an easy process, but amazingly powerful.

There seem to be three essentials to family meetings: consensual agreements, commitment by all parties to abide by those agreements, and keeping a written record of all such family decisions in a family meeting notebook. These essentials have been discovered through trial and error by many families from all parts of the world who have experimented with alternatives, such as majority rule, Father knows best, Mother knows best, children know best, permissiveness, and numerous tactics of avoidance and default of family responsibilities.

Beyond these three essential ingredients families have and should have great latitude in holding family meetings in many different styles, each uniquely suited to the specialness of any given family. Beyond the three essentials-consensus, commitment, and notebookmost of what I have to say consists of suggestions for practical success that I have acquired through working with families as clients over the past twenty years.

The timing, style, traditions, and content of your family meeting is your family's prerogative and should not be dictated by an outsider (in my opinion). For example, many families like and feel comfortable using the family meeting as the vehicle for awarding money (allowance) for home chores and family-related work. Other families are repelled by the idea of having money or pay as a part of mutual family responsibilities based on love and caring. Some families accept corporeal punishment as an appropriate part of family meeting decisions. Other families hold this to be abuse and use other types of consequences.

The key commitment on the part of parents in holding family meetings is to foster a shift in sovereignty from parental sovereignty to family sovereignty, and to do this in a wise and developmentally appropriate manner. In other words, parents gradually give over their exclusive prerogative to “rule” their children by arbitrary authority to “rule” by the family as a whole. In this process children develop communication skills, teamwork, personal esteem, the ability to compromise, selfconfidence, and the true exercise of will (volition). Meanwhile, parents gain a sense of relief from the burdens of arbitrary parenting, freedom to love their children more and reprimand them less. And the family gains a sense of identity, unity, mutual respect, and harmony.

I notice from the life of Jesus that he went far to avoid exercising arbitrary authority. He earned his sovereignty-every bit of it. I cannot help but wonder if families also are not intended to run on the same principles. As I recall, justice is always a group function. On page(1146.1 of _The Urantia Book_, a Melchizedek says, “The Master, when on earth, admonished his followers that justice is never a personal act; it is always a group function. Neither do the Gods, as persons, administer justice. But they perform this very function as a collective whole, as the Paradise Trinity.” Does it not follow that true justice for a child must likewise be a group decision and not the personal act of a parent?

I find a strong mandate in _The Urantia Book_ to encourage families of readers and nonreaders alike to institute the type of family meetings that Jesus held with his brothers and sisters here on earth two thousand years ago.

On page(941.7 the Chief of Seraphim of our planet states in the section on marriage and family life: “Human society would be greatly improved if the civilized races would more generally return to the familycouncil practices of the Andites.” Who among us wouldn't like to see society “greatly improved”? This statement is made all the more profound when we realize that the Andites were themselves superhuman, being the progeny of the Adamites and the Nodites. (871-8,(892.6) I also cannot help but notice that the author of this statement is among the highest of the angels, a Primary Supernaphim from Paradise. (414.5) And this Primary Supernaphim further qualifies the nature of these family-council practices by saying, “They did not maintain the patriarchal or autocratic form of family government. They were very brotherly and associative, freely and frankly discussing every proposal and regulation of a family nature.”

I would venture to say that woven throughout _The Urantia Book_ are hundreds of clues, hints, and clearly explicit statements to support the idea that family meetings and a shift from parental sovereignty to family sovereignty affords the highest type of family living and family loving possible.

The tremendous importance of family relations is underscored many times in _The Urantia Book_ (e.g.,(931.1,(942.2). I am particulariy impressed with Jesus' talk with John Mark that Wednesday the lad spent alone with God in the hills of Judea. Jesus makes it clear to me that our early family life affects us greatly, not merely in this life and on the mansion worlds, but forever. “A human being's entire afterlife is enormously influenced by what happens during the first few years of existence.” (19224) The importance of family life to our world is emphasized in comments made by the mid wayers at the end of this section: “It is our sincere belief that the gospel of Jesus' teaching, founded as it is on the father-child relationship, can hardly enjoy a world-wide acceptance until such a time as the home life of the modern civilized peoples embraces more of love and more of wisdom.” (1922.5) Personally, I am convinced that family meetings provide a sure way to augment both love and wisdom in the home.

The authors of _The Urantia Book_ refer to Jesus' type of family-council practices by several terms; on page 1494.5 they use the phrase “family meeting,” which I use. In the section entitled “The Nineteenth Year,” I find the most explicit directions regarding the essentials of family meetings. Herein I find that Jesus invariably used the positive method of exhortation, that he refrained from emphasizing evil by forbidding it, that family meeting and prayer time went together, that Jesus used wise discipline early in his siblings' training, that he never arbitrarily disciplined his brothers or sisters, and that a watchword of their family was “faimess.” (1401) It seems likely that many decisions relating to family matters were made by consensus, and that even punishment was agreed upon by all and awaited the voluntary agreement of even the offending person before being imposed. The story regarding little Jude is most poignant in this regard: “On three occasions when it was deemed wise to punish Jude for self-confessed and deliberage violations of the family rules of conduct, his punishment was fixed by the unanimous decree of the older children and was assented to by Jude himself before it was inflicted.” (1401.4)

I note a parallel between the consensual nature of Jesus' family meetings and the technique of adjudication on the highest superuniverse levels. When a crea- ture has made a final and a complete choice of unreality regarding his universe destiny, the Universal Censor does not issue the extinction broadcast until there is consensus among all three of the Ancients of Days. In fact, annihilation must generally await the approval of the sinner himself. (217.7,(615.5,(611.6) This form of consensual justice is all the more impressive to me when we consider that the Ancients of Days are the most powerful, perfect, divine, and mighty rulers in the timespace creations. (210.1) Universal Censors impress me, too. On page(218.4 a Divine Counselor reveals that “...when a [Universal] Censor has spoken, no one else may speak, for the Censor has depicted the true and unmistakable total of all that has gone before. When he speaks, there is no appeal.” Yet, despite all this power and perfection of judgment, our heavenly Father asks that no action be taken until the sinner himself approves of the justness of the verdict. What noble evidence that justice is always a group function! I can even envision Trinity actions as commensurate with family meeting agreements, Indeed a mighty admonition rests overhead if we as human parents seek to rule our children by personal authority in place of family sovereignty.

Another intriguing parallel to the consensual family meeting process is manifested by Michael and his consort, the universe Mother Spirit, in the kind of consensus they reach with each other in ruling a vast universe. “...Both the Son and the Spirit function together, and in no creative act does the one do aught without the counsel and approval of the other.” (369.3) As you may recall, at the jubilee of jubilees the Divine Spirit pledges to Michael fidelity and obedience, and he, in turn, acknowledges eternal dependence on her and equality with her as co-ruler of their domains. “And this becomes the transcendent pattern for the family organization and government of even the lowly creatures of the worlds of space. This is, in deed and in truth, the high ideal of the family....” (369.1)

So it appears that from the lowest to the highest, from Urantia to Salvington and on to Uversa, the family meeting idea is the fabric of universe governance and justice. No wonder we are encouraged to return to the familycouncil practices of the Andites. In my book, A Family Meeting Handbook: Achieving Family Hamnony Happily, I attempt to integrate the highest concepts from The Umanfia Book, as they are found in many present day secular sources, with practical experiences in family living. I beseech parents to unburden themselves of the heaviness of personal authority and release themselves into the joy and light of consensual family meetings -family sovereignty- the Jesusonian approach to family harmony.

# Tadpoles, Butterflies and Lightosity 

by Chuck Burton

Back in March, I watched a made-for-TV version of The Phantom of the Opera broadcast on NBC. Not having seen the Broadway rendition — but planning to-I was curious about the story-line. I had seen clips of the old Lon Chaney horror flick and was expecting the usual run-of-the-mill, fright-night special. What I experienced was very different and, as a matter of fact, most inspirational. Instead of an evil monster who delighted in cruel and unusual murders, the Phantom turned out to be quite the opposite. Sure, there were some murders — an opera custodian and few pursuing policemen, and there was the incident when the chandelier crashed on the audience.

But, all in all, the Phantom possessed many noble human qualities. In fact, the Phantom was not inherently evil or even immoral. Due to a birth defect which deformed his face, he finds the world to be very cruel and intolerant-thus he wears a mask and hides from the world by living beneath the opera house. It is only after he hears the angelic voice of Christine that he decides to risk his cover and attempts to win her love. The Phantom gives her voice lessons and rescues her from an angry audience and eventually allows her to unmask him. The sight of his face causes her to faint and this crushes the poor Phantom. Nevertheless, the Phantom, at the close of the story actually triumphs, as it is Christine who realizes that it is her misconceptions about the nature of true beauty, her intolerance of a significant divergence from the norm, which is at the root of the problem. She and the Phantom sing a moving duet to the delight of the audience before the police eventually comer the Phantom and he is shot by a merciful father.

Hope none of you were waiting to see it the second time around!

Shortly after I saw this movie, I came across this quotation on page 597 of _The Urantia Book_:

“Only ethical consciousness can unmask the immorality of human intolerance and the sinfulness of fratricidal strife. Only a moral conscience can condemn the evils of national envy and racial jealousy. Only moral beings will ever seek for that spiritual insight which is essential to living the golden rule.”

I don't want to dwell on a discussion of either ethical or moral consciousness, but I do want to focus on the subjects of human intolerance and spiritual insight, because I feel that they relate to the subject of this afternoon's segment, “Sharing One's Spiritual Life with One's Fellows.”

When I first volunteered for this presentation, I said to myself, “Sure, I know something about the spiritual life.” In my mind the spiritual life consists of one's sovereign relationship with the fragment of God within. One's outer life or his relationship with others is a direct reflection of this inner life. The more one loves God the
Father, the more spiritual fruit will that person bear, although the outward expression will be as varied as the configuration of snowflakes. It gets scary on the mansion worlds, as the morontia form will actually be visible and will reveal the inner self for all to see-sort of like a spiritual nudist colony — no masks allowed.

“Sharing One's Spiritual Life with One's Fellows” ...After a month of mulling this subject over, I realized that I would hardly be able to pass myself off as any type of an expert on the subject. I got scared. So I went to a study group consisting of a number of long-time readers of _The Urantia Book_ for help. I sort of wanted to get them to unmask and I stated that I felt that the esserice of the teachings dealt with this subject. Casting aside the lofty philosophy, cosmology and theology contained within 2097 pages, the rubber truly meets the road in our interactions with others-or so I stated. I asked each member present to explain briefly how they attempted to share their spiritual life. I thought you might find some of the responses interesting.

One study group member stated that sharing one's spirituality “required a new way of living and a brand new change in perspective.” This response conjured up in my mind Jesus' injunction that those who are to enter the kingdom must first be reborn of the spirit.

Another person emphasized the value of listening in order to detect the needs of the person before her. This made me think of the quote, “To those Jesus taught the most, he said the least.”

A third member stated that he took on service projects such as library placement of Urantia Books and visiting those who were ill or in hospitals. My first thought was that Jesus' whole bestowal mission was a sort of service project, as much of his time was spent ministering to the sick and the downtrodden.

Still another reader discussed the importance of all interpersonal relationships. Having first approached the teachings from a more or less intellectual standpoint and later having pursued organizational experience in the former URANTIA Brotherhood, she felt that just getting to know and trying to understand one's fellows was paramount. I couldn't help thinking that indeed it is our relationships which are our only true endseverything else is scaffolding.

A fifth reader explained quite simply that he concentrated on just trying to be a good friend to those who would accept his friendship. This made me recall how each apostle considered the Master to be his best friend.

Finally, the last person said that he simply tried to always be happy and thankful for the gift of life and the assurance of sonship.

In all these accounts, it was my perception that not one person would have claimed that they had achieved any special expertise in this area of sharing one's spirituality.

I think they all would acknowledge some sort of tadpole station and admit that it required persistence to be successful. Interestingly enough, not one person attempted to equate sharing _The Urantia Book_ with sharing one's spirituality. Nonetheless, it is from The Urantia B o o k, the most authoritative guide that I have ever known, that I derive my concept of spirituality. Furthermore, it is its teachings which help to provide me with a philosophical framework to interpret experience.

Now, if you will allow me-and I guess if you don't walk out, you're allowing me-I would like to tell you about three people that I have known.

Al Ceicel is an easygoing bricklayer with not more than a high school education — sort of an average Joe (or an average Al, in this case). I've known Al for about four years. He attends an Evangelical Free Church. He's a caring husband and an involved father. I met him through a YMCA program called “Indian Princesses,” which is a program for fathers and daughters. He and I revived a tribe that was on the brink of extinction. As chief, Al was like a big kid. He liked wearing Indian clothes; he attended long house meetings, representing our tribe, where he planned and coordinated eventscamp-outs, roller-skating parties, sock-hops and pet shows-for a nation of 14 tribes consisting of over 200 dads and daughters. He likes to make Indian gear and spends a lot of his free time making head-dresses for nation officers and mendellas, or leather insignias, for each of the other tribes. This YMCA program was better because of him, yet Al never sought any personal recognition. He made his contribution quietly without fanfare.

As I got to know Al better, I found that he had other outlets for social service. He did volunteer work for the Iwanas, the name of his church's youth association. One Saturday he applied his bricklaying skills to constructing an elevated brick retaining wall for a flower bed, which anchored an announcement marquee. In addition, Al assists the local grade school in a Market-Day Program and delivers food to those parents who ordered it. Al finds time to do this while running a growing business that employs over one hundred workers. Also, he has a retarded son who requires a regular dosage of ritalin to curb hyperactivity, Never complains ...quite a guy, Al Ceicel!

During my senior year in college, I was accepted for an overseas seminar at the University of Copenhagen. Instead of dormitories, American students were placed with Danish families, and that is where I met Sigrid Hansen-my “Danish mother.” My roommate and I were told immediately upon arrival that we were to call her “Mor” and her husband “Far” — Danish for Mother and Father. The second day in Denmark was my birthday, and Mor threw a special party for me by inviting her children and a few of the neighbors.

While in Denmark for four months, we literally became part of the Hansen's family. She cooked breakfasts in the morning, packed sack lunches and served dinner in the evenings. We said prayers at dinner and had moments of silence. Every evening at(8.00, each member of the family stopped whatever they were doing and, according to Danish custom, sat down together again for tea and a pastry. Unlike American families, this was a special time set aside for all of us to share our daylaugh, exchange ideas, get help in navigating Copenhagen, or hear about the history and culture of Denmark. Most of our conversations were with Mor, who spoke French and German, as well as English. Far, Ludwig Hansen, spoke no English (although he knew German). We smiled a lot and I spoke on occasion with him in broken German.

In the spring we took a family vacation for a weekend at a place called MonsKlint, kind of a White Cliffs of Denmark. It wasn't long before Gerry, my roommate, and I discovered that we were Mor's seventeenth and eighteenth American sons. She was a woman of about sixty and had been doing this sort of thing for eight years. The last time I heard from her was about seven years ago when she was on numbers forty-one and forty-two. She was truly an amazing person, and she enriched my overseas experience immeasurably.

One other thing worthy of note: Our rooms were in a finished attic-complete with kitchenette and bathroom. It was about a week before we left Denmark that we learned over tea that when the Nazis occupied Denmark, Sigrid and Ludwig and their three children lived up there for over three years. The occupying Nazi officers lived in the house proper. One of the most joyous days of their lives was when the Allied troops liberated Denmark. Maybe her interest in American students initially was motivated by a desire to repay the U.S. for this effort....but I'm only speculating.

I want to relate one more experience I had during my college years. I had the good fortune to work as a deckhand on a brigantine in the Caribbean. Does anyone know what a brigantine is? Well, it's like an old pirate ship — square sails on the front mast and a gaff rig on the aftermast. It's about 120 feet long, carries about 18 passengers, has 12 different sails and a jillion ropes. During the four-plus months I was on the ship, we sailed and motored from the Virgin Islands to Trinidad, went into dry dock for the worst month of the hurricane season, and spent the last three months island-hopping up the Lesser Antilles. This story is about the man who owned and ran the ship, Captain Arthur Kimberly.

The Captain was about 50-plus, short, crewcut, weighed about 150 pounds with an average build and was strong as an ox for his size. He had an archaic Masters of the Seas degree (nobody gets these any more) from some nautical school in Mystic, Connecticut. If there ever was a guy in the world who knew everything there was to know about sailing, it was he. He knew about the harbors in the Gallapagos and the sunken reefs in Tahiti and how to navigate Cape Horn; he knew the names of all the woodhulled ships still in existence; he knew about the wrecks of the Spanish galleys and exploits of Drake, Hawkins and other sea dogs. It seemed he had read every novel ever written about the sea from Treasure Island to Wolf Larson. He was highly defensive of Captain Bly and scorned Mr. Christian for his treacherous actions. He enjoyed his rum in the eve-
ning, and he enjoyed telling off-color stories to the crew. But most of all, he loved the sea, which had been his life since dropping out of high school, and he loved his ship. He had been married on it, and he sailed around the world twice on it in the ten years or so that he had owned it. The Brigantine Romance was his child; he had no other.

As for his crew, he seemed to hold the attitude that it was their good fortune to be even allowed to set foot on it. We were paid   3.00 plus room and board per day. We worked from(6.00 a.m. sometimes until(8.00 or(9.00 p.m. We right-sailed and we had to come to at $2: 00 a . m. to take our turn at the wheel. You had to call each rope and each part of the ship by its proper and correct name or get chewed out. You couldn't call the focs'l of the ship the “bedroom” or the bulwark the “wall,” and all hell would break loose if you called the head the “bathroom.” There were different knots for different situations, and you had to learn them all. Sometimes the Captain would climb up the eighty-foot mast to check the royal or top square sail. If he ever found a granny, you'd be on KP for a week.

After the first month, just like a kid at camp, I counted the days until I got off the ship. I worked hard and did as I was told (with a few exceptions), but I longed for a McDonald's and couldn't wait to drive a land ship, which didn't require the effort or the maintenance of this remnant of 1830 .

But, you know, when I did get off that ship, I knew that I had had an experience that few have had. I had seen a part of the world and a way of life which were unique. When I got off that ship, I was stronger physically than I had ever been.

One more thing about Captain Kimberly...well, the Captain had one bad eye. He didn't wear a patch or anything, but wherever he looked, the pupil and the iris sort of just pointed down and in. I had heard from his wife that he lost it about ten years earlier, when a taut rope snapped because the crew member tied a granny instead of a clove hitch. You know, Captain had his own ships for some 25 years and he had never had a major accident at sea. I don't know where he is now, but I do know that if he had been at the helm of the Exxon Valdez, there would have been no oil spill. Arthur Kimberly wasn't what one would call a warm, gentle person, yet he possessed a unique passion for life and a quest for perfection in his arena and he actively sought to share those traits, as well as his knowledge of the sea, with all who stepped aboard.

I share my personal experiences of these people with you because the experience of knowing them enriched my life. All three are of ordinary intelligence with varied levels of education and religious background, yet all, I feel, are in their own way spiritual. None of them knows a darned thing about reflectivity, fusion, Orvonton or the absonite level of reality. None of them in their wildest dreams (or nightmares) would ever imagine or expect I would praise their contributions to my life. Yet, in their own way, each has given me a gift which was both inspirational and experientially priceless.
In no way am I trying to denigrate readers of _The Urantia Book_. I could just as easily recall episodes about how my association with a number of Urantia Book students has added to my personal growth and enhanced my life. What I am attempting to illustrate is that the Spirit of God is active in all of us and is able to find expression in a multitude of ways.

_The Urantia Book_ on page 2059 lists eleven ways to gauge spirituality — “By their fruits shall you know them.” I have known many other people who, in my opinion, were way ahead of me, yet they would either take no interest in or have any use for _The Urantia Book_ or would wholeheartedly reject it. What is the difference? What does this say? To me it underscores what has often been said: _The Urantia Book_ is a means, a tool, a guide to an end, and not an end in itself; that differences among religionists largely stem from differences in theology and philosophy. The intellectual realm, the domain of the mind, is quite different from that of the spirit.

There once was a charismatic, ecumenical teacher shortly after the turn of the century, who had an interest in science-specifically the speed of electricity. So he asked twenty-five of his students, representing most of the religions of the world, to line up on a damp cellar floor and join hands. He then proceeded to wire the first and turn the switch releasing the current. There were three lessons which could be drawn from the experiment: (1) the teacher obviously was either very persuasive or very powerful; (2) electricity did indeed travel quickly; and (3) the unity exhibited by the diversity of those religionists at that particular moment in time has never before or since been seen on this planet.

One thing _The Urantia Book_ does as a tool is to expand the concepts about the nature of God the Father and the functioning of Deity. Said Jesus at Jotapata, “Worship makes one increasingly like the being who is worshiped.” (1641) Thus the better one's understanding and knowledge about the Creator, the First Source and Center, the Heavenly Father, the better will one be able to discern his will and become more God-like and hence more spiritual. C.S. Lewis has a story about this which I will share in my closing.

And where better than an epochal revelation presented in this century does one find a more unified, comprehensive or a more authoritative presentation about the nature of God? If we indeed believe this, that we possess the highest truth about Deity, how are we to avoid the chosen people syndrome and its accompanying intolerance and arrogance? Have you ever observed a child after he gets his hands on a flashlight for the first time? I think that his first act, and this is universal, is to point the flashlight directly into your eyes so that you become temporarily blinded by the light.

The history books are filled with examples of religious groups who felt that they alone knew the truth. Of course, _The Urantia Book_ authors speak frequently about the chosen people attitude of the Jewish people at the time of Jesus. The story about the Good Samaritan focused on this attitude as did the arrogant Hebrew belief in a special Messiah who would oust the Romans
for them. Later in history we get to the revolt against the Roman Catholic Church, known as the Reformation. It was the belief of such reformers as Martin Luther that the individual could read the Scriptures to discover truth -not be dependent upon an ecclesiastical hierarchy who believed themselves to be the special ambassadors of God and who alone could interpret and determine truth. The Inquisition epitomizes the intolerance of this era.

The Puritans of Massachusetts Bay are a strange phenomenon. Because their desire to cleanse the Anglican Church of its vestiges of Roman Catholicism apparently failed, many left for the New World. And low and behold, before long, in their attempt to establish a Zion in the wilderness, as God's chosen people, they instead established a theocracy. Free thinkers like Roger Williams, Anne Hutchinson and Thomas Hooker fled or were expelled, and they initiated their own ways of worshiping. Instead of unifying religionists, the strict interpretation of truth and rigid social requirements backfired on their leaders. The witch-hunts of Salem marked the apex of intolerance and the beginning of the end of Puritan control.

The Mormons of the mid-nineteenth century are one last illustration. These people believed that they were the special recipients of divine truth, The Book of Mormon. Their special book was taken from gold tablets discovered by Joseph Smith in 1830, and thousands of converts soon after joined this new faith. However, each time they tried to establish their own “ideal society,” they were persecuted and driven off. In Kirkland, Ohio; in Independence, Missouri; in Navoo, Illinois. It wasn't just the practice of polygamy but rather their exclusivity and chosen-people attitude that brought on conflict and forced most to migrate westward to Utah.

Jesus spoke to Nathaniel (1768) regarding the authority of the Scriptures, and the proclaimed authority of religious leaders to interpret them. "Nathaniel, never forget, the Father does not limit the revelation of truth to any one generation or to any one people. Many earnest seekers after the truth have been, and will continue to be, confused and disheartened by these doctrines of the perfection of the Scriptures.

"The authority of truth is the very spirit that indwells its living manifestations, and not the dead words of the less illuminated and supposedly inspired men of another generation. And even if these holy men of old lived inspired and spirit-filled lives, that does not mean that their words were similarly spiritually inspired. Today we make no record of the teachings of this gospel of the kingdom lest, when I have gone, you speedily become divided up into sundry groups of truth contenders as a result of the diversity of your interpretation of my teachings. For this generation it is best that we live these truths while we shun the making of records.

"Mark you well my words, Nathaniel, nothing which human nature has touched can be regarded as infallible. Through the mind of man divine truth may indeed shine forth, but always of relative purity and partial divinity. The creature may crave infallibility, but only the Creators possess it.
“But the greatest error of the teaching about the Scriptures is the doctrine of their being sealed books of mystery and wisdom which only the wise minds of the nation dare to interpret. The revelations of divine truth are not sealed except by human ignorance, bigotry, and narrow-minded intolerance.”

I believe that often ignorance is a cause of intolerance. Sometimes the desire for power is the culprit. But why do intelligent, unselfish and sincere people desirous for the greatest good become intolerant? I believe that this often stems from elevating one truth to an absolute- or to a level higher than it merits. I believe that in the human desire to simplify life, to make sense out of it, man tends to embrace easy and simple formulas for living. “Actions speak louder than words” was and still is one of my formulas I use to determine if someone is being sincere and genuine. But this adage was taught to me before I was ten. Sometimes words and actions are one and the same. Obviously, the tool is simplistic and has its limitations.

If you take any virtue to its extreme, it ceases to be a virtue. For example, one can over-love someone to the point of smothering them. One can be overly sincere and hence tactless. One can be too meek and thus become a weakling. Being overly courageous can result in foolhardiness. In fact, if you take any fruit of the spirit to its extreme it becomes overly ripe or rotten fruit.

In the writing of “The Acme of Religious Living,” every virtue, every fruit exhibited by the Master is qualified or tempered: “enthusiastic, not fanatical”; “emotionally active, not flights”; “imaginative but practical”; “frank, but unerringly fair”; “courageous, not reckless”; “prudent, not cowardly”; “sympathetic, not sentimental”; “unique, not eccentric”; “pious, not sanctimonious”; “cheerful, not blindly optimistic”; “generous, not wasteful”; “candid, but kind.”

When I was a kid, I was constantly being told that I didn't know when to quit. Whether it was asking for something or teasing or just trying to get my way. You know, I still don't know when to quit-either when speaking before a group or determining the limits of virtues — and I don't think any of us really knows. I guess this is where the Adjuster comes in to assist each of us to become more balanced, more unified and more symmetrical, sort of like a butterfly.

But when I'm not quite sure what's coming from within, I believe the best refuge is to fall back on simple sincerity. Sincerity, more sincerity and more sincerity are indeed “the keys to the kingdom.” It doesn't always work and often failure may result, but if one sincerely attempts to learn from his mistakes, he will grow and the quality of his decisions will improve and he will better align his will to that of the Father's.

There is an old Chinese tale about the woman whose only son died. In her grief, she went to the holy man and said, “What prayers, what magical incantations do you have to bring my son back to lifer” Instead of sending her away or reasoning with her, he said to her, "Fetch me a mustard seed from a home that has never known sorrow. We will use it to drive the sorrow out of your
life.“ The woman set off at once to sincerely search for that magical mustard seed. She came first to a splendid mansion, knocked at the door, and said, ”I am looking for a home that has never known sorrow. Is this such a place? It is very important to me.“ They told her, ”You've certainly come to the wrong place,“ and began to describe all the tragic things that had recently befallen them. The woman said to herself, ”Who is better able to help these poor unfortunate people than I, who have had misfortune of my own?" She stayed to comfort them, then went on in her search for a home that had never known sorrow. But wherever she turned, in hovels and palaces, she found one tale after another of sadness and misfortune. Ultimately, she became so involved in ministering to other people's grief that she forgot about her quest for the magical mustard seed, never realizing that it had in fact driven the sorrow out of her life.

I found it interesting to recently read Winston Churchill's physician biographer, Lord Moran, and what he wrote about why a proud nation followed this man through the long crisis of World War II.

“He was not, I think, a sage. He does not seem to have been a soldier of genius. He was not, perhaps, a born administrator. What is the ultimate secret of Winston Churchill's mastery over men?...Sincerity is the one quality I would have chosen as most typical of him. He was indeed the most truthful of politicians.”

At Ramah, Jesus spoke to an old Greek philosopher ('1641): “For more than an hour Jesus taught this Greek the saving truths of the gospel of the kingdom. The old philosopher was susceptible to the Master's mode of approach, and being sincerely honest of heart, he quickly believed this gospel of salvation.”

Jesus response to the apostles after this teaching episode was:

“My children, marvel not that I was tolerant of the Greek's philosophy. True and genuine inward certainty does not in the least fear outward analysis, nor does truth resent honest criticism. You should never forget that intolerance is the mask covering up the entertainment of secret doubts as to the trueness of one's belief. No man is at any time disturbed by his neighbor's attitude when he has perfect confidence in the truth of that which he wholeheartedly believes. Courage is the confidence of thoroughgoing honesty about those things which one professes to believe. Sincere men are unafraid of the critical examination of their true conviction and noble ideals.”

I would like to close with one last tale borrowed from C.S. Lewis, author and theologian. And you probably guessed it...it's about masks and becoming spiritual. There once was a man with few friends who, at a certain stage in his life, took a long hard look in the mirror and realized he was quite ugly. He made a conscious decision to wear a mask that made him look much nicer than he really was. He had to wear this mask for years and when he finally took it off, his face had almost magically transformed itself to fit the mask to a tee. He had become truly beautiful. What had begun as a disguise had become a reality. C.S. Lewis utilizes this story to embellish a concept which he terms “dressing up as Christ” in order to join him as a son of God. To me, this tale is just about achieving lightosity.
