At some unimaginable level of reality totality, God exists alone — undifferentiated and beyond the need to conceive of unity. This is the static level wherein God is wholly self-contained and self-existent. However, within this static totality, there also must be present — and identical in fact and truth — absolute, infinite diversity, and absolute, eternal unity. Always, at this level of God's unfathomable existence, must infinite diversity be eternally unified, And yet, somehow, such lowly will creatures as Urantian mortals have become a conscious part of God's majestic exploration of his infinity.

As an absolutely unique personality existence, each mortal is an expression of God's diversity. And, consequently, each mortal is charged with the awesome responsibility to aid in the maintenance of absolute, universal unity by choosing to unify his mortal portion of infinity. And this process, described in many different ways in _The URANTIA Book_, and experienced differentially by each mortal, is the doing of the Father's will, and is a part of the eternal process of becoming perfect as is the Father.

The sonship experience makes our participation in this process — God's self-experience — real. The experience of our relationships with other personalities makes real God's infinite diversity — because while each person may not be God, surely God is each person. Through prayer, we are able to sense the plane where diversity and unity begin to merge as the divine mixes with the mortal. And finally, in the experience of worship the eternal unity of God becomes increasingly real to the mortal personality striving to become Godlike, for in worship, only God exists.

The quest for God is the endless experience of his infinity. That which God is existentially he has given us the awareness to appreciate experientially, In the bestowal of unique, creature personality, God has willfully asked each creature to experience his peerless existence from an absolutely unique point of view, a view which we can only describe to one another, yet which we can share intimately only with God. And this is the sharing of the son with the Father, as the Father gently urges the son to perfect the ability to unify the mortal's sphere of infinity with the divine glue of the universe love.
