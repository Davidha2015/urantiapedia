We wish you could be with us each day as letters come in from all over the world telling us of the excitement and joy of the discovery of the fifth epochal revelation. These are heart-warming testaments to the effect "The URANTIA Book" is beginning to have in renewing and uplifting the knowledge of our personal relationship with the heavenly Father and with each other.

The distribution of "The URANTIA Book" is moving forward at a phenomenal rate. If "The URANTIA Book" keeps selling at its present rate of one thousand per month (In November we sold one thousand seventy-nine), we wlll shortly be preparing for our fifth printing.

## News from Urantia Foundation - December 1973

We continue to receive at headquarters many interesting visitors from within the United States and from foreign countries. and we have developed warm friendships with many of these sincere truth seekers.

Much time and effort has been expended towards the realization of bona fide translations of _The Urantia Book_ under the auspices of the Trustees. We are most gratified to continue to enjoy the willing and unselfish cooperation of friends in Finland in the preparation of a Finnish translation.

As the spread of _The Urantia Book_ increases, the work load at headquarters likewise grows—though at a geometric rate. necessitating increased staff and expenses. The Foundation recently inaugurated a continuing drive to obtain the funds so necessary to our operations, present and future.
