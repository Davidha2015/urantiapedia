Wonderment and revelation 
Span the cosmos with their joys, 
And among the hosts of heaven, 
Each his spirit-love employs

Just to win another mortal
To the Father’s timeless plan, 
And to cheer him in his progress 
Toward the bliss awaiting man,

Never can there be an ending; 
Never can adventure halt,
For each level of the journey 
Leads each person to exalt

Everything the Father wishes, 
All the love he would express, 
Giving us the joys of sonship 
And eternal happiness.

How can I withhold my service? 
How can I allow a day
Here to pass without exhorting 
Everyone to find his way

Through the tumult of this planet 
‘Til the time he must depart, 
Soon again in loftier mansions 
To resume? In truth, to start

In that climb that leads him Godward, 
Ne’er again to be a man
On this splendid world of wonder, 
Ne’er to be its dust again.

For each person is an offspring 
Of the Father’s will-to-love,
And he’ll draw his far-flung family 
Home to endless joys above.

David Glass
